The packaging has reused art but a new sleek design. The discs are very practical and say what episodes are on it with Text that says one piece episodes ?-?. The overall set design is very well made and the new disc art makes it very easy to find a certain episode . The collections are rereleases of the voyage DVD sets. the voyages were expensive, they were sold at 50 bucks only offering 11-13 episodes. The first collection rereleases season 1 voyages 1 and 2. I suggest buying the first 2 collections which is all of the season 1 voyages with a total of 53 episodes. One piece is colorful and for a shonen anime its original. The pacing in one piece is good. in the first 53 episodes you go through around 5 arcs and those 5 arcs make the first saga. Unlike naruto or bleach which have 3 arcs at most in each saga that make over 60 episodes. One pieces fights are full of life. This anime will hook you.

I thought Charlize Theron was magnificent as Mavis, but I also want to highlight Beth/Elizabeth Reaser's performance.  She is not just a passive good wife.  She is not just a nice ordinary person.  She is no pushover.  You see glimpses of how funny, quirky and smart she is, so you understand why Buddy/Patrick Wilson is mesmerized - and completely in love with her; he is following her lead.  Elizabeth Reaser's performance is just perfect - from her smiles welcoming Mavis, her enthusiasm playing the drums, and the hurt look on her face when Mavis/Charlize Theron bellows at her.  Beth is essential to the story, more than Buddy, and her performance reinforces Mavis's desperation and loss.",1.0,125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08850367228661368,0.0,0.23101220086813862,0.0,0.05854781998761929,0.06935227375115277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05408038973166351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07193963759580439,0.0,0.0,0.07033366579087401,0.0,0.07044319169828568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669634085126281,0.648278212940736,0.0,0.0,0.09243182707073941,0.0,0.047163230887893544,0.0,0.3470388847935553,0.0,0.0,0.22255166836525858,0.0,0.0876270647538448,0.0,0.0,0.0763004109082099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0863546166582109,0.12164178128882895,0.04203618432776484,0.05804717341868739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368317175522602,0.08272944000205235,0.0,0.3938525798716335,0.0,0.0694467357124326,0.0,0.1625620206533192,0.08613742323183081,0.0,0.14606772494159095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040747907807494176,0.0,0.08403140096473656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056259763677383626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846178632426136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055274495205522196,0.0,0.1212973473383222,
756168,B00009P9ME,A220FJEQNGMSRN,14,14,1153267200,The best Asterix film - in two very different versions,"For those not in the know, the Asterix books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of indomitable Gauls who resist Caesar's invasion thanks to a magic potion that renders them invulnerable supermen. There have been several animated features (only one of them, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original screen story) before a perfectly cast Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu took the lead roles in two big-budget live action adaptations that proved colossally successful throughout Europe but made no impression whatsoever in the English-speaking world.This follow-up to Asterix and Obelix Take On Caesar/Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar is easily the most successful attempt to get the books mixture of slapstick, anachronisms and highbrow classical humorous asides to the screen, mixing classical references (such as a great Raft of the Medusa sight gag or the Sphinx's broken nose inspiring Depardieu's Obelix to quote Cyrano de Bergerac), alongside more modern pop-culture references - mobile phones, Star Wars and even The Benny Hill Show. It's also incredibly spectacular and lavishly designed, putting many recent epics to shame. Some of the subtitles, however, leave a little to be desired, with joke names such as Matthieukassovix changed to Lennykravix for Anglophone consumption (very jarring when you can still hear the originals), but that's a minor complaint compared to the Miramax cut also included here. Not all of it works, but it's still great fun.Despite paying a reputed $45m for both films, in a classic case of buyer's remorse Miramax completely re-edited the film (at least 21 minutes gone) and crudely dubbed it into English. Maybe Harvey Weinstein mistook it for a Hong Kong movie. Whereas Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar was lovingly dubbed into English from a particularly good translation script by Terry Jones but otherwise left unaltered, that sort of thing really isn't the Miramax way. The results ain't good.Aside from the voices for Gerard Depardieu and Monica Bellucci just seeming very, very wrong, a lot of the classical references are gone (the Raft of the Medusa and Cyrano gags among them), the pirates are reduced to a single sequence, alongside anything that seems too French or might slow the picture down, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real slog. Several punchlines to sequences are missing, Depardieu's part has been trimmed (his part was already fairly small because of his serious health problems during the shoot: the US version has been partially digitally regraded to change the unhealthy pallor of his face in the original!), and as usual with dubbing, because literal translations into English don't fit properly, lines are either rushed so much they're not funny anymore or the dialogue has been changed completely. A couple of these changes are admittedly funny, like one character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in French and hear the words in English, so it's not quite a total disaster, but very disappointing.Still, Pathe's UK DVD gives you the choice of both versions in excellent transfers, even if it is at the cost of any extras (the French DVD was a lavish two-disc set, but without English subtitles). But you'd definitely be better off sticking to the uncut subtitled French version even if you're buying it for the kids - tell them think of it as a reading a book with moving pictures!",1.0,572,0.032591397615587145,0.0,0.02764849802821965,0.07587499019485623,0.02998317114221824,0.1815447580233219,0.18651953758774473,0.10038713993933851,0.059456324860947075,0.0564310165939925,0.08016747940276514,0.15331299003521048,0.0,0.16227260712611283,0.031071643258034447,0.03301924417545066,0.0,0.03991571683460366,0.0766285391472891,0.10965819185573032,0.030837247518534686,0.03707586176971705,0.13499633150380677,0.0602976810382367,0.03686426551089882,0.06039157857871424,0.06236102556379116,0.0,0.09585712239604892,0.02643219288331361,0.03287622965081812,0.0,0.0,0.1277503139922279,0.0,0.061652625835468496,0.18195056938592855,0.11621933966197386,0.03718994266089841,0.16277517762029325,0.0,0.031799256118959444,0.030248139309031277,0.0,0.04073789092968101,0.0,0.03270651250930955,0.03914395962359469,0.024073696222052434,0.0,0.03687266843906974,0.0,0.0370162927872844,0.10428458756700347,0.3603799696999401,0.024882180593133348,0.05314557918606185,0.0367388211460554,0.09923058068965519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174233195476805,0.0,0.044090962078397924,0.0,0.043048573452290066,0.05953730794561143,0.033339097884423935,0.034841468733586685,0.0,0.13327403535842133,0.5948195462299619,0.0,0.1582201107542871,0.0,0.03165648355740215,0.03125356412570421,0.017466772990741525,0.0,0.2341328339092805,0.040157886523752316,0.08232981367159262,0.03408742848397908,0.1317711543486064,0.0723479982315727,0.0,0.04051280686526307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03363299575154849,0.03713996728501118,0.0315266321485367,0.0,0.09477463868759639,0.0,0.10398930125918969,
400775,6304092024,A3JPPR6JT75N0E,20,20,1086134400,What Hollywood has Lost,"There was a time when Randolph Scott sat as tall in the saddle as John Wayne. It is most unfortunate that most of his work is not on DVD and some of his best (The Tall T) aren't even currently on VHS! Scott's westerns of the 50's decade revealed a versatile and talented actor, which is remarkable for a star who was instantly recognizable and reliable to play a hero of certain standards. One thing that is that is also remarkable about these films (and The Tall T immediately comes to mind) is they certainly didn't need a big budget. Instead, a good, suspenseful script, excellent cast, and dare I say, a redeeming morality made for an excellent and classic film.After watching all kinds of Westerns: Spaghetti, modern revisionist, Hollywood 40's, 50's, 60's, & 70's, I sat down to watch a few Randolph Scott movies and was literally on the edge of my seat. And this was right after sitting through the over-the-top effects wizardry of Van Helsing! Mr. Scott's extraordinary but ordinary characters made me forget I was watching a movie and drew me into the story and issues as if they were happening to me.Randolph Scott is virtually relegated to obscurity today compared to the major Western star he was many years ago. This is our loss. A boxed set* or two of his great Westerns would be a small step in the right direction of returning him to his proper status in film history. More importantly, after watching just a few of his movies and the realistic honor portrayed by him, I am left with the distinct feeling that the world was a better place with Randy in the saddle, and his kind will not ride through again.*It's here!

Her sisters had grown up, they all did well and had decent husbands or men, it was time for her to move on. Now it is a shame when your own brothers in law got to pay top dollars to take their sister in law out of their hands. Nevertheless, I really thought the movie would have been a bit much, but I judged wrong. This was really a good picture.

873369,B0006SSOHC,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,2,4,1109894400,"If You SAW It and Liked It, You SAW What You Wanted To","Two men awaken to find themselves chained to thick metal piping at the opposite ends of an old abandoned bathroom. Adam (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer; Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, The Princess Bride) is a surgeon. Both men have no idea how they ended up in this room together. Nor how a dead body laying between them got there. In the dead body's hands are a gun and a micro-cassette tape player.They soon discover a micro-cassette tape in each of their pockets, and quickly uncover a creepy message that awaits them by their captor. The ""jigsaw"" killer has caught them: a psychopath who doesn't necessarily ""kill"" people, but helps them kill themselves . . . or survive by killing others.**********************************************************************The psychology surrounding the events is sound enough: the slow descent into suspicion of each other, the lack of external stimulation that leads to a decline in mental faculties, and the eventual near insanity that would insue if you found out you had to kill someone in order to save yourself and/or your loved ones. Do they deserve to die anymore than you do?Where this film fell a bit short was in acting and plot. The acting was subpar. Cary Elwes, who I absolutely LOVED in The Princess Bride, here comes off like an amateur (could be that they were pressed for time and money, filming on a budget of $1.2 million and in 18 days). Makenzie Vega, Elwes' wife in the film, was flat, uncharming, and a bore. As were the estimable Danny Glover (Grand Canyon), and Ken Leung (Rush Hour and Red Dragon).There were also enough plot holes to make this film resemble swiss cheese. There was the fact that the main antagonist turns out to be someone who could NEVER have pulled off such cases (mainly because he was deathly ill); Dr. Gordon was allowed to sit and watch the interrogation of a survivor of the Jigsaw Murderer (which NEVER would have happened if, as the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the ""game"" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together. But, what I didn't understand, is that if this psycho enjoyed watching people tear themselves or others apart, why would he give them a way out, with simple clues and instructions? Didn't make sense to me.For the horror fan, though, I'm sure this film will be coveted and hailed as a great film of 2004. For me, though, it's a pretty big disappointment.",0.5,440,0.0,0.0,0.033113740140339847,0.045436549679821595,0.10772971502177657,0.27672969000949926,0.03191265834235491,0.12023053339065014,0.03560448906004834,0.10137849174165427,0.04800703962182192,0.0,0.0,0.05552823405540206,0.14885413587815763,0.0,0.13900289876765268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22159683320154314,0.0,0.08084043908558167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03734392358848582,0.0883627721397204,0.03826835775290886,0.0949710286885064,0.07874966114543966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490641900362261,0.14767883801872955,0.21791649828077408,0.04639742104520515,0.13362368861956164,0.04332238491874043,0.0,0.0,0.036227249081875634,0.0,0.0,0.08893198420901109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04433325452492221,0.0,0.17264632105870367,0.029800608389108953,0.0,0.0,0.11884535860061884,0.04537151668020463,0.15450696186333548,0.10037127597705113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04422175045223367,0.1862211610232982,0.4124402183774715,0.08995188360781355,0.23686908901641615,0.0,0.11374193663686578,0.14972565958001993,0.12551644172107645,0.04045796330732414,0.30198383616944313,0.0,0.04930191963666798,0.040825445480576275,0.0,0.23106381746729848,0.04584323945588656,0.048520919925663014,0.0,0.0,0.18339521262551248,0.039011445039721517,0.0,0.044481375597377276,0.11327537974046885,0.04167634808893405,0.02837715410609731,0.12726640579170348,0.1245447291841211,

1633239,B00BEJL4RO,A14GK0E64J0WAS,9,16,1363910400,"3.5 stars... intriguing, if flawed, movie","""Spring Breakers"" (2013 release; 93 min.) is the latest movie from writer-director Harmony Korine, best known for writing the controversial 1995 movie ""Kids"" and his subsequent directorial debut ""Gummo"" a few years later. His latest project has been buzzed about for months, due mostly as a result of an intruiging premise: 4 girls, including once Disney TV ""good girls"" Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez (the other 2 girls are played by Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine), descend on Florida for spring break and become ""bad girls"". As the movie starts, we see Selma's character (Faith) as being ""the shy one"", while the other girls are ready to rock, except they don't have any money. The three girls decide to rob a fast food/diner-type using a fake gun and a hammer, and pull it off. Once in Florida, all four party it up (and up and up). A few days into their spring break stay, a party goes out of bounds and the girls are arrested for drug use. They don't have the money to bail out, but a local rapper-gangsta called Alien (played by an almost unrecognizable James Franco) decides to put up the bail money. At that point we are about 40 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: I felt the movie started off quite tentatively, if not predictable. The highlight of the first half of the movie is easily the robbery of the fast food/diner, as Korine films it from the outside (riding along in the pickup truck of the girls), and we watch as the girls intimidate/threathen the diner's customers for money. As the girls settle in for spring break and the partying goes on and on, I felt the movie needed a jolt to provide it some direction. As if by magic, that is when James Franco comes in and takes the movie to another level, and correlating, we slide away from the non-stop frat boys parties to the real story of the movie (sorry, don't want to reveal more). What to make of the ""bad girl"" performances of Hudgens and Gomez? Let me just say that Hudgens gets the far better end of that deal, and comes across far more realistic and believable than does Gomez. At one point in the movie, the James Franco character tells her ""you're so pretty, but you look like you're only 15"", and right he is, she does look like she's 15, and not just being ""the shy one"" but also ""the weak/scared one"". If this is Gomez's idea of an ""image change"", she may have misfired badly.The music plays a huge role in the movie. Skrillex and Cliff Martinez scored the original soundtrack, and it sounds great. But there is plenty of other music in the movie. For some reason, Britney Spears gets big ""thumbs up"" (at one point, the 4 girls start singing ""...Baby One More Time"" and later in the movie Britney's ""Everytime"" comes at a key moment). But there are also songs from the Black Keys and Ellie Goulding, just to name those (""Lights"" plays over the end credits). Bottom line, ""Spring Breakers"" is an intruiging, if ultimately flawed movie (mainly because of the first half of the movie), but the second half of the movie has enough interesting elements to it that I can recommend this, warts and all.",0.5625,579,0.05242749577384931,0.0,0.06671429976515535,0.061027387881629196,0.09646364951182401,0.33186172824635735,0.1071574642395057,0.141300033059988,0.09564322024917121,0.0,0.032239950532057776,0.030827981941556247,0.031515905146044854,0.1118728128112858,0.07497416027433873,0.026557871265333755,0.0,0.09631442169216017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05964133877198392,0.14477275430937844,0.09699665092893002,0.0,0.024286924329361793,0.02507895214222827,0.0,0.05139954350928371,0.08503923010780824,0.02644284254710865,0.03192985018440999,0.0,0.05137574281052192,0.031868016419624196,0.09917625560463424,0.13008494272758686,0.06231796716048792,0.10469349222737963,0.10182861621957325,0.0,0.10230646659908597,0.048658060464169914,0.0,0.0,0.029861899361036347,0.10522534606120082,0.0,0.30980533497316814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04193882568671945,0.23188719380831221,0.06003932847298759,0.12823734936317038,0.029549582578346348,0.0,0.09141005974482025,0.07782134942978537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05704578684469856,0.0,0.1018423594990842,0.0,0.023943373014571744,0.05363026876158393,0.028023513694165815,0.029697874691963982,0.08932858101508884,0.6043228361053581,0.03020436482468597,0.0,0.0,0.05092356509212353,0.050275416858295015,0.028097572799913487,0.027170238905192396,0.18831653531831866,0.0,0.0,0.13708513929535332,0.0,0.0,0.030786813432570722,0.0,0.1268190484980035,0.0,0.0,0.026198804762229164,0.02705152082497512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02848931225808695,0.10455018523208959,

We all know the cost (for 2) of seeing a movie, and with drinks and popcorn it's a pretty penny. Trust me stay home, rent a movie at your local vdeo store and bake some brownies.

36974,0780629450,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,210,221,1097452800,Baring Hamlet's Soul,"There is a moment at the start of this film when Hamlet, until then holding himself rigidly erect through sheer force of will, seizes a moment of privacy and literally deflates with exhaustion and despair. In itself, this perfect gesture would mark Branagh's portrayal a masterful work. But what follows raises his performance to the sublime: He embarks on the ""O that this too too sullied flesh would melt, /Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew..."" soliloquy not with Burton's anger, Olivier's melancholy or Gibson's bitterness, but with an exhalation that embodies the emotion most genuine given the circumstances: overwhelming grief. This is a perfect note, and what follows shows an understanding of the play's mental and emotional landscape that puts other portrayals to shame.I have seen many performances of Hamlet, but I have never seen one as perfectly pitched as this. Branagh's Hamlet is strong, resourceful, thoughtful and restrained. Branagh purposely rejects the psychological poses that other actors find so hard to resist. After all, Hamlet and Richard III are the two Shakespearean plays that afford actors the most range. It's hard playing the Dane on a leash when one can go wild with existential abandon and not only dodge the charge of overacting, but actually attribute such excess to the character. There are few meatier roles in the repertoire that simultaneously offer the actor such depth on the one hand and such leeway on the other.For me, such moderation exemplifies Branagh's devotion to Shakespeare. It must have been tempting for a man of his talents to show off. But to forego such gestures, to offer in its stead restraint, is to put service before self.For, of course, Hamlet is restrained. His very life depends on it. His whole course of action is based on it. His safety revolves around it. Hold off the will to strike, restrain the impulse for vengeance, apportion each action in only the most miserly measure. The walls have ears, conspiracies abound and death lurks around every corner. In such an environment, is it plausible that a man of Hamlet's intelligence would show his hand by indulging in excess? A restrained performance feels right because a restrained course of action is the only course possible for our hero.This does not stop Hamlet from making bold gestures. But such gestures must always be made under cover, and here again, Branagh shows his creative mettle. The Player King scene provides a counterpoint. Branagh lets go here and shows his excitement when the occasion demands it. Likewise, his graveyard response to Ophelia's death: the cover of madness conflates with reality because Hamlet's act cannot be sustained forever. Branagh knows exactly when to allow the cracks to show.Those used to earlier works may find Branagh's version overly long and laboured. Many directors have cut out scenes and soliloquies in a misguided attempt to ""tighten up"" the production. Branagh makes what I believe is the right decision: to leave them all in because every scene, every soliloquy adds texture and is indispensable to the whole.The best Hamlet I have seen.",0.9502262443438914,511,0.0,0.0436371522999719,0.05880454314227894,0.0,0.09565510642795151,0.26326409249841365,0.05667161988722901,0.05337740132816309,0.031613851291292454,0.06001049580481986,0.12787888142249348,0.0407594488839664,0.04166899173833178,0.1479134834038687,0.03304255053210646,0.03511368984056455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03279328682234342,0.0,0.11963274327871579,0.032061213437103706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16865288940817816,0.0349616037530103,0.0,0.0,0.3056707166622281,0.0,0.0,0.17199278836125817,0.04119708519756545,0.19774470076363335,0.13463347310878837,0.044319692128637414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08664387708347922,0.03948213551220427,0.0,0.12488070744905777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08317460213932144,0.2299435519521192,0.15876290212974403,0.08477498942831582,0.11720761056575185,0.03517496054241639,0.12085850007025238,0.034297361405600316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1373375703196432,0.031656911255083964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16534904017168844,0.48273520630547156,0.0,0.042064045031172975,0.04315805774072413,0.0673289757434237,0.0,0.1114482535190999,0.0,0.32559462865136335,0.08541028768284217,0.043776040519502867,0.03624963021227395,0.035032384593241324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391684206428352,0.1430654893193394,0.0,0.0,0.07401032317164294,0.12598286812475204,0.11300207735857709,0.0,

So I am writing this as my take on the movie.I felt it was excellent. The filming, special effects, acting and soundtrack all come together to present a superb mystery/though provoking movie.The premise of the film is simple. What if modern religion is/was a lie? What if Jesus WAS indeed a human? Would that not shake the very foundations that so many religions were forged upon? Indeed it would. Countless lives, battles, wars and crusades were carried out. More lives have been lost in the name of religion than for any other cause. Religions were the rock of governments for centuries even!If all of that came into question, it stands to follow that everything would then be questioned. Hence the premise for this film.In order to preserve societies and the world, as well as people's beliefs and lives even, a secret society was formed. To protect the world from the truth. So, if you can bring it into your mind that what we know today as religious history is a lie you can understand how unearthing the truth would shatter lives everywhere.The further mystery is... what exactly is the truth? And what do we do with it when we find it?All in all I would say that would be a most devastating blow to mankind. The way this movie plays it all out, with twists and turns, is done to perfection. It's part cat-and-mouse, part treasure hunt, part murder mystery and a big part of moral and ethical questioning.If you like a really good mystery that provokes much deeper and broader thinking, you will definitely like this movie. Nothing comes close in this realm. And, if you did like this movie you should read 'Another Roadside Attraction' and/or 'Skinny Legs and All', both by Tom Robbins.",0.75,309,0.0,0.0,0.2291437562819333,0.0,0.0,0.2963600194187832,0.0,0.13866386945999648,0.0,0.07794766464322714,0.0,0.05294246964703457,0.0,0.0,0.04291898630883595,0.09121838049732585,0.10687623332559001,0.0,0.0,0.10097992770714541,0.08519043508958583,0.0,0.09323461999482091,0.04164432703869725,0.0,0.04170917696022733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07302110899320431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054728574033996016,0.2554806820638985,0.11170076174541559,0.1070218313710507,0.15411041765325,0.19985770195493796,0.0,0.0,0.12534446273964459,0.0,0.05627088881466628,0.0,0.04517721676126204,0.05406920558423544,0.16626391948069508,0.0,0.05093189113831217,0.04432870031207256,0.0,0.07202368971672402,0.12444741703137134,0.03436953621481006,0.0,0.0,0.045688774795605104,0.10465544631169713,0.0890977216281081,0.05787992915407558,0.0,0.049548524636437816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12335753616387381,0.0,0.0,0.05100167868404324,0.21477195546428218,0.36756638752128407,0.0,0.0,0.05605802395581617,0.0,0.0,0.144760195260417,0.0,0.1492641299417149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04550358282004414,0.1332448676664757,0.0,0.05595998218514346,0.16334462725698326,0.0474839033944977,0.15863455670905707,0.22496273491765298,0.04645695987812267,0.0,0.0,0.048066023895912746,0.06545568553420525,0.29355691572962894,0.21545925459805776,
241226,6300987582,A2ZNJKY01ANDHG,12,12,956880000,Chilling psycho-drama that defies classification. . .,"Although The Incredible Shrinking Man is generally considered a typical early 50-s science fiction B-movie, that gross generalization lasts less than 30 minutes from the moment the film starts.Interestingly, the only  science fiction imagery of this picture is the odd sparkling cloud that  provides the catalyst for the story.  From that point on, TISM is far more  accurately categorized as a horror picture, and it delivers with  devastating effect.True horror resides in finding familiar circumstances  gone inexplicably wrong.  Imagine the pet cat that you played with for  years suddenly large enough to consider you a potential meal.  Now, add the  realization that the cat isn't bigger, you're smaller, and getting smaller  still.  Soon the rat that you want exterminated may exterminate you.  The  spider you tried to ignore isn't ignoring you, and a world once familiar  and mundane is now filled with deadly terrors.Much of the pain of this  film is very personal, as a family finds itself being destroyed by a  phenomenon it is powerless to comprehend, much less overcome.  The most  disturbing realization is that, as our hero shrinks beyond the physical  realities of our world, his loved ones will never have any idea of what has  really happened to him.This film is based on a superb short-story, and  it does an excellent job of staying with the story line.  The ending is  both thought-provoking and nearly infinite in its possibilities.If this  is a &quot;B&quot; movie, &quot;A&quot; doesn't exist.",1.0,241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05233020802846901,0.17282922250150642,0.0,0.1314057115112398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054229939447259685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16146253210002412,0.0,0.07853723540633388,0.10523870798716833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05576709606201381,0.0461326170494615,0.0,0.0,0.07439332488528021,0.05574127295613444,0.0,0.05380175966324986,0.07056929888881806,0.0,0.3245416281654299,0.09469822106026851,0.07273815676310562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057083308345858584,0.06831870920005542,0.08403257449578565,0.0,0.128709161604614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18869343767114286,0.08685470128989632,0.0,0.06412097453516918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42880502677579085,0.06260663920158545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18242846610831503,0.06444276029359172,0.271373374384654,0.46443554828375555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12194038580589238,0.0,0.1257343260647736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574956855506238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056849970335681656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06073343733212189,0.1654120084503504,0.0,0.31761543994726976,

71435,0783242379,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,459,476,1348358400,Astounding Blu Ray Transfers!,"The 'Universal Classic Monsters Essential Collection' takes most of the top tier titles from Universal's classic horror library of the 30's, 40's and 50's and puts them all together in one box set. These films have not just been remastered in 1080p but have also been meticulously cleaned up with much work done to both video and audio.  The end result is an eye opening revelation for all the fans of these films.To call these movies ""classic"" is really somewhat of an understatement for fans. These are basically the gold standard for horror films and Universal has finally given them their due.  I was fortunate enough to borrow a review set for 2 days in anticipation of receiving my own set that was pre-ordered the same day it was announced. One week to go and I can watch them again! I made notes as I watched and spent a great two days and nights with this set.With that said, this review will focus on the video/audio quality of the set and not the films' content. Basically, what everyone is wanting to know is whether or not this upgrade is a major step up from the legacy series DVD sets. Other than containing the more popular top tier titles and only one of the sequels (Bride of Frankenstein) the answer is YES this is a HUGE upgrade. In fact, once you see these transfers on a properly calibrated display you will NEVER want to watch them any other way.  I simply can not imagine them looking any better when first released (other than a few missing frames here and there these days) and the audio is most definitely the best it has EVER sounded.  Major kudos and hats off to the team at Universal that did this fantastic job of restoration.The included booklet is very nice but doesn't contain anything the more than casual fan doesn't already know. Still, it is nice to have and looks great. Unfortunately the US set has the cardboard sleeve design of the new 'Indiana Jones' set and as such is going to receive numerous complaints about disc scratching, etc.  The Box itself looks great and even the discs look really good. It is a shame Universal opted for the slide in/out disc storage system. Spindles and hubs would have been SO MUCH better! Due to time constraints I had no time to view any special features and just watched the films. (ok, I admit to watching both 'Bride"" and 'Dracula' twice!)***** Since writing this review I have received my UK Coffin version set. I am still blown away by the video and audio quality and have now had a chance to check out many of the special features.  Seems almost all the special features from the Legacy sets have been ported over, unfortunately still presented in SD video.  Still, it is a tremendous value and die hard fans will of course be holding on to their legacy sets until the remaining titles are released on Blu. (if ever)The coffin packaging is very nice, but as another reviewer has pointed out, the disc case that holds the gate-fold disc holders , booklet and art cards is a BIT too small and constantly removing it might eventually cause the coffin to split. To solve this I am keeping the ""Swag"" in the coffin and the discs in the inner case just next to the coffin on my shelf. I can't figure out why they wouldn't notice this before producing large production runs but that's just the way it is.  The discs themselves are much better protected in the UK packaging as they sit on hubs instead of those annoying cardboard sleeves so many are worried about.  So basically, the CONTENT is stellar on either set but the packaging on BOTH sets leaves just a bit to be desired overall, albeit for different reasons. *****If you don't know by now, here are the titles that are included in this collection:Frankenstein/Bride of Frankenstein (1931 and 1935)Dracula/Spanish version of Dracula (1931)The Mummy (1932)The Invisible Man (1933)The Wolf Man (1941Phantom of the Opera (1943)and last but not leastCreature From the Black Lagoon 3D+2D (1954)All titles are presented in their original Black and White other than 'Phantom' which was shot in color.  Each film other than 'Creature' (widescreen format) is presented in their original 4:3 aspect ratios and sporting nice healthy bit rates for each film and VERY nicely restored sound presented in DTS HD Master Audio stereo, although each film is actually a mono track with identical sound output on both sides.THE VIDEO QUALITY:So how does the video quality fare you ask?  Absolutely Stupendous! The grain structures are INTACT and for the most part that is a VERY good thing! You will see things as you have never seen them before. You will see things you wished you hadn't seen before such as the crudely painted warped/rippled backdrop during the graveyard and ending scenes in 'Frankenstein'... Various black wires and threads are now clearly visible during effect shots of 'The Invisible Man' , etc. I for one am glad the restorers saw fit to only remove print damage such as scratches and white specks and left the original productions alone as much as possible.Details and fine texture abound. Equipment in Frankenstein's lab reveals every nuance and texture, fabrics and set decorations become crystal clear, even shaving bumps are visible on Colin Clive's face and there is so much more added detail to Jack Pierce's makeup jobs that it would take a 5 page review to document all the new things I noticed and could see clearly for the very first time.  At first I constantly A/B'd the new transfers against the legacy DVD collections to check for any discrepancies but soon realized I was dealing with something that was so much improved it was a useless exercise.  These are flat out gorgeous to look at and some of the best vintage black & white restoration jobs I have seen. If you have watched these films over and over like I have on both VHS and DVD, you will be extremely excited about these new renderings.For those that insist the video quality is no better than the Legacy DVD sets, I suggest perhaps some may have their players connected to a standard video connection or SDTV , or perhaps for some reason just can't appreciate what high end restoration/scanning rendered in 1080p has done for these films. There is NO comparison between the Legacy sets and these transfers and that goes for video AND audio. I have kept my Legacy sets to hold on to the missing titles for each parent film. (ie: Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein and the ever popular Mother-In-Law of Frankenstein, etc.)Rather than go through each and every film in great detail I will just pick out a few moments that stood out for me personally.  I was absolutely floored when I began watching 'Frankenstein' where light and shadow resolved as never before. Each and every scene was vastly improved to the point where I found myself actually cheering out loud as I watched. It truly is eye opening.  I did notice a slight glitch between scenes where the video just stopped for a fraction of a second. This had nothing to do with a layer change and appears to be an encoding/editing error as my DVD's do not display this pause. (occurs at the end of the meeting between Victor, Elizabeth and Dr. Waldman before they show up at the lab)During the early scenes in 'The Mummy"" the detail revealed in Boris's bandages is extraordinary.  You can truly see the extent that makeup man extraordinaire Jack Pierce went to with this makeup, actually achieving the look of an ancient and rotting mummy.  These details were lost to both the VHS and DVD version and only now can you see them perfectly clearly.  With the massive increase in detail comes an increase in involvement while watching the film. I guarantee you will be sucked into the story like never before!'Dracula"" has been so improved that it deifies description. Yes it is a very old film and problematic in certain areas but the picture quality presented here had me almost having to pick my jaw off the floor.  Renfield in 1080P? It just doesn't get any better than this! Bela's eyes actually gave me the creeps and I have seen this movie a good 50 or 60 times over the last 50 some odd years. It is simply outstanding! And YES, Dracula does groan at the end after Van Helsing whacks the stake for those that were wondering. (Renfield screams too which seems to be cut on some earlier DVD versions)'The Invisible Man' stands out for me as one of the best transfers. Maybe I only think that because it is a personal favorite.  Still, I found it to be almost on par with the new Casablanca 4K scan for overall balance and detail. I really enjoyed watching it and I was very happy to see that one of my favorite titles turned out so very well! (ok, maybe not as good as the new Casablanca scan, but pretty darn close)I have only viewed 'The Creature' in 2D and can not comment on the 3D rendering. (vision problem precludes me from evaluating 3D in my reviews)I can definitely say this of the 2D version, it is by far the clearest, most detailed rendering I have ever seen of this movie and unfortunately betrays clearly just how fake the ""Creatures"" suit really is. On the other hand, Julie Adams is even more of a dish than ever before in 1080p so this transfer certainly DOES have it's advantages.  (hard to believe she ended up selling Real Estate in Cabot Cove. Maine!)Another real standout is 'The Wolfman"" with both contrast levels and detail being absolutely fabulous. A tiny amount of EH causes just a smidgen of 'ringing' in the video but it is so little only the most picky would EVER notice it.  And the fog/mist is handled very well in this transfer, something that normally is a sore point with digital. It looks REALLY good. There are many instances of depth in this movie and actually in ALL of them during their respective running times.  When I first put on 'Frankenstein"" and noticed perceived depth I was totally astounded. DEPTH from a movie shot in 1931?  Nothing short of amazing! Universal Monsters on Blu Ray rocks!  I'm here to tell ya!!Yes, there are a few soft shots here and there, but nothing egregious and at least 90% or more of the time the image is flat out brilliant.Noise reduction is either not used or used so judiciously that you can not see it happen. Edge enhancement was not even needed and if used I can not notice it. Picture flickering has all but been eliminated using some very sophisticated digital tools. At times it still fluctuates just a bit on the older titles but shows up mainly on the character faces. It is so small and infrequent that only the truly obsessive (like myself) will even notice it. Still, most annoying defects of the past are now history.Scratches, tears and white specks have been sent packing.  GREAT!THE AUDIO QUALITY:Each and every film is an auditory revelation. Gone are the crackles, pops, hiss and wow and flutter that has plagued each home release before this one. With all these undesirable elements finally removed, the dynamic range seems much greater and the full frequency spectrum, such as it is for these older films is given a chance to really shine through.  Of course there is no LFE or surround activity and the mixes are the original MONO minus the sonic aberrations that started from the very first playback of the original source.  Simply put, the audio on this set is superb considering the source elements.  I highly doubt it could have been done any better by anyone.Bottom Line:  If you are a fan of these films this purchase is a no brainer. You simply can NOT go wrong here folks.  I purchased them all, first on VHS, later on DVD, then remastered versions of the DVD's, the entire legacy collections, etc. This was well worth the wait and almost every film in this collection will see multiple viewings.The only thing really lacking here is the exclusion of all the sequels, especially the Frankenstein and Wolfman series sequels. I also wish the 'Werewolf of London' along with 'The Old Dark House', 'The Black Cat' and a few others could find their way to Blu Ray in the future. But for now, this is what we get and along with the legacy DVD sets (for the sequels and extras) this collection of horror classics on Blu Ray is a real gem. I do think it is just a BIT overpriced but things have a way of coming down in price over time and this will be no exception. However for me, it is a MUST HAVE day of release purchase and I will never regret it.(From what I have seen, the UK packaging is nicer..both for the standard set and the collectible coffin version which is what I have ordered and since received now)Marty G's most HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION for this set!",0.9642857142857143,2218,0.0251041023179972,0.01053579999004802,0.07098915401195872,0.019481352510002305,0.04619013919257525,0.3559514539978084,0.11630427231330089,0.10309996775521248,0.061063052296452085,0.057955989131179386,0.01029173725145004,0.07872803398242509,0.030181815696230227,0.0892809678700924,0.03191131274325182,0.09325674864908823,0.02979940697397866,0.01024859638660044,0.0983741533027607,0.04692564892297829,0.07125881123985241,0.05711668081087475,0.1559749795911651,0.06192714499599135,0.018930236421666816,0.038764737494727045,0.04002890539997199,0.037886378365991784,0.06563168837570278,0.15609230280682995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02034601457527324,0.03957419084943293,0.19205830447408556,0.009946667620077421,0.24349281250711402,0.14859907420317198,0.0,0.10614041218903272,0.023299166028393544,0.0,0.03137908334526323,0.057195650175846706,0.04198795267915927,0.07035310210575417,0.024724255574391268,0.010149462501080484,0.06627092998639439,0.06591893895076473,0.057024912679442846,0.08702097517562328,0.20819179970615634,0.15332752890748363,0.0477590462858123,0.075463277025557,0.05944875652508563,0.058360406980003755,0.09108870148514085,0.0,0.0,0.0644709382220541,0.08194650051210098,0.02264123059649883,0.010836811551453626,0.01105297585308477,0.09171933576054535,0.05136006343465455,0.008945753174031259,0.08532223108005046,0.12546928846330732,0.5506081795774364,0.06749351876934684,0.09140388583491213,0.010420126895299397,0.056895925742795825,0.024073612333781177,0.12557152372852565,0.04336684071418113,0.18034496979197231,0.020621549773298716,0.010569333307985292,0.043760744400129684,0.09304081397950772,0.08049503133682966,0.019655724616721798,0.04160761113431215,0.0101208927439462,0.02647907992144637,0.019658110106185678,0.041816319576358056,0.025906411764429257,0.028607718816086508,0.0,0.10721478204283487,0.08516882166163595,0.027283340519694468,0.11347443969429158,

1431020,B004X181TY,A106016KSI0YQ,1,2,1354838400,As good as you're likely to get for a film adaptation,"Victorian novels just don't often lend themselves well to good film adaptations simply because they're so long; the pleasures of detail they afford are best translated for BBC miniseries rather than for two-hour screenings in a movie theater. That being said, it's been singular that until this there hadn't really been a satisfying adaptation of JANE EYRE since the Robert Stevenson version from the 1940s with Joan Fontaine (who was, admittedly, too pretty and too docile to be a believable Jane Eyre) and Orson Welles. But this one, directed by Cary Juji Fukunaga is pretty good. The moors are shot gorgeously, to make them look like nothing else on earth; the score by Dario Marinelli, is just about perfect (atmospheric and romantic without being intrusive); and the two leads, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, are quite fine--both are attractive, yet neither is so classically pretty that it seems unlikely they would describe one another as plain. Granted, the story is too rushed; but how else are you going to shoehorn in 500 pages worth of plot into a two-hour movie? (Remarkably, they even manage to get the St. John Rivers story into here, which the Stevenson version eschewed.) Its only other failing is that it's probably not scary enough: you don't get the great architectural sense of Gothic space and the looking ""third story"" that you do, say, in the Stevenson version.

It can be easy to see that when watching the ultra glossy, over the top action that is found throughout Hostage, which finds Bruce Willis as a burned out hostage negotiator whose family has been taken hostage, and whose lives depend on that of another family taken hostage as well by a trio of young, would be thieves (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman).  However, things don't go as well as one would hope, and soon enough good 'ol Bruce has to take matters into his own hands.  Willis is pretty good in a role that fits him like a glove, while the glossy action sequences end up being surprisingly tense and bloody to boot.  However, Hostage ends up being way more over the top than it should be thanks to the schizoid screenplay, and the performances from Tucker, Marshall, and Foster in particular who apparently would have been better off in the looney bin.  All in all, Hostage is worth a look for Willis fans or mainstream action junkies, but you can do far, far better.",0.0,200,0.0,0.0,0.14643319181984515,0.0,0.0,0.2622287278914732,0.0,0.26583739384286115,0.0,0.22415432483157566,0.0,0.20299575093903932,0.1037627899836824,0.06138823728753596,0.0822815021039777,0.17487797388324947,0.10244809784142424,0.10570168791632752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0595811259075027,0.07983780786891184,0.0,0.1599242678805572,0.0,0.0,0.16922756981581635,0.06999567149634857,0.0,0.0,0.11287481749860948,0.08457460426410879,0.0,0.0,0.21414546924373992,0.102587663415011,0.14772525803772518,0.09578856199893428,0.0,0.0,0.0801007631791055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08661083533625652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431495189464892,0.06589104984964245,0.07036798873655202,0.0,0.08759156128295578,0.0,0.0854061919921616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09390861491032272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777711667629821,0.23528393675400433,0.3730629615897274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19077301800608346,0.0,0.0,0.18053533861930285,0.0,0.06386210860358915,0.0,0.10728285516280915,0.0,0.18206613124294935,0.0,0.0,0.08906427599314456,0.09835116446611213,0.08348636819490989,0.0,0.0,0.2813941574182974,0.06884408912084726,
1044514,B000MCH5P4,A2XFII4E73279L,4,8,1249689600,"A FEELING MOVIE, NOT A FEEL-GOOD MOVIE","BABEL is one of those films that are not often made anymore, and it takes a non-American director to bring it off. It is good to see in this age of TRANSFORMERS and X-MEN and Bruce Willis action pieces that we can still have movies that are about ideas, not just escapism.The reviewer for Amazon, Sam Graham, is spot-on in his analysis and overview. This is clearly not a film  for everyone -- only for those of us who who care to think and who recognize that lack of communication is a central problem throughout the world. Americans are not the only ones who often fail to see what is going on under their noses, and who can realize that small issues can quickly escalate into monumental ones. A mistake, such as taking the children of an American couple across the border into Mexico, quickly grows into a life-threatening event, and the parents of the children, who we don't realize until later, are Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette -- tourists in North Africa who must resort to some difficult-to-watch crude surgery. That those top-billed stars in what is an ensemble piece are not given the full-focus of the long film is not the point. This is not a pretty-boy movie, or even a pretty movie. It is gritty and real, and all of the characters are shown as having clay feet.If we think that we are really in charge of our lives, we need to think again. At any moment, something can happen which can throw what we think are our self-absorbed and ordered existences into a tail spin -- often because of our own short-sighted perspectives and often because of someone's else's -- wherever they happen to be in the world. The rifle fired carelessly by the boy is the center piece -- the center of the spider web, but the rest of the web strands may seem to be unconnected to the rest until near the end. The story in Japan seems to be unrelated to the other stories until we discover that the rifle used by the boys halfway around the world is one that the father of the deaf-mute originally furnished. Dismiss this as the butterfly effect if you wish, but the connections exist if we are careful enough to look.The story about the deaf-mute girl in Japan (portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi who was, as she should have been, nominated for an Academy Award) is not as separate as we might first think. In fact, it is her inability to communicate with her father and her friends in an area of the world where personal defects are looked down upon by peers that turns out to be a microcosm for the entire, far-flung story. Her frustration is the distillation of what is wrong with all of us -- we don't take to listen to, or understand, others around us. As a professor who has taught in China for many years and has learned how personal ailments and birth defects are sometimes looked down upon as reflecting weaknesses in character, I understood the Japanese girl's painful frustration. Boys ignore her because she cannot speak to them, and even her father, until the very end in a touching finale, is unable to comprehend her needs and angst. She wants and needs to be recognized as a human being, even if it means only being a sexual being. She, like most of us, needs to be understood for who we are and not expected to be exactly like everyone else.For obvious reasons, I did not show the film in class to Chinese students, but I did loan it to a former female student. She asked me in an Instant Message why the girl showed, as she put it, her beaver to the boys in public. I told her that she felt that since she could not be noticed as a teenage girl wanting to fit in with the others, she would show herself as a sexual object, which is what, she felt, the boys only cared about. She would get attention in the only way she knew how, even if it meant making sexual overtures to a mature dentist or to a police officer who comes to her home in her father's absence. Of course, she is reeling from the death of her mother and even makes up her own version to explain her untimely demise, but her issues are even deeper and more inward-focused than that.Even the Brad Pitt character learns that some people, even in a third-world nation, are not interested in helping others for a reward. When he offers money to the man who has helped save his wife's life, he is amazed when his money is rejected. Even in these days of constant terror threats, some people -- in any corner of the globe -- are still human and, more importantly, humane. This humble native of Morocco is not like Pitt's fellow tourists who want to get on with their trip; he is selfless and resourceful, willing to help an American tourist whose wife's life is threatened.That this film ends with the deaf-mute girl standing nude on the terrace with her father is perfect because it exemplifies the theme of the entire, skillfully woven tapestry. If we don't communicate with others and reconcile our differences -- whether real or perceived -- we are doomed to live in isolation.When BABEL was overlooked for an Academy Award in favor of the Martin Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, an American remake of a Japanese film, I was disappointed but not surprised. After all, that gangster film, full of violence and vile language, was more accessible to the American public. It was easier to accept a film full of pretty boys and the scene-stealing Jack Nicholson, people who settle their differences by shooting each other, than a film where one single shot fired in stupidity can affect us so dramatically. It's like that uncanny Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game. See if you think we are all really unconnected from each other.",0.5,1012,0.0444167583741693,0.018641020360287967,0.05024052341716899,0.0,0.10896578977665353,0.19493373160736613,0.2057774739676732,0.13681129576434678,0.013504878630415993,0.10254169350361966,0.0728367978998204,0.017411716312217364,0.0,0.052655021970319404,0.07057596849935109,0.08999968688285216,0.0,0.05439861066671267,0.0,0.14944622715642097,0.12607841382967935,0.016842783824567973,0.10220998785097535,0.027391967667742295,0.033493320193500334,0.013717311672260242,0.0,0.0,0.04354587360880989,0.0240151780426887,0.04480493797405324,0.2885448651716616,0.0,0.04352570957330838,0.035998260436477365,0.09802621702084668,0.23878490981222153,0.0703946672480578,0.21118260466072591,0.09859378394466296,0.0,0.014445732911626177,0.05496437273844316,0.0,0.018506366612842242,0.01686607061091661,0.04457364119582807,0.017782277161156164,0.02187234723469206,0.01795747236159883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16581002794679897,0.2373839034406837,0.0452138042176333,0.03621437744409023,0.08344836680746963,0.06010448629975627,0.05162861556676076,0.014651226731547326,0.05710664311587049,0.0,0.032591031752403014,0.04832939077378531,0.0,0.24925681244014317,0.039112122119582,0.013523273086044835,0.04543575186959835,0.04748323825796185,0.03354685818828872,0.17154017113839853,0.39109921519278634,0.05117848771760376,0.017969016733080226,0.0,0.0,0.014197836521940566,0.04760872452644931,0.0,0.2945398698015587,0.0,0.0,0.01548520146765727,0.01496521564887887,0.0547769553284706,0.01738846424204255,0.018404115658760763,0.25069693334664833,0.0,0.0,0.07398573106470352,0.045836286719460446,0.033743811222421864,0.2005063981006269,0.0,0.0753447170673299,0.032181660408935955,0.023620075671538097,

And the directors seem to be unable to decide if they want to make a live action movie, or an animated movie, so what you get is a weird combination  of both.  It was ridiculous how the characters in the movie were so hard to kill, especially Marv (Mickey Rourke).  And the movie had cannibalism in it, and people being hacked up with saws.  And Nick Stahl's character had his sex organs shot off, then surgically replaced, then ripped off again.

The two attempt suicide, but only Fleur dies, leaving her ghost to search for her lover for more than fifty years.  Fleur's ghost puts an ad in the newspaper in the 1980's and enlists the help of a reporter and his girlfriend.The atmosphere in ""Rouge"" is outstanding and Kwan skillfully employs the right camera shots to supply specific moments in the film with a certain element of spookiness.  The scene with Fleur's ghost on the tram with the reporter is unforgettably creepy.Anita Mui is splendidly enchanting throughout the whole film.  With or without makeup, every shot of her is exquisite.  Leslie Cheung also gives a fine performance.  Fans of these two late (both died in 2003) and extraordinary actors should definitely watch the two of them together in this film.",1.0,159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355825477511583,0.07394197106281075,0.20350472270978068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05716900497040522,0.07662626930826992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2281446668389524,0.0,0.11097219381602741,0.07435053092509607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3916013661641333,0.10511689678246826,0.07876176585586013,0.0,0.0,0.34899757492505634,0.0,0.1834294078512401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065804614387782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26662161748777063,0.06136233784846351,0.0,0.09060218604556951,0.08157136649642098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592309534788234,0.09105686555352713,0.0,0.5018321102633515,0.0,0.09754727739984707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04307508425029599,0.0,0.0888305650765392,0.0,0.3045522772375998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09439566839810529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2337252306664497,0.0,0.0,

Professor Dr. Abel (he uses both titles) experiments transplanting organs. He can keep organs alive with his &#34;Z serum&#34; and has kept a dog's ahead alive. He has a bad heart. When he dies undergoing a transplant,the evil Dr. Ood, removes his head and keeps it alive in the serum (see cover). But Ood doesn't stop there...(see cover).This is an interesting German sci-fi horror.

One of my friends was an usherette in a Japanese ""art house"" theatre & I got to see all the latest releases for free. I particularly enjoyed the Asian ghost/vampire genre. They are very different from western presentations in that the esthetic value is much more pronounced--in other words they are beautiful as well as frightening. If you weren't previously aware of the fact, you wouldn't know that UGETSU was a ghost story until near the end. I debated even mentioning the fact, but since other reviews spill the beans, what the heck. It is a ghost story and a parable. It's set during the samurai era & you learn a lot about the culture while at the same time being entertained & captivated. Asian black & white films (as UGETSU is) can be extraordinarily beautiful because Asian art has a flair for natural lighting effects. If I could have given UGETSU 4 1/2 stars I would have. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I have seen so many Japanese films that I had to hold back at some point--nonetheless, UGETSU is a great film with plenty of heart, soul & suspense.",1.0,215,0.08188086080486544,0.0,0.06946258780352292,0.0,0.07532809398791417,0.04146392815589097,0.13388616464071254,0.2522072090593726,0.14937484784573157,0.0708871136689133,0.20140842990161759,0.0,0.0,0.05824070034524876,0.0,0.08295575931112864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09183309912386244,0.07747382918192881,0.0,0.11305248867003867,0.07574431275059462,0.0,0.0,0.07833623022345262,0.18535830722548588,0.08027541284198704,0.19922042605600293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15489271536714067,0.25395708232547687,0.0,0.18686799223986517,0.13631584442843037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10234766903956562,0.0,0.08217006922423507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09263689356235155,0.08062675468725841,0.0,0.0,0.18107982041095305,0.0,0.06676003623800851,0.09230062287836058,0.0,0.19035137364856872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08909367237915353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747891526790419,0.08375934243239483,0.17506763504044884,0.0,0.1674152312643776,0.47191338527584276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15703952092001255,0.0,0.08486854147783589,0.09049579094126342,0.0,0.0,0.08563940766865495,0.08276367643523887,0.12117545949971548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636556009152811,0.0,0.08183418468978036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190533325655708,0.08898877876956782,0.195942812932484,
756666,B00009Q4W4,AK61LQI92GTCH,9,9,1126828800,Tempest,"John Barrymore may not have been the greatest actor ever, but if you want to argue that he was you could do worse that enter as evidence the late-silent era film TEMPEST (1928).  This is a film that has it all - romance across class lines (a peasant loves a princess,) set against a romantic yet contemporary (circa 1928) backdrop of the Russian Revolution.Barrymore plays Ivan Markov, to the peasantry born, who we meet while still a sergeant in the Russian Army, studying diligently to become an officer and a gentleman by promotion to first lieutenant. It certainly helps that to the company commander he is a surrogate son.  Unfortunately, he's attentively shunned by his fellow officers (upstart peasant!) while the commander's daughter, Princess Tamara (Camilla Horn), doesn't bother to disguise the fact that Ivan should go back to whatever stable he was born in.  The Princess's beneath-contempt attitude is complicated by the fact that Ivan has fallen madly in love with Tamara at first sight.  For her part, Princess Tamara's attitude of disgust and loathing is at violent odds with some tender emotions of her own she does her best to conceal.Although a silent movie, this one reads as though it had spoken dialogue.  Barrymore's performance is intensely subtle.  One of the biggest differences between silent and sound movies is the acting styles.  Most silent acting seems broad and phony.  You can adjust and enjoy - hey, they had to sell the scenes somehow, didn't they?  They couldn't talk their way out of them.  But rather than the expressionistic silent style of acting, Barrymore's is more a modern, sound, naturalistic style.  Not only does it work, but Barrymore is so strong (yeah, probably the greatest ever) that TEMPEST doesn't really need the inter-title dialogue cards to convey the rather familiar rich snob girl meets humble boy story.  Horn, who has her own range of emotions to broadcast, doesn't embarrass herself, either.Silent or sound. TEMPEST is a great movie.  Good thing, too, because the Image transfer print was in pretty rough shape.  The frames are consistently scratchy.  The original tasteful pipe organ score is included, here rendered on piano.  Also on the dvd is the 13-minute short `Vagabonding On the Pacific,' a travelogue silent short from 1926.  `Vagabonding' takes us along with Barrymore as he yachts down to Mexico.  The high point of this kind of boring film is Barrymore playing tag with some 1,100 pound sea lions.  A somewhat strange look at Barrymore at play.",1.0,416,0.0,0.0,0.03847267588224448,0.0527897374815038,0.04172135586168428,0.1148264352933709,0.03707721796881942,0.10476595944804339,0.1654660526723697,0.0,0.05577622061442763,0.053333466506410424,0.05452359725370135,0.09677190233146075,0.1297078697340068,0.04594602852358276,0.053832774031924435,0.0,0.05331401631536241,0.0,0.12872939003813877,0.10318156244620227,0.031307729036715526,0.04195188354657284,0.0,0.04201721240525524,0.04338744769700224,0.10266289093833528,0.13338446078277977,0.03678019647283441,0.2287351244713539,0.22095894549222847,0.0,0.044440898914848086,0.0,0.04289458126507145,0.11252570714980502,0.0,0.310497143521861,0.10066685710286732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05226686786114142,0.0,0.0,0.045510864775545494,0.05446852374436905,0.06699673241514417,0.055005160523153254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07255560741281278,0.22565970091957466,0.10387009828447465,0.07395167146195882,0.05112179174453888,0.04602620082753961,0.0,0.0448778682212112,0.0,0.0,0.04991445613998715,0.0,0.0,0.05873025875837377,0.0,0.041422856842983115,0.09278220508070446,0.048481640213529874,0.05137834218918961,0.2163581141876739,0.522749620776134,0.052254587497123375,0.055040521847602844,0.0,0.0,0.13046729426812778,0.07291464751130408,0.0,0.30073298536804643,0.05587939535693327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10067169232309013,0.0,0.05637326432764633,0.054850326306354925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08773814035550367,0.0,0.13187819289001404,0.0,0.10852524462131241,

1471602,B005LAIHPE,A16XRPF40679KG,0,1,1360972800,fun b film on a A budget.,"This movie is easy to attack on many levels. Items like the fact that the aliens often just let the warships sit there and don't finish them off for long periods of time. BUT it's still a fun romp in which the navy saves the world! And in this day of endless antimilitary movies it's refreshing to see and promilitary movie!.  This one borrows from all the recent alien invasion flicks in many ways but it differs in that it's the Navy that's that's doing hte fighting. The part that probably drove some people mad was they way they used bouys to simulate radar and you had red strikes similiar to the GAME battleship. Still this movie runs very quickly and is full of action. the aliens are very humanoid in this flick and that may not be to some peoples liking. The blu ray looks great and this movie had a monster budget, which it didn't make back unfortunately for it's studio. Still The huge budget shows here and the film is a good way to spend a few mindless hours of entertainment. There is a made for dvd film called 'american battleship"" that is also promilitary and actually features more fighting with a battleship against aliens!. That one is low budget but still worth watching if you enjoyed this film. Sure this is not great cinema , but it's fun cinema , and cinema that is very familiar to fans of modern sci fi.",0.0,246,0.0,0.0,0.04953689944919174,0.06797135519178558,0.0,0.2956979439978061,0.04774012662906102,0.0,0.0,0.05055279299401929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.166136264604111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715156696490357,0.06864640955908993,0.0,0.16575022933141095,0.0,0.12093423109075196,0.05401668039185895,0.0,0.054100796950675545,0.1117301869254891,0.132187356063858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05523048528120901,0.18110823177435992,0.0,0.26652796086554853,0.22683025710271826,0.0,0.05697367543496258,0.05419459074946039,0.0,0.14597746356391814,0.0,0.05859917670224801,0.0,0.17252818115545043,0.07082390407056685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09342162317704257,0.16142021805585793,0.04458057999608616,0.09521917644936631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07507581119785926,0.0,0.0,0.06353670990042679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11946511799243759,0.0,0.0,0.35817402171357254,0.3645879104451406,0.0,0.07086943483580427,0.0,0.11343574911718267,0.11199195427857879,0.250357115662803,0.060523578785728664,0.22587818325878434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17706751420841546,0.04320783851247891,0.0,0.1451709122166944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13308490197666903,0.0,0.0,0.04245114637157788,0.0,0.09315709582145233,
1252349,B00274SIVK,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,3,4,1251244800,Finally,"Us Lucy fans have been waiting for a true release of this classic series in remastered glory forever.  And here it is !!  And the wait was certainly worth it.  Episodes of the series have been released in collections over the years with a disgraceful lack of remastering that left them unwatchable.  Here we have quality packaging, superb extras and more importantly all 30 episodes from Season one.  Huge kudos must be given for the tender care that was given to the packaging.  It is presented as if it is a huge gift for Lucy fans.  You can watch each episode either in its remastered glory or start it with its original airing video which includes cast members in promos for products sponsoring the show.  Great fun and as a huge Lucille Ball fan there is no Lucy memorabalia I do not want.Now to my thoughts on the actual 1st season of THE LUCY SHOW.  I think it is amazing how Lucille Ball carried the character of Lucy onto a new series yet made her very different from Lucy Ricardo.  The Lucy character seems to be a kind hearted loving woman who gets into wacky troubles and dilemmas doing the best she can.  The character is also a natural stage for Lucille Ball to perform her comedic antics with the timing and broad range that only she has ever possessed.  When watching the first episode the viewer will be very comfortable knowing they are watching Lucy and quietly be moved onto a new Lucille Ball stage where Lucy Ricardo becomes a memory and Lucy Carmichael becomes a reality.  She is very believable as a widowed mother.  Vivian Vance's presence is a huge bonus and again Lucy and Vivian are together and just as hilarious as Lucy and Ethel but the cameraderie and relationship of Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Bagley is in no way Lucy and Ethel.  It is easy to forget the great acting they are both doing for you seamlessly accept the new characters.  And the antics are just as hilarious as with I LOVE LUICY.  There are classic episodes here such as Lucy and Viv attaching the antenna.My favorite episode early on is Lucy is a kangaroo for a day.  She gets a job to earn money for Jerry's birthday present.  She gets a job as a secretary and center stage becomes Lucy and her comedic talents.  I was in awe , laughing hysterically at the talent of this great woman.  No performer since Lucille Ball has had the same comedic presence, gifts or aptitude to make even mere dialogue hilarious by her inflection.  To watch her use her great gifts over 30 episodes is an amazing gift.  I wait in great anticipation for the future seasons.  I highly recommend this dvd set to all Lucy fans but also to lovers of classic television.  This show is one for the history books.Purchase, watch and enjoy over and over.",0.75,490,0.0,0.0,0.059320718065797744,0.0813960833785672,0.0321649161598349,0.3718049634060599,0.14292268105579925,0.24230672032011047,0.031891351572740693,0.12107451269583985,0.0,0.08223445490981705,0.04203475410080093,0.049737279798837124,0.03333259165958379,0.07084382205783672,0.04150216663927674,0.0,0.04110223240617555,0.03921251391931885,0.0,0.03977371105010973,0.2413657127920892,0.06468528115414887,0.0,0.0,0.1672469157270289,0.0395737771646873,0.06855481898089491,0.0850666459507926,0.0,0.2555211525274293,0.0,0.0,0.04250438715536307,0.03306940969694914,0.1518146943623472,0.04155870525555314,0.2792726517825745,0.1358152597356627,0.08941744365447227,0.06822629949046652,0.0,0.04029493740002616,0.0,0.0,0.035086423238976414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06885486323791298,0.11912942247537243,0.02796823091147745,0.15464130136335985,0.05338549740825007,0.057012751942657855,0.03941214544548725,0.07096743910631723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14189780913412828,0.22638931669324716,0.13854309298962603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07148590376336937,0.40301177604564675,0.0,0.042433275095154994,0.0,0.06791997649009855,0.06705550023585176,0.07495101651059113,0.0,0.193207432602151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601967629950679,0.07761244754307386,0.12318695523943275,0.04346074769876272,0.042286644586345665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03608032263903509,0.039842481245064704,0.033820688113666154,0.03732998574787892,0.10167097712932749,0.0,0.05577807531859006,

The power of his performance reminds me of Morgan Freeman's pivotal role in ""Street Smart""Street Smart, a film that paved the way for his remarkable career.Edward Zwick's film has stood the test of time and will be watched and remembered long after the other Academy Award films of 1989 ""Fourth of July"",""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Dead Poets Society"", or ""My Left Foot"" become footnotes. The blu-ray transfer is outstanding with commendable video and audio presence, and James Horner's heart-tugging score is given the promience it deserves (although I could have done without the paraphrases from ""Carmina Burana"" during the final battle sequence).

The story is severely flawed, and some of Argento's murder sequences are a bit lame.  This film probably deserves 3 stars, but after viewing the film I realized that it wasn't really that bad.  After all, it features a great score by Keith Emerson, has some very eye-catching parts (mainly the under water room and the alchemist in the library). It also features the wonderful Daria Nicolodi (also in Deep Red and Tenebre).I suggest first time viewers try renting this film first, as you may find yourself highly disappointed.  Although, for Argento fans it's a must, and over time you will probably find yourself appreciating the over all artistic expression that was put into the film.",0.25,134,0.0,0.2367675947046419,0.15953160900363902,0.21889903850412126,0.0,0.1904566870739329,0.07687258689840996,0.07240412273684087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06687940177133098,0.08964156458484654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35586133531406816,0.21392742120322453,0.0649106446710953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995565271895241,0.0,0.09218246957871094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11665036746355766,0.11176410761199074,0.10729283350926815,0.20871365610380474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10396947487027047,0.07178498993851654,0.07666239003588199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35440527772865943,0.10348816813426659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08588244578976986,0.19236632394293016,0.10051749576859342,0.0,0.19224752532159434,0.4064333624257329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15117470738212802,0.19491377162692705,0.051959405751452935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503981125866276,0.06957456033895587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10714865475283598,0.0,0.10039178358961341,0.0,0.0,0.15000435586148653,

It was all Kubrick and no Spielberg.I thought that was the worst, that is until ""The Terminal."" Somehow he forgot that a comedy is there to amuse us, make us laugh and take us away from reality. Instead we get a copy of the type of thing the French are famous for, a movie with no point, a few chuckles and a really lousy ending.Comedies have happy endings, what happened to them. We go to the movies to get away from reality where the government is owned by big money and we have a coke head re-elected by a populace too stupid to see beyond the lies of a party which happens to control the press. We go to the movies to see happy endings not pictures where this slob goes home happy with an autograph while the woman he loves goes off with the married politician who treats her like trash, of course that's what she is, but then so is the whole movie.",0.36363636363636365,261,0.0,0.0,0.04520628419227161,0.0,0.049023558323392724,0.26984743575131737,0.04356658886133777,0.0,0.0,0.046133366282737766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07580614931339247,0.10160649840797395,0.0,0.06325475486015353,0.0,0.0,0.05976502328120615,0.0,0.0,0.14714922357678523,0.09858886737237343,0.12054878796845502,0.0,0.0,0.12063127186587097,0.0,0.08643516346446227,0.32252287540141017,0.06490796815978839,0.06969254736003648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15201721946223898,0.0591429429663774,0.0,0.0,0.04945679076294983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05347631896404829,0.0,0.07872271049673324,0.12926467221890156,0.0,0.0,0.18156889207273127,0.04262725860927498,0.1767702460093464,0.04068325614174572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05865064069037913,0.11596440618357978,0.0,0.06900941271262058,0.0,0.04867281507091346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14527187966869828,0.3839018110954028,0.0,0.06467388648373136,0.3317797093828475,0.15527845209854732,0.05110069633605143,0.028558799213448626,0.05523248595175517,0.26502616124524114,0.06565958226377616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1971526123806251,0.0,0.0,0.32225201161381434,0.0,0.06259196383672162,0.10651545030809896,0.0,0.06072517625602093,0.05154717233020446,0.0,0.11621994564655266,0.0,0.0425065576878769,

For one it stars Charlton Heston, one of the best actors I've ever had the fortune to watch. He doesn't disappoint in anything I've seen, and this movie is one of the reasons he was known for what he did. He plays Moses with a conviction. Another reason this movie is a classic is because of Yul Brynner. He is Rameses. Whenever I think of him, that's whose face comes into my head. He played him just that well. Another reason this movie is a classic...well...De Mille of course. He directed this movie so well I don't think anyone could top it. His direction pulled this movie together and turned a well known story into a beloved story.You really can't beat this version right here. The special effects were pretty good, considering this was made before computers were common place. The sets were gorgeous, as were the costumes.

Eventually, the quality of the tape was so bad I canned it.

936752,B000B6N6EA,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,1,1,1341619200,A marvellous production of a spectacular ballet,"This ballet is a good example of recycled music used to a totally worthwhile end. Initially a large amount of this music was used in the Fiery Angel opera and later surfaced in the 3rd symphony, a symphony I have always liked - not least for its unusual sound world. All became clear when I saw the opera years later and realised that the symphony was really recycled opera music based on rather a strange tale. Prokofiev also made use of the same material for the Ivan the Terrible film (did this precede or succeed the Fiery Angel?) and now we came across a ballet drawing yet again upon much of the same material.This performance of the ballet, which was created by Grigorovich in 1975, was recorded in 2003 and features the Paris Opera ballet. It is totally engrossing and is a spectacular production featuring over 80 dancers. Grigorovich, as a choreographer, is well able to handle such epic productions as his Spartacus ballet has also shown.The ballet charts the unsettled period of history between the point where Ivan is crowned Tsar and the point where he finally crushes the Boyars and from then rules Russia with an iron hand and considerable personal instability - the beginning of Ivan the Terrible. This period crucially features the marriage of Anastasia to Ivan and her poisoning by the Boyars and the repercussions upon them.Ivan is, at best, an unstable character and this is wonderfully portrayed by the, at times chilling and perfectly cast, male lead - Nicolas Le Riche. The two supporting roles of Anastasia (Eleonora Abbagnato) and the treacherous Kurbsky (Karl Paquette) are also excellently portrayed and danced. The considerable corps de ballet are also universally excellent and the whole production is completely impressive.There is none of the lyrical music found in the other great Prokofiev ballets, Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella, as that would be inappropriate to the subject matter. Instead we get music entirely appropriate to the scenarios painted - dramatic, powerful and mysterious as appropriate. As mentioned in the opening paragraph above, you also get yet another opportunity to enjoy the music from the 3rd symphony - or was it the Fiery Angel - or perhaps the film? Great stuff, whatever order it was written in - just enjoy it!The camera work is perfect, giving a good balance between close views for personal impact and the important panoramic views to emphasise the scale when large numbers of the corps de ballet are on stage. The sound is presented in DD 5.0, DTS 5.0 and stereo and clearly demonstrates the excellence of the Paris orchestra under the conductor, Vello Pahn.In summary I have no doubt that this very important release is fully worthy of 5 stars and that it will be a very satisfying addition to the collections of purchasers.",1.0,471,0.0,0.0,0.027904564882155404,0.19144426802717046,0.06052172119128117,0.3497953518824213,0.08067728153046633,0.12664609560852813,0.060006980236084834,0.05695365304494442,0.0,0.0,0.03954643710853986,0.0,0.09407824082205736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224569401851492,0.0,0.06812330072064139,0.06085612864241844,0.07441136858370738,0.060950895815950104,0.06293858285489712,0.0,0.03224830137954391,0.05335398982883305,0.03318071319590479,0.04006585901155169,0.0,0.032233368715665775,0.0,0.0,0.1836357064891057,0.0,0.2252062662251248,0.09126817868438283,0.04206211488008463,0.03209376526240616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03721416504383184,0.0,0.03735911957045107,0.026312605091623194,0.2546023427934506,0.050225254338367886,0.0,0.0,0.13353280766872055,0.0382340510506758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03620338715661267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967223615474429,0.6951171800556614,0.0,0.039921366991604305,0.040959652369035426,0.03194967041127534,0.0,0.12339979184156355,0.0,0.14541615852407871,0.0,0.0415461560514044,0.0,0.06649577713704784,0.14603609994918645,0.0,0.0,0.07956683303796146,0.0346948400767112,0.0,0.0,0.06788897618759906,0.03748393948083327,0.0,0.03512017532209269,0.02391309874899526,0.03574864152747904,0.02623809981536197,

1050814,B000MTFFO0,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,11,13,1186099200,Vignettes Reveal The Whole Truth,"Several seemingly unrelated individual vignettes culminate to form THE DEAD GIRL, including a piece on the victim herself.The first story surrounds the mundane and abusive life of Arden (Toni Collette,Little Miss Sunshine). Mrs. Collette gives a stunningly fine dramatic performance, moving fully away from her recent comedic roles. She is the discoverer of the dead girl's body, but she doesn't report it right away. Found not far from her shabby home where she lives with her scornful mother, Arden takes a few mementoes away from the dead girl's final resting place before notifying the police. Her mother is livid about Arden's find and just wished that she'd left the dead girl alone without telling anyone about her. There is an unseen tie between Arden and her mother (played by Piper Laurie), but the death of an infant (probably Arden's) is quickly surmised. This ""other death"" eats at Arden and her mother's relationship, feeding guilt to one and anger to the other. Arden's celebrity status (""That's the one who found the dead girl"") also peaks the love interest of Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi,10th and Wolf), a town local who soon learns how mentally damaged Arden really is.The effect of the dead girl is then transferred to the medical examiner's office where we meet Leah (Rose Byrne,28 Weeks Later). Leah (an M.E. herself), along with her mother and father, have yet to come to grips with the disappearance of Leah's sister some 15 years earlier. Leah believes the dead girl to be her long, lost sibling while her mother and father (especially her mother) refuse to believe it. The family tension is palpable here and much credit must go to director Karen Moncrieff for ""keeping it real.""We then run into Carl (a distant husband played by Nick Searcy) and his wife Ruth (Mary Beth Hurt,Lady in the Water). Ruth is terribly embittered because of Carl's absences, and she believes her strong religious philosophies are being tested when she finds some disturbing clues as to Carl's activities while he's away. It is Carl whom you want to keep a close eye on throughout the film.The discovery as to the dead girl's true identity is finally meted out and her mother, Melora (Marcia Gay Harden) comes to I.D. the body and discover why her daughter ran away from home. Guilt, shame, fear, and redemption await those who stick it out and finish watching what happens to Melora as she learns the truth behind her daughter's roughshod life and what lay beyond her final resting place.And then we get to meet Krista (Brittany Murphy,Happy Feet), The Dead Girl herself. Interlocking all the other storylines with Krista is a pretty phenomenal piece of cinematic work, and it is done effortlessly. The connections are made in whiplash quick fashion so watching the final segment may take a few viewings before all watchers actually ""get it."" Krista's prostitute life is not relegated to ""the hooker with a heart of gold"" cliche. She is not the best person to hang around with, but she is a ""real"" human being who makes poor decisions, good ones, and one, final, fatal choice.The Dead Girl is not a thriller. It doesn't show the murder nor have men with chainsaws jumping out from behind trees to cut-up our nearly naked victim. It is a slow immersion into the terrible lives of these messed up folks. Don't get me wrong: this film isn't without tension. It has PLENTY. It's just not the type your sixteen-year-old will be used to and will probably fall asleep watching.The ensemble cast, I think, speaks to how motivated the actors were to do this project and make it an effective piece of cinema. All of the cast were spot-on in their character portrayals and it is these characters that drive the entire production.",0.8461538461538461,633,0.04971728552884272,0.0,0.06326554113109996,0.028936305497770917,0.09147701478287565,0.276941562229704,0.04064720748153407,0.057426688462276186,0.022674749288701855,0.04304198607525477,0.030573324214306544,0.0,0.02988670795196351,0.05304480497643554,0.04739894182909251,0.0,0.029508038294867846,0.03044516707079352,0.0,0.0,0.047041377540352695,0.028279106461996977,0.01716110090839624,0.11497807873508298,0.08435314292903516,0.02303142527937725,0.0,0.0,0.024371236342532708,0.04032158719405911,0.02507589450352087,0.48446806930749675,0.0,0.024359951175096616,0.060441234058049145,0.0,0.0462601027270733,0.059096474496125664,0.2552950809126997,0.17933433610768224,0.0,0.04850889534467189,0.0,0.02864969836933785,0.0,0.028318205076404784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02812412352821022,0.0,0.0,0.09942705352574882,0.16492493568804714,0.05693562876868146,0.06080409544309035,0.0,0.0,0.08668466752914535,0.07379841803869563,0.0,0.0,0.027360241223548725,0.0,0.0,0.2897330260435168,0.03283471060647711,0.022705633658795105,0.05085788183570292,0.026574853734464016,0.0,0.05082647381104298,0.47756891924060163,0.028642966978317495,0.0,0.09286418127687383,0.024145549853771184,0.0,0.03996762659387398,0.0,0.2884779962507307,0.0,0.0,0.05199943969483136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09019740622176099,0.0,0.05839769895332995,0.049688944232497624,0.02565310749623043,0.0,0.09618602987077539,0.053083235801613005,0.12650410392301736,0.0,0.019829104307018675,

1664897,B00E688720,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,67,76,1384128000,Same as previous release for the most part. Still the best transfer available.,"I love this show. Farscape is a big mix of a lot of the things a science fiction fan like me love to see. You get the visceral stuff like cool sets and special effects that move from neat to full on spectacle. You get the science stuff like explanations and effects of alien physiology and various advanced and imaginative technologies. You get the story driven stuff with scripts going from drama to action to comedy (sometimes all in one episode), dealing with complexities of alien cultures and governments, to straight up space opera type fair complete with villains in black and scary monsters to fight. There is a reason why Farscape was considered by critics and viewers alike to be one of the best science fiction television shows ever made.You have a modern day Earthling astronaut who is the main character in the series. His is a fish out of water kind of story as he is thrust into this alien part of the galaxy by a wormhole with absolutely no clue regarding his new surroundings. This isn't your normal fish out of water character. This is an intelligent, wise cracking fish who not only takes his new challenges with relative stride, but also with a note of sarcasm. The supporting cast is just as interesting... and interestingly enough all escaped convicts. There is the human female looking plant organism of mediation and empathy (convicted of murder). There is the aggressive tentacle-headed alien with a warrior's rage (also convicted of murder, but is innocent). A blue pixie-like skinned party girl who plays thief and spy at times (convicted of non-conformity). A froggish-like alien with a superiority complex (imprisoned after a coup against him). And last, but certainly not least the tough as nails female Peacekeeper soldier who is a strictly by the book type (ironically on the run for being socially exposed to said convicts). The cast changes a bit later on, but this is pretty much the core group and shows a taste of the interesting developments based on characters alone.The series has varying story arcs much like what you have seen on Deep Space Nine, Babylon 5 and other such shows. What seems to be the main premise of the show slowly morphs into something else. This is done in a way flows smooth and feels organic. What surprises they do pop up on you make sense and aren't just to shake things up. Most episodes have a good mix of the things I mentioned earlier, but sometimes they go off on tangents. Especially on the third season. One example is an episode done entirely animated and ran like an old Warner Brothers cartoon. Even in the odd episodes the show is pretty good.So good characters and good stories are nice, but science fiction for many lives of dies by the visuals. This is where Farscape shines. Sets are intricate and the CGI scenes are dynamic. Special effects can be found all over the place from laser blasts to animatronics to computer generated space battles. As a matter of fact Farscape has the distinction of being the television series with more special effects on average per episode than any other science fiction show to date. So you want flash and style in your substance? We got you covered.I think it's fair to warn you the series ended on a cliffhanger, but was finally concluded with the made for TV movie The Peacekeeper Wars (which creator Brian Henson refers to as episodes 4:23-4:26). Sadly you will have to get this separately on DVD (there is an import Blu-Ray out there too).Aside from two minor details the 15th Anniversary Edition is essentially a re-release of theFarscape: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] repackaged in a more minimalistic cover (first detail change... cool look though). Like the previous release you won't get 1080p high definition. Technically it can be called high definition because it's going to be more than 480p in resolution. However not by much. You see the original 35mm film used to film the episodes are pretty much lost so there is no remastering of the source material. Even if they had the original film the CG effects weren't done on that resolution so remastering would have been difficult. Best they can do is use the European PAL video master tapes, which should be at 576p resolution. While this isn't truly high definition it is the best these shows have ever looked, and the end result even has Brian Henson's approval on it.This Blu-Ray set will have 20 disks covering all 88 episodes (minus the mini-series of course) plus all of the extras from the previous Blu-Ray release (including the extras from the Starburst Edition DVDs). Here is a breakdown:Peacekeeper Wars Collectible Comic - This is the second thing different from the previous release. It is a 16 page comic written and drawn by award winning Ramon Perez. It's called Backyard Barbecue and it takes place at the same time of the Peacekeeper Wars (the mini series that Lionsgate still refuses to allow to be added to the collection). At 16 pages it's going to be short though. The comic will also include an interview with creator Brian Henson and some images from the Henson Archive. No idea if the interview and images are going to squeeze away at those 16 pages or are considered an addition to.Episode Commentaries - The packaging says 35 commentaries covering the spectrum of all the major cast and crew throughout, however it seems you are still only getting the same 31 commentaries found in the 2011 Blu-Ray. These are the original commentaries from the DVD collections.Memories of Moya: An Epic Journey Explored - New documentary exclusive to the Blu-Ray releases chronicling retrospective interviews from cast and crew.Farscape Undressed - This was a one hour behind the scenes feature shown on the Sci-Fi Channel to help prime new viewers for the third season. This feature wasn't released on the Starburst or DVD sets before it (it is in the new DVD series collection though) and was big in demand back in the day.In the Beginning: A Look Back with Brian Henson - A very informative interview with Brian Henson that was made in 2004. It runs about a half and hour and was on the Starburst release and up.Making of a Space Opera - A 22 minute documentary on the making of the series. Not quite as informative as Brian's interview, but makes a good promotional piece for the series.Season 3: A Look Back with Executive Producer David Kemper - Basically David's take on season three and how the show has matured so far.Farscape: The Story So Far - This is a 22 minute catch up feature for people to get familiar with Farscape up to the fourth season. This featurette was in previous collections.Inside Farscape: Villains - 15 minutes of interviews with the actors who make up the major villains Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), Crais (Lani Tupu), and Commandant Grayza (Rebecca Riggs). Cool to see Wayne out of makeup.Inside Farscape: Special Effects - Animal Logic was the visual effects company that worked on Farscape. This feature shows before and after images of various effect pieces along with a commentary explaining what you see.Inside Farscape: Save Farscape - Pretty inspiring piece on the efforts by fans and crew to revive the show enough for it get a proper send off.Deleted Scenes - There have been 90 minutes of deleted scenes previously released, and we are getting them all.Farscape in the Raw: Director's Cut Scenes - Compares the final scenes with the director's print. Keep in mind these scenes are without special effects, music, or sometimes even proper dubbing.Alternate Version of the Season 2 PremiereListening In with Composer Guy Gross - Focuses on Guy and the process he goes through composing the music for the series. You get to watch him at work pretty much while he gives a commentary on what he does.Behind the Scenes Interviews - I am thinking this may be the interviews from the previous collections from actors Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Gigi Edgley and Wayne Pygram.Zhaan Forever - A more in depth interview with Virginia Hey. Runs about ten minutes.On the Last Day: Wrap Speech from David Kemper - A goodbye speech from David to the crew. Recommended viewing once you finish watching the series.Production and Design Galleries - archival photo galleries, character concepts, promo photos, design gallery screen shots, rough drafts, and concept slide shows.Original TV promos and trailersFarscape is a sci-fi TV series that ranks right up there with the best of them. Every fan of the genre should get familiar with this show. This release has little to add to the table since the previous 2011 Blu-Ray. So if you bought the original you can breath happy unless you really need that comic. Although it seems at least at the time of this review be cheaper than the 2011 Blu-Ray, and you get the new cover art, a tiny bit more content and the 15th Anniversary moniker. If you haven't already made the plunge it looks like you are getting a better opportunity now.",0.881578947368421,1527,0.023438080346254678,0.029509789700998414,0.06959189171901692,0.040924083805042324,0.07546831648476222,0.24924667707155435,0.10539209403090086,0.06316917256689492,0.08551594722144855,0.1014558133216006,0.01441309640630516,0.027563731854592564,0.056357627317106244,0.06668470266169799,0.07820802529446816,0.047491531789154426,0.027821783311731473,0.0,0.05510735926498953,0.05257374029909467,0.03326487683291721,0.013331539771857762,0.06472167700110362,0.15177062006904948,0.13255455122564033,0.05428820081836943,0.0,0.013264524990614614,0.057446317659726416,0.07603477062677598,0.04728583420241358,0.0,0.030653362824348666,0.03445183019142472,0.014246820648097396,0.04433744188982535,0.13811904563432945,0.027859685071041033,0.18052956496279754,0.10405302477364789,0.0,0.022868412354027094,0.09788817512993707,0.027012493748756465,0.01464831260090197,0.013349971921887067,0.05880216284989554,0.014075175320029507,0.00865629073258796,0.0,0.06629238301231996,0.0,0.03993036082873871,0.03749809337882587,0.23972947327351565,0.20578102787494643,0.03821960536038576,0.026420697019636362,0.03568080065853516,0.027243672976444786,0.04638744139035197,0.015067174402725612,0.0,0.01289836171201303,0.05100543963605741,0.20610189552224029,0.0,0.10835422811366457,0.07492837194201023,0.011987894230609237,0.05011243477136249,0.03982993062337617,0.055908957683423424,0.602246757925346,0.0,0.028445969945752873,0.0,0.09106295027291851,0.04495195669269131,0.12561217336411418,0.024293292406481003,0.22018460217631095,0.01443975772351253,0.014801856693037995,0.09805579951227493,0.011845391456395677,0.06937201509195415,0.013763461256100454,0.014567378078720477,0.02834767333684472,0.0,0.0,0.05856179872120205,0.0,0.026709180979309778,0.05668088755043307,0.037537321251245793,0.1874320629635443,0.012736347213586434,0.2056555375050804,
872711,B0006SGYL0,AD9AB378M8ADD,2,4,1171843200,Were they trying to make a film this bad?,"The film has the same premise as the first: a curse comes upon anyone who enters this certain house where a terrible murder happened.  But now in part 2 the curse travels outside the house.  So now you can become cursed by coming into contact with a person who was a friend of a person who's cousin's boyfriend's mother was in the house.  Not really...but it does seem that just about everyone gets cursed in this one and it's rediculous.The Grudge 2 falls far below its predecessors.  The plot is inconsistent.  The acting is so bad that it's disgusting and is apparent from the very first scene of the film.  The cinematography is bad.  The scary scenes are predictable.  And there are plenty of horror movie cliches, too!  I kept watching this film - which seemed way too long - hoping it would get better and it just doesn't.  This movie was a total disaster and I really feel like I wasted my time and money renting it.",0.5,168,0.08172005825257123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24829499282048295,0.13362323094925543,0.06292797734860174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1162526475198332,0.07790940808979918,0.08279284580858835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23196504426907924,0.18592891408477097,0.0,0.07559556151993654,0.09243389806481091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08011776316482712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520750076925753,0.09713658513281655,0.18650100965322777,0.2720962783717543,0.1044992267503434,0.15946766647325214,0.07584454448752224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12072534481798025,0.0,0.0,0.08046841502388082,0.0,0.06537110398991522,0.13554315373784745,0.0,0.0666289288691704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17988757695113428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14928455449820038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11139096745206398,0.5102354978784404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937584361663656,0.0,0.17518557787839995,0.08470187153879304,0.0,0.20138472517985406,0.0,0.0,0.08260114015658694,0.1814062317816477,0.0,0.10158229407814924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09312519597435573,0.23715075794604487,0.0,0.059409764240308714,0.08881401726106593,0.06518600288930924,

I'm a long time Brooks admirer. He's the reason I wanted to become a filmmaker. But,&quot;Silent Movie&quot; is one of the few movies I stay away from. I'll give the movie some credit. It does have a great cast cast; Marty Feldman (Marty Eggs), Dom DeLuise (Dom Bell), Bernadette Peters (Vilma Kaplan), Sid Caesar (Studio Chief), Harold Gould (Engulf) Ron Carey (Devour) and cameos by Burt Reynolds, Paul Newman, Anne Bancroft (It's no suprise to find her in this movie, since she is after all Brooks' wife.) James Caan, Liza Minnelli, and Marcel Marceau (His one scene is an absolute highlight!). If the cast wasn't enough, as with any Brooks movie there is going to be laughs, how many depends on the movie. And this one offers a few. The scenes that really make me dislike this film are the scenes with Brooks, Feldman, and Deluise driving around in their car. It's these scenes that I feel slow the movie up. Whenever the movie starts to carry some energy, we see them in the car in the very next scene! For those who don't know, this movie is about a once great director (Brooks) who was ruined due to drinking. After some time away from movies he tries to make a comeback. His grand idea is to make a...you guessed it...a silent movie. After Sid Caesar warns him that slapstick is dead, and as soon as he's done saying that, he falls out of his chair and flies across the room, proving to us, that yes, slapstick is dead! Caesar won't hear of making a silent movie, even though his studio needs all the help in can get before a conglomerate &quot;Engulf &amp; Devour&quot; (who's tagline is &quot;our hands are in everything&quot;) buys the studio. After Brooks suggest what if he gets big stars to act in the film, the studio chief soon realizes that with big stars, the film could make big money, and so he agrees to let Brooks make his film. This all sound like it could be a good funny movie, don't you think? But, it's because of those Brooks, Feldman, and DeLuise &quot;car scenes&quot; I'm unable to suggest anyone renting or buying this. If you insist on buying it, my favorite moments are Brooks and Bancroft's scene together,the hospital scene with Caesar (That one scene offers the biggest laugh in my opinion)and the first time the executives at &quot;Engulf &amp; Devour&quot; first see a picture of Peters, ONLY Brooks would of thought of what you see in that scene. A hell of a lot better then most comedies being made today, but that's not saying much when films by Adam Sandler are being released. I don't know about you, but if I have to pick between Mel Brooks and Adam Sandler, get &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; in the vcr ready to go  lol. ** 1\2 out of *****",0.625,499,0.0554596171362851,0.13965321514491558,0.07057269220812937,0.0,0.0255106456570592,0.15446411491506037,0.09068389557500026,0.10676575633756559,0.050587352098421356,0.048013322592483636,0.03410453401614792,0.0,0.0,0.07889528544635607,0.05287350543266293,0.02809383417212215,0.0,0.10188472428267824,0.0,0.031100238003026075,0.10494928515105234,0.06309066959935876,0.019143202930189496,0.05130320497497021,0.06273060380408531,0.025691548010122283,0.05305876481252642,0.0,0.0,0.04497871845421942,0.16783291690875,0.03377649915008145,0.0362662756732479,0.13586759124708234,0.03371108925646556,0.1049120711118704,0.17201043585001094,0.0,0.1423907931978846,0.12310609125335309,0.0,0.0,0.025736089089373474,0.0,0.03466110690538958,0.03158894929235634,0.0,0.03330493892174336,0.2253094191304182,0.13453226822903894,0.03137245138339782,0.054610184870343095,0.03149465159489817,0.0221821696935887,0.13798028732148754,0.04234111790747819,0.09043593370587687,0.03125856980469324,0.05628571152599198,0.0,0.05488140883201387,0.0,0.6271192207811497,0.030520340901035864,0.0905175075868255,0.0,0.035910789320924695,0.0,0.025328127554811748,0.08509792796312889,0.0,0.0,0.17009074899991702,0.30631859227505576,0.03195122109679912,0.03365468884301828,0.03452998881245693,0.02693435363960839,0.0,0.089167751021175,0.0862248534824153,0.21453141235324427,0.0,0.0,0.02900267971291052,0.02802878330033985,0.020518667378764024,0.0,0.0,0.03353839322035411,0.0,0.0,0.05542800242868943,0.028616033738839995,0.0,0.08047161566269227,0.0,0.08063730862112581,0.03013697921268402,0.11059679961657752,

HALLOWEEN H20 is a roller-coaster ride and had me on the edge of my seat, even during the opening credits. Jamie Lee Curtis, who suggested this project, turns in an excellent performance, as does the supporting cast. The music score adds to the incredible tension of this sequel which is actually better than HALLOWEEN II, but of course, not as good as the first. The script is written for maximum suspense, though it does seem that it relies a little too heavily on false alarms. Otherwise, this is an amazing movie. Well crafted, well scripted, well acted, well scored, well shot and well directed. It's an excellent movie. Though the first HALLOWEEN is of course the best of the series.",0.5,138,0.0,0.0,0.1431360792189333,0.0,0.23283399818683037,0.12816217246405476,0.0,0.19488881819529738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101426450810103,0.060006010155879114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461661425783126,0.0,0.19194147479417936,0.05823958797771539,0.0,0.09542302122759425,0.07816169405275192,0.0,0.0954883131548438,0.0,0.06841963803267984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052330934109116274,0.0,0.24066508845366363,0.1404476576808014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1922068525465468,0.0,0.0,0.124629355490314,0.0,0.0,0.08307059894402335,0.0,0.06748507175719434,0.23321057006079696,0.12881487337516231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141292997986938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955755518570947,0.05749656172829448,0.4051811308027372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13563804080515318,0.0,0.0932387714793125,0.10394854760034272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5339001054502125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613667429728125,0.16321315219775412,0.0,0.1226619089515068,0.0,0.0,

Tom Holland, who gave us the delightfully campy FRIGHT NIGHT, also helmed this first in the Chucky series.  Considering this is pre CGI, the effects are very good, and the story creepy in itself.  Chucky of course is the embodiment of a serial killer, played with delightful relish by Brad Dourif.  Killed by detective Chris Sarandon (who was also in FRIGHT NIGHT), the madman uses a voodoo chant to send his spirit into a Good Guy doll in the toy store in which he is killed.  Single mom Catherine Hicks (quite good in her role) buys the doll for her son's birthday.  Best friend and babysitter Dinah Manoff (Soap) is the first victim to feel the wrath of the vengeful Chucky.  Holland keeps things moving quickly and the movie has some fairly suspenseful moments; the Chucky doll is a real killer!  Obviously, the sequels couldn't keep up the innovative thrills of this first movie, but CHILD'S PLAY is a vintage horror thriller.",0.8571428571428571,189,0.0,0.0,0.06220726869721301,0.17071364591423177,0.0,0.14853219850266672,0.05995092381385264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08816033683440663,0.05215749959875537,0.1398182323715151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25025461704308316,0.050622117329388136,0.0,0.0,0.203815510259935,0.0,0.0,0.14378140332364428,0.0,0.0739693147002899,0.17863655410087387,0.0,0.07185741247640909,0.0,0.0,0.3184040177635297,0.0871619099982217,0.2928620801581018,0.04069258301572992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10832840813933566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2027076984917616,0.0,0.05978699676781763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09920171151178236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501073722349288,0.07839097100694609,0.0,0.049976275501121895,0.5987150093970047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19649534661869789,0.0,0.1215653525385462,0.0,0.0,0.07669443095012356,0.07411906784899518,0.054259383410307886,0.0,0.09115110194316753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356243879672191,0.1418656214294547,0.0,0.05330914728625698,0.0,0.0,

This show is like a celebration of Styx's music on a unique concert filmed for posterity. Highlights songs are ""One for Everything"", who show a more progressive side of the band; the beautiful ""Just Be""; the Beatles's song ""I am the Walrus"" and the medley at the end. There is only one song that i would not have included in the set list and this is ""I don't need no doctor"", a rather too simplistic song.The Blu-Ray version is quiet spectacular for the great quality of the picture and the beautiful HD surround sound, where you can hear many things clearly with not too much echo, but a really well balanced sound. The band seems to enjoy playing a lot here, with many smiles on their faces.So a must for Styx fans, a good introduction to those who want discover the band, and have a good overview of their long career.",0.5,167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16290788609842158,0.0657532734761676,0.0,0.07335997148935165,0.06962720582094985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05720556276328165,0.0,0.08148135011627815,0.0,0.09849972583444724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2220863141350146,0.0,0.0,0.1490278618159732,0.07694392595078366,0.0,0.0,0.13045306253663674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04988867828178552,0.0,0.18354670522773187,0.0,0.0,0.0784707944100229,0.07464311467303582,0.0,0.20105719780878578,0.0,0.08070962444485179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099041731061293,0.0,0.0913448380762706,0.1286711613707418,0.26679211368362965,0.1228031542934546,0.13114696150469313,0.09066012331338309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851901692696637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21246130691751305,0.07345989217560313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0548132289095144,0.618034481504016,0.18533807930099588,0.0,0.0,0.07811847559214102,0.0,0.0862052588422543,0.0,0.13333105417212548,0.19819465245085194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483054700774961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555960844186688,0.0,0.11693734532526445,0.08740714206651173,0.06415341171366708,

The book is a bit more detailed with a couple extra scenes that are't mentioned in the movie which gives you greater understanding of the characters. I recall in the book she did acquire starlet stardom, and the trip to Hollywood, via Las Vegas is quite a detailed adventure. .  It is a long book, so I think they did a great job of editing for the movie.  The racial turmoil Peajoe observes is told wonderfully through his eyes. But the the other escapde of his Aunt could fail as a crazy farce if it wasn't done properly.  I mean really, a head in a tupperware ""fix and mix""?  LOL. It works however. In the book Melanie' character isn't as nice as the movie, and the ending is a bit different.  I love the peajoe character even better than Melanie's character.  The boy from Slingblade plays Peajoe, and he is wonderful and so believable!  It is one of those movies I can watch over every once in a while.  I do promote reading the book after the movie. Melanie is her usual self in this movie, but her ""usual self"" may be better geared toward this character. It may have been tailor made for her.",1.0,218,0.0,0.08929651483533703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17957607758783767,0.05798474326664282,0.16384258567584586,0.0,0.061400983410579674,0.0,0.08340775096704946,0.0,0.10089383219696217,0.0,0.07185460004853282,0.08418861372493977,0.0,0.0,0.07954397215525442,0.0,0.0,0.09792377799123055,0.0656081909663725,0.0,0.0,0.06785325743213182,0.0,0.0,0.05752023389585213,0.07154337997898798,0.25916685019914965,0.0,0.13900148151802355,0.0,0.06708246784526782,0.2639669828572079,0.0,0.32372254695200053,0.23614805199833502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817397064911537,0.0,0.0,0.07117405119424416,0.0,0.26193903841862315,0.08602209890606509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15684767616542908,0.05414718536120339,0.05782619245417639,0.0,0.07197998082726177,0.08243925398180196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07806078997095302,0.0,0.0,0.09184774809565457,0.0,0.12956170128142724,0.0,0.0,0.0803501488113603,0.04833722851967071,0.5790792518488127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06801222760917419,0.07602039469585274,0.0,0.07838562286883675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329636603268498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08082188316909433,0.0,0.0,0.05156079377117132,0.0,0.056573899841572343,

But, I am not ashamed, and a really do enjoy this movie.A relatively young, and  satiny-smooth Eastwood is the killer for hire, who avenges the murder of  U.S. government agents.  He also happens to be a world class mountain  climber and an art expert.  Conned into coming out of retirement, he takes  one last job for $100,000 (and the chance to avenge a friend).  Being  Clint, he kills the bad guys, survives himself when none others could, and  of course gets several girls.Great cinematography.  The scene where  Eastwood and George Kennedy scale the unconquerable pinnacle is stunning.  One  cannot always tell in that scene what was &quot;real&quot; and what  was actually a set up.  The final shot of that portion of the movie, when a  camera obviously set in a helicopter moves away from the height and showing  them sitting (and obviously heavily strapped to the top) is stunning.  Watching the final quarter, shot on a mountainside, makes one actually feel  cold.The movie is also incredibly sexist.  Having said that, I must  acknowledge that it also has two positively gorgeous women:  Vonnetta McKee  (for some reason given the moniker &quot;Jemimah Brown&quot; - spare me!)  and an otherwise unknown Brenda Venus (only named  &quot;George&quot;).Not thought provoking, not &quot;deep&quot;.

This is another movie where you really couldn't see where it was going until it went there.The rest of the characters were okay to good, although the rich couple felt a little bit not-organic.From a movie makers perspective, they brilliantly used the runners to both frame and quirkify the movie. It really worked.The movie also touches upon some serious issues, but does so in an organic and pragmatic way, instead of the typical culture-war histrionics we often see.My suggestion? Watch this before you watch another formulaic Hollywood dramedy and comedy!",1.0,142,0.0,0.0,0.07553612035034031,0.10364581803123363,0.08191448307867753,0.2705362152277083,0.0,0.06856480120859394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06333303566245338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236709435539571,0.0,0.0824953591152187,0.0851856387885765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055232416012539066,0.0,0.10160349331774415,0.2470579332942244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39461824217369507,0.0,0.0,0.08767643760610426,0.0,0.14245354574246308,0.19691272007125035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960011504139697,0.29065100676874944,0.0,0.11530926279621027,0.0,0.16265683776836118,0.09108292637087533,0.0,0.0,0.06068445118992395,0.4276463464279963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08648599824192596,0.08538521617943697,0.14315847451251398,0.0,0.19681676631666822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19765583996456174,0.2091470451911191,0.11068160924984814,0.10769151752827211,0.0,0.10458621401453376,0.08898944048821807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420501823832299,
1561163,B008JFUPFI,A2MMHXKIF9LGVO,6,14,1385510400,Waste of Film Burn the negatives erase from history.,"The Man Of Steel is not a Superman movie nor should it ever be seen as one. I could have overlooked the directors complete lack of vision and originality, Zack Snider has to this day not made an original film worth seeing as far as i am concerned. All his movies have the ghost of his influences floating within each and every frame. I don't fault this movie for being a dumb pop corn flick, i like those movies when they are good, even if this one feels especially dumb. No the fact that this movie is suppose to be a Superman film is the thing that makes me hate this joyless drag of a movie the most. A Superman who has no real reason to want to save any one thanks to his earth fathers fear mongering, a Superman who lacks any real basis for even liking humanity who destroys more property and lives than he actually saves. By the middle of this movie i found my self asking if this was suppose to be the origin story of a Villain version of Superman who was going to hide wile the world burned. I found the inability by the writers to see what road they had sent their main character on that i asked if it was possible for any one to write a movie script in Hollywood. this was a clumsy attempt to make superman more human instead succeeding in making the character seem callus and down right stupid. This is the perfect superman movie for people who hate superman. If all that old fashion goodness and dignity turned you off this movie is for you, if you hate the fact that superman never gives up hope and always finds a way to resolve a problem with out taking a life hey this movie is for you. This is a waste of time and money and a waste of a good guy like Henry Cavil as the lead. Snider shouldn't be allowed to take a video of a duck pond on a borrowed cell phone, let alone direct or write another movie again. Especially one with &#34;The Man Of Steel&#34; in a staring role.",0.42857142857142855,366,0.0,0.0,0.07658241644865596,0.0,0.04152456485196888,0.18285571638150497,0.03690233239736984,0.13902906677023147,0.0,0.1563059088783503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606404301970293,0.0,0.0,0.055280435963542325,0.0,0.10124587728817172,0.08541480008007415,0.0,0.18696034171030615,0.0,0.0,0.0836380518027842,0.0,0.05108932565365834,0.0885035425723233,0.07321342378074447,0.04553124563603514,0.0,0.0,0.1326938411484481,0.0,0.21346128196846223,0.08399620999038954,0.0,0.18026901240314566,0.05009601617538546,0.0,0.0,0.08378305392925378,0.0,0.0,0.05141843100051191,0.09059239887152763,0.0542116069792261,0.33340361339953234,0.1094914251065487,0.0,0.044445448259344086,0.10252987871991587,0.07221337761350766,0.27450537982443496,0.06892010967066282,0.18400714179292477,0.0,0.045809104754146325,0.0,0.04466618859530437,0.05803236680438764,0.0,0.0,0.04911283135879953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0482529623402146,0.05113600117154785,0.15381256978218483,0.34685594592889324,0.05200811341152769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865679380101059,0.29028289677634345,0.04678373058335748,0.2993144900525656,0.0,0.0,0.047208670090495314,0.0,0.13359579301901284,0.0,0.0561073632949769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04511104329553311,0.04657931299617178,0.0,0.21831074421823582,0.0,0.06562807535997436,0.0,0.14401780464001596,

Like Arthur Conan-Doyle, John Mortimer is less interested in the crime itself than what is going on /around/ the crime. However much fun it is to see Rumpole untangle the evidence and expose the true criminal, Mortimer is much more interested in the legal profession and the people who inhabit it -- most of whom lack Rumpole's integrity, and seem to be in it simply because of the status it brings. ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" is a comedy of manners about the law.Mortimer portrays most of the legal profession as not only self-involved to the point where it affects their interpretation of the law, but as insufferably ignorant and stupid. Rumpole constantly quotes poets, and one can understand that not every line he spouts will be recognized, but when supposedly educated people don't recognize ""Macbeth"" -- or Rumpole's wife doesn't know the meaning of the word ""compel"" -- one can see what Mortimer thinks of the general intelligence of the English.As someone who's dabbled in fiction, hearing Mortimer's clever dialog is depressing -- how could I ever write that well? Of course, Mortimer was helped by not having the turn out more than six episodes per season, giving him plenty of time to polish his work.Watching these episodes is addictive. Unreservedly recommended.PS: I should note that I purchased the megaset several weeks ago -- from Amazon -- when the price was half what it's currently going for. It might never come back to that price, but perhaps you should wait.",0.5,260,0.0587656696677105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14879273869272638,0.0,0.1357563176825836,0.0,0.10175097488269867,0.07227513941321062,0.0,0.0,0.12539757364769777,0.05602539496070339,0.11907424276668599,0.0,0.07197217676023654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040568730830326756,0.054361485926692946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05927925136465374,0.0,0.07685635373410615,0.05758676599698125,0.071441341923294,0.0,0.18226430282994457,0.0,0.23470063140654523,0.26088935575952166,0.0,0.0,0.05454053194230891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794646751728757,0.1411612369532881,0.0,0.0,0.1329704898706812,0.0,0.0,0.14102694436456933,0.3573913514609357,0.04486515192122573,0.09582699053242173,0.06624390438591181,0.0596410091043418,0.0,0.058152993274282985,0.151110087634433,0.0,0.0,0.12788456958199082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13315268778117176,0.20025575535638834,0.5362606626745251,0.06771178747377307,0.0,0.0,0.05707992266909998,0.0,0.0,0.06090991990854275,0.16237145361252942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696729559015796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061984326069810455,0.0,0.1761965110430405,0.12128755824363578,0.0,0.11369157422633919,0.06274421193411817,0.0,0.0,0.046875873496223804,

And a lot could have been done to make this movie come up to par with the competition song hi-lite! The restaurant scene, with Dolly throwing biscuits at Queen Latifah, was a comedy scene that never flourished into what it should have. There is no way either character would have been that contained considering the feud. Of course, the feud was pretty dumb ... a poor woman's prejudice over a rich woman's money is basically rediculous, especially when the rich woman is basically a good christian that spreads her wealth within the church with no strings attached.Dolly Parton, a legend ... no doubt ... is about to become another Mae West. Honestly, she is beginning to look a lot like Barbara Eden & Suzanne Somers looked in the early 2000s ... puffy comical. There are scenes where Dolly looks fanastic ... but there are also scenes where her face looks like it just may POP at any second. And that spiked hair-look is a total turn-off! Her fans still prefer her softer looks. Still ... she is worthy of her legend-status, and I never get tired of seeing her prance across the screen within our hearts.The Romeo & Juliet parts of the movie ... with Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan ... were quite good. The interplay was often magical, and both are extra-ordinarily talented ... especially Jeremy Jordan.Angela Grovey was a huge plus to the film ... though I kept praying she would not have a heart attack during her very heavy work during the competiton song routine, of which I think she was a little over the top with. Take some pounds off, girl, the world needs to keep you around for a whole lot longer than what is in your present future. Something that should have been said to John Candy too.I was disappointed when it came to the scene time for two great actors that were not used to their full potential ... Kris Kristofferson & Jesse L. Martin.But ... the best part of the movie is the competition production. I find myself rewinding a lot to see that production over and over again. It flowed like honey through most of it. The only real disappointment being Dolly's spiked hair-do, and puffy face.All in all ... doesn't come close to being as good as Sister Act ... with the exception of the compettion section ... but ... still good entertainment.LadyShalene",0.3333333333333333,416,0.04193388969755666,0.0,0.07114816494178067,0.048812473572974364,0.0,0.14864531721303786,0.13713504242346558,0.06458181546740595,0.07649978678265204,0.0,0.0,0.14794571153028085,0.05041570155529366,0.08948095123253724,0.0,0.0,0.04977692606851656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03967690343540335,0.0,0.05789790853837698,0.0,0.047431597194719566,0.15540627159664722,0.040118567455478836,0.0,0.0,0.17004558594064556,0.0,0.35754519919385236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803587925287467,0.04984473743236336,0.21532784120145318,0.11635306729195637,0.0,0.04091467675872409,0.11675677296526342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050364777372922116,0.12389818121886599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14288161162000068,0.0670891510049642,0.2086581353332439,0.03201478588718514,0.0,0.047270193556232826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0456278084227917,0.0,0.21722170560757267,0.0,0.0,0.042895922101630055,0.0,0.04750741507687471,0.2286369658720602,0.4833648217772976,0.04831764265097367,0.0,0.0,0.1221929331199106,0.0,0.022473713481244384,0.04346397952026185,0.25490233773400034,0.05166935164414824,0.052965039518185764,0.04385876552397056,0.04238600870196701,0.1861738495210058,0.0,0.05212601173058814,0.0,0.0,0.09851071475249386,0.08381997063877519,0.08654813461385938,0.0477863303031739,0.0,0.04477288997612025,0.18291341591396135,0.09114817789071389,0.033449592590065205,

Rather it's a series of grossly over-produced musical and dance extravaganzas, interspersed with stale and mostly un-funny comedy bits.  If you like Hollywood excess at its most excessive, this is for you.For decades Flo Ziegfeld dominated the pretty girl, funny men area of show business, presenting his shows at the New Amsterdam theater on 42nd Street, just off Broadway and Times Square.  Among his comic stars were W.C. Fields, Will Rogers and Fanny Brice.  By all accounts, however, what marked his shows were pretty show girls in very fancy costumes.  However, there were serious constraints:  the theater stage was not all that big.  Hollywood had no such constraint; thus, the movie presents a Follies that never existed and never could have existed:  underwater ballet, instant costume changes impossible in live theater, enormous sets that fit only on a sound stage.I repeat:  if you like excess, the movie is for you.

I viewed the 2009 film ME AND ORSON WELLES twice but rate it 3-1/2 stars, rounding off to four here, though you'd think any movie you want to see again deserves closer to five.  But if you browse other reviews, like many I find Christian McKay's performance as creative prodigy Orson Welles mesmerizing and if nothing else the reason to recommend this title.  I looked up the 2009 Best Supporting Actor nominees and while I did not view the titles of all five who were nominated instead of McKay, I think the only reason he could have been overlooked was ME AND ORSON WELLES did not play on enough screens.But McKay's work is not one of those great performances lost in a bad film.  ME AND ORSON WELLES has its moments, depicting the creative and personal chaos behind the scenes of the Orson Welles 1937 masterpiece play CAESAR, seemingly evidence of the memorable speech Welles wrote and gave years later in movie THE THIRD MAN:  ""In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""To its credit,  while ME AND ORSON WELLES depicts CAESAR director Welles as egotistical and condescending it makes me understand why the cast and crew puts up with him.  We all have faults for which others forgive us.  I've worked with and for people even worse than the Welles we see in ME AND ORSON WELLES.  I just wish I'd had a boss or colleague with Welles's genius, as learning from someone like Orson Welles would make putting up with his garbage worthwhile.Christian McKay's standout work in ME AND ORSON WELLES does not mean you will overlook Leo Bill as Norman, James Tupper as Joe, Claire Danes as Sonja, and Zac Efron as Richard, to name four other fine performances. Speaking of Claire Danes, in homage to things left to the imagination of the 1930s era, a scene where she seduces a male colleague is much different than how the actress has her way with a boyfriend in SHOP GIRL.How much of a genius was Orson Welles?  In ME AND ORSON WELLES he nicknames Richard, age 17, ""Junior.""  But in the year 1937, when he staged CAESAR, Orson Welles was 22.See ME AND ORSON WELLES.",0.0,419,0.0,0.0,0.06801240513453581,0.0,0.0,0.4059827843132441,0.0,0.21607410542781172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04714173433589051,0.048193697225027296,0.14256199748864182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04495794167673775,0.07585639441693719,0.0,0.08301920397757152,0.037081492702242494,0.0,0.0,0.038350395480079694,0.1814885492278209,0.07859948892192642,0.06502042205472665,0.12130811489426833,0.04882669639653531,0.05242587231620953,0.0392815466071406,0.09746428207424084,0.07582949644588412,0.24865517562864253,0.0,0.04574167907062349,0.04448998485221305,0.1025189107990396,0.03911141733507758,0.11161087501852542,0.0461989621278952,0.05010546937139368,0.41097972491377677,0.0,0.0,0.05921876764766178,0.0,0.09070289683402763,0.0,0.0,0.1282645735702506,0.1994618082773311,0.030603777199824992,0.032683137606812906,0.04518682326614014,0.04068280338840195,0.09318868726227664,0.0,0.051538212360564245,0.0,0.0,0.13085047215446402,0.0,0.05191198767349174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082717913376702,0.027320012336836126,0.36579842346989433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15376097920733695,0.02148321474509723,0.0,0.19936461237554767,0.0,0.0,0.1257772480270343,0.0,0.08898424358126424,0.0,0.04982862777654653,0.09696498954030287,0.0,0.04708449365715729,0.04006285900777722,0.04136682091388333,0.04568021197920818,0.03877610414904388,0.04279958498707101,0.14570979398955616,0.04356547218786794,0.12790138689773742,

But I was pleasently surprised, this is a well written and well acted movie which is not only very funny but also rewarding. While a lot of what's happening in the plot is totally absurd (on purpose), the main characters are believable and even likeable. The true subject of the movie is the camaraderie between the 3 buddies(eventually accepting the 4th one as well)and how they overcome together ridiculously tough (and hillariously funny) situations. I read that the actors playing Doug, Phil and Stu are actually buddies in real life and it shows in the way they talk and care for each other. As many have noticed the plot has a lot in common with 'Dude, where's my car?' but I think The Hangover is even better since the heroes are (more or less) mature individuals who are able to digest the absurdity of their situation, and not just stoners who most of the time are not even aware to wjhat's really happening.",0.0,184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08279346428749257,0.0,0.2881432285372589,0.29075266029278823,0.10954069403035775,0.0,0.06157653984643749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517734586674114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23931420796029057,0.0,0.0,0.049101879827153895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06973174533020328,0.05768469457207518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08646817669696223,0.0,0.22060142654612697,0.0,0.20290507989796933,0.03947054027973043,0.0,0.06939758592634074,0.0,0.0,0.08890495034457256,0.0,0.07137755058560848,0.0854264103321583,0.10507518766380353,0.0,0.0,0.07003694064731154,0.0,0.1706902812301764,0.1966201647911539,0.054302001886049264,0.05799152792085125,0.08017752012116165,0.14437156903229628,0.08267496261055544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07828397978496476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695086666950693,0.5465740643774869,0.08195415492105033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13641337355843347,0.07623775065342864,0.07372159558403286,0.07860974143842593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189319124566172,0.10525982966586468,0.0,0.08841373474372143,0.0,0.22506597082685528,0.0,0.07108578235935155,0.0,0.08105296744430218,0.13760524179002745,0.07594170907450425,0.051708215338085624,0.0,0.0,

These are Hour long episodes that some people don't even know exist or think they are 30 min episodes, like Seasons 1-6.",1.0,123,0.0,0.0,0.18022079910872776,0.1236437088854442,0.0,0.1075782302781204,0.43420984489884196,0.16358800541029103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15110559351116423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13009101575043466,0.0,0.11913056389107143,0.0,0.0,0.1466574345529309,0.09825937244423566,0.0,0.0,0.20324347906485415,0.0,0.20827469158055462,0.08614628756261496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06060366442251239,0.058945280692107034,0.0,0.10363831234110255,0.09858300136705042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091862485800468,0.0,0.2549087615021659,0.058726486747862995,0.08109457637599786,0.0,0.0,0.10780220640834273,0.0,0.0,0.13656711298303645,0.0,0.11690924748982169,0.0,0.0,0.13755755120455881,0.0,0.0,0.2173137526733806,0.0,0.0,0.07239318246818992,0.25507917911233474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031729961943015,0.3055794728513669,0.056926705078685955,0.0,0.29348934935921916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104445196525786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11544076695590602,0.0,

1080964,B000RBA6C4,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,4,5,1193702400,anemic family comedy,"""Are We Done Yet?"" is probably the only film in movie history to be both a sequel to one movie (""Are We There Yet?"") and a remake of another (""Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House"").The movie picks up where ""Are We There Yet?"" left off, with confirmed bachelor Nick Persons having tied the knot with his main squeeze, Suzanne (Nia Long), and adopted her two children, Kevin and Lindsey.  Desperate to get his new family out of his two-by-four Portland apartment, Nick purchases a home in the country, a dilapidated relic that gives a whole new meaning to the term ""fixer-upper.""""Are We Done Yet?"" starts off with a clever animated title sequence that brings to mind the work of the great Saul Bass in the 1950's and 1960's.  Unfortunately, it's strictly downhill from there.  For bad as it was, the original found at least a modicum of comic tension in the conflict between Nick and the two bratty kids who hated him.  Here Nick is forced to wage an endless battle with an assortment of woodland creatures, shady contractors, loose floorboards, insect infestations, dry rot and a whole host of other homeowner inconveniences.  Far from being antagonists, the other family members are reduced to little more than a grating Greek chorus cynically commenting on the hapless man's nonstop travails.Ice Cube demonstrates a certain minor flair as an actor, but even Jim Carrey would have trouble making a silk purse out of this pratfall-laden sow's ear.  With its bland mixture of anemic slapstick and gooey sentimentality, ""Are We Done Yet?"" is about as dreadful a movie comedy as has come down the pike in quite some time.  Perhaps a more appropriate title would have been ""Is it Over Yet?""",0.8,288,0.057873641546971076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15972637807005244,0.20514781404894117,0.2838934455872842,0.17826082272692484,0.05278929847207669,0.050103227621787635,0.0,0.06806075896503307,0.0,0.04116470420673933,0.0551749625898469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06490791387144372,0.05475873818707816,0.0,0.03995292148231819,0.10707262142239489,0.06546111686384921,0.0,0.055368285867162116,0.0,0.056738906042084716,0.09387306885530342,0.0,0.07049341865162126,0.07568971972523705,0.22685053174777778,0.0,0.0,0.1794976384755586,0.0,0.1320788654782866,0.09634845359557916,0.07400570827046296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615610987544982,0.0,0.1709938901422758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2559755360371267,0.04418412544128808,0.047186196736609336,0.06523836108360728,0.0,0.13454093005646836,0.1145405304379098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05920135807676294,0.0,0.06556575435315308,0.07888639655599167,0.3891414526452691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16864044957333787,0.0,0.0310163366104016,0.059985343336921376,0.22386945132684619,0.0,0.21929373118291315,0.060530193906023974,0.0,0.04282359173097099,0.0,0.0,0.3499823921478578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055982901674490146,0.0,0.21036814422030264,0.1257950791818411,0.0,
533891,B00003CXRA,A1M0EXNAM09BVF,7,11,1013299200,Entertaining thriller set against a backdrop of war,"There was a Russian sniper ace by the name of Vassily Zaitzev in the Battle of Stalingrad.  And there was an instructor from a German sniper school sent to get rid of him.  The two dueled for days in the rubbles of Stalingrad until one day, the German killed an overly-enthusiastic political commissar at the side of Zaitzev.  But in the process Zaitzev caught a glint off the German's sniperscope.  He killed the German with one shot.Those are the historical facts.  What happened in the movie is creative license.  Contrary to the claims of some reviewers, this movie is not a ""chick flick"" in the guise of a war movie.  If anything, the romantic triangle between Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz is underdeveloped, and seems oddly detached from the rest of the action.  There are some dramatic (read gruesome) battle sequences in the tradition of SPR, and the film does give a flavor of the brutality of the Eastern Front, although as some have pointed out, it is NOT a historically accurate depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad per se.Mostly, this is a movie about the personal duel between 2 soldiers, played with admirable nuances by Jude Law and Ed Harris.  The grand ideological conflict behind the war does not matter here.  The bombs raining overhead merely set the stage for a contest of skills and will between 2 reluctant warriors, neither of whom takes pleasure in the prospect of killing, but both equally determined to perform his duties.  I was strangely reminded of Heat as I watched the film.  And in many ways, although the setting cannot be more different, this film is closer in spirit to the classic cop-and-gangster cat-and-mouse thriller than most war movies.A very well done and entertaining film.  Although I think the film left a great deal unexplored with regards to the psychology of the protagonists, and the ending was too saccharine to be believable.  This weakness in the writing is what kept the film from being a 5-star masterpiece.",0.6363636363636364,337,0.03970755526244511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305967293060084,0.22118408657536834,0.06492716648420993,0.061153067962843234,0.03621914796297105,0.06875242775259999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05648684698109707,0.07571194131136717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22542237514815244,0.0,0.0548240198905648,0.11019503659815383,0.04491338104762321,0.0,0.03798861125876851,0.0,0.0,0.03220352106409277,0.04005457885170167,0.0,0.05193130496807537,0.038910978231684205,0.0,0.03755707374552574,0.24630944964684576,0.0,0.15858558822527646,0.022035140945770883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04963279189328587,0.0,0.039847804878553224,0.0476908341973479,0.11732023700036617,0.04816069557566077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529092782425665,0.39516031064422286,0.0,0.0647496326293151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0392935740743198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218555356778597,0.0,0.044985173642282814,0.0,0.6865533645127954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11570552313495062,0.0,0.08512219843616031,0.0,0.1316559175549865,0.0489261466222693,0.05015304444244035,0.0,0.040135670576390614,0.11752639645554931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04188237906143996,0.0,0.07936984000865582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04239582866766011,0.08660113124527796,0.0,0.0,

It is a look at one's man's hollow life coming to fruition with a love of a woman.For those going to see this movie for Will Farrell's typical comedy antics - don't go, as you are bound to be highly disappointed. For the first time, Farrell portrays his character (Harold Crick, the IRS auditor lacking a personal life) without tricks or antics. Farrell succeeds beautifully - his character comes off as kind and lovable, a man trapped in the undeniably typical boredom of our lives. Crick's shortcomings are all of our shortcomings, his heroism stemming from the narrator's guiding hand, rather than from his human nature.Emma Thompson is exceptional as Kay Eiffel, the elusive writer, of eight tragedies, suffering from writer's block and experiencing all the possible ways she can kill her main character. Also notable is Queen Latifah's performance as the assistant, nee publisher's spy.If the movie feels like it's trying to be excessively moral or philosophic at times, that's because it is. But like a novel that falls short in a few places, but is amazing overall, this movie manages to pick up pace and remind you of its good parts, before you get dragged down by its negatives.The ending is satisfyingly American, but in a unique way - it doesn't just make the movie more pleasant, it makes sense. Stranger than Fiction often feels like it could've have been written by Charlie Kaufman, except that it's easier to follow and without any craziness and abruptness.",0.0,267,0.0,0.0,0.11195792016827423,0.07681073747960933,0.0,0.23390653253731805,0.10789704937915577,0.20325037887733585,0.1203791697018546,0.11425393242693253,0.08115616488376469,0.0776018804059552,0.0,0.14080617824607683,0.1258193682647621,0.0668529245176126,0.0,0.08081597478218887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506621820735555,0.1366612075101417,0.1831239517908181,0.07463780656220038,0.06113637281897519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0535163490197917,0.0,0.08037556334657585,0.0,0.2586516533523032,0.0,0.06241297225627567,0.12279634684609997,0.0,0.2635401784817829,0.2563285560746738,0.16876044904268536,0.0643828567892412,0.18372709229319897,0.07604994564654159,0.0,0.0,0.0662197475024239,0.0,0.19496472879162643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21889466746112266,0.050378092611311126,0.05380101032736775,0.0,0.1339391555105424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179938564869995,0.0,0.08545438380290404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22427133808426888,0.1349176707169823,0.34861623035929756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07072874534084518,0.06839440979689158,0.2187880021060694,0.0,0.0,0.06901564043471534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820248823676499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07045409598056657,0.04797173530607786,0.0,0.15790766297026396,

This film is a mish mosh of cliched lines that begged for a fresh twist. And what a disappointing and boring Khan. When you think your going to see a modern Star Trek film with Khan in it you are naturally pumped, until you get a yawn fest with a preppie looking dude that could pass for a backround walk by extra.I kept thinking, ""please don't let this guy be Khan"" or many variations of that with expletives included. Uhura lost her mojo from the first film, Scotty was over the top annoying with ""humor"" fit for a flopped SNL skit and Kirk turned in a listless portrayal. Forget Sulu and Chekov, they were cardboard embarrassments. Spock however still shined through, and was the only saving grace of the film.Tons of sweeping camera shots that hoped to provide more substance then was actually before you abounded. The film makers also seemed hard pressed to keep the camera away from being aimed at any alien looking wanderers or crew members. Except for the midget with the plopped on stupid looking alien mask that drank with Scotty.What happened to the Star Trek I know? The core was ripped out, I can tell you that. The film is visually pleasing at times but  it doesn't save a scene jumping tired old mess ripped  directly from a bad ""Next Generation"" episode. The film should have been titled, "" Star Trek- The Shooting of Phasers Part 1 (with minimal plot)"".

This sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" has Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) out to clear his name and save his own life after being framed for the murder of two CIA operatives in Berlin. Racing across India, Berlin and Moscow, Bourne does battle with a murderous assassin (Karl Urban, unrecognizable from his turn as the noble warrior Eomer in ""The Lord of the Rings"") and two squabbling CIA division chiefs (Joan Allen, Brian Cox). There are car chases, shootings and stunts galore, and Greengrass doesn't miss a trick in keeping the film moving at breakneck speed. Damon, all traces of his ""Good Will Hunting"" baby fat gone, is a thoroughly believable action hero, and the rest of the cast--particularly Allen and Cox--is quite fine. Like a ride on a particularly slick rollercoaster, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a fine way to pass the time on a lazy summer day.",0.25,173,0.0,0.11773568725775604,0.07932911447957884,0.0,0.0,0.3314745052299101,0.07645173623574789,0.07200773536049909,0.08529609088737929,0.08095598124380474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06651326031974819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08847827958452284,0.0,0.0645552814795358,0.08650310112783044,0.0,0.08663780661400712,0.0,0.0,0.09167780263600357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36654140391814116,0.0,0.0,0.17401762094163584,0.0,0.1600581638733608,0.10378551073306418,0.0,0.0,0.08678800937364713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907228745650511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2585006954382703,0.2141759762963876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253636416184267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5389443749329227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082883292911255,0.0,0.05011569282197907,0.09692334327729545,0.15502483825837451,0.0,0.2362208322191714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11623940983786121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19968434701885024,0.0679818859828783,0.0,0.14918313421260496,

With his divine voice, handsome face and terrific physique (only improved by wearing tights in Kiss Me Kate), he simply takes over every scene in which he makes an entrance.  These films are 4 of the very best Broadway musicals ever translated to the big screen - and what a pleasure to watch Howard Keel lend his immense talent to 4 very different roles, each one a treat in itself.

It is definitely geared for less mature audiences.  However, I think that some of the subject matter shouldn't really be viewed even by teenagers.  *************semi spoiler************I wasn't impressed, as a mother, with the affair between  Pacey and his teacher, nor that Joey (female) climbs into Dawson's window at night to sleep with him, sweetly platonic at the outset.  While all of that is fairly innocent and helps develop the conflict of the program, I don't find it appropriate.

22190,076784744X,A2GB5CG77LGQRB,0,1,985392000,A flunk,"Hanging UpScore: 38/100It is a question asked so much in cinema nowadays: how can so much talent create such a big flop? Some of these movies are Hook and Mystery Men, and now, Hanging Up can be one of those movies I can add to my list. It boasts a flashy cast and the girly-vibe, but it never creates atmosphere and largely uninteresting.Lou Mozell (Walter Mathau) is an ageing screenwriter who is struck down by illness. His three very different daughters, who had been leading separate lives as an editor, Eve (Meg Ryan), an actress, Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), and a businesswoman, Georgia (Diane Keaton), come back together to look after their father. In doing so, the daughters come together and settle the differences between themselves.It has such a great, star-studded cast and could've become a really memorable and absorbing, maybe even Oscar worthy picture, if the script was up to at least the average standard and the story could've been twenty times more interesting. When it tries to be dramatic or moving, Hanging Up just ends up acting like a TV movie that has been stuck together like a puzzle, except the pieces aren't put in the correct places. At times Hanging Up can be watchable thanks to the leading ladies, but overall, it's a messy and boring picture that isn't worth money or time.Disappointing, over-long and rarely intriguing, Hanging Up will sink to the bottom of the barrel even more with time. And it's half way to the end anyway.",0.0,251,0.0,0.07731734181764745,0.0,0.0,0.16948398716426175,0.37316605241494105,0.050206060377861704,0.04728767307565567,0.1120283436306043,0.15949203049132318,0.0,0.21665567587891757,0.0,0.0873588731391103,0.05854557502872177,0.24886107518831213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377462154262591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0587507083338586,0.06950763276455192,0.12041011809750582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060177180932012506,0.07465497470667476,0.058083320563272686,0.1142778387251646,0.0,0.10511062580208809,0.20446867035735125,0.0,0.05991655219228496,0.11398783737890683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12325203183751657,0.0,0.045359956558537806,0.14896438091130812,0.13895187703344514,0.06046855886509764,0.0,0.0,0.10185486029674662,0.0,0.05006877923776864,0.0,0.12464765936076083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06758889517546288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16827139944247693,0.062817941116704,0.06564872687657455,0.0,0.08370552931129996,0.3539262175126265,0.07075765439324756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729963933320756,0.23754553051036364,0.0,0.0,0.38536772939981834,0.062071210230752606,0.045439664750153624,0.0,0.07633473242008422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633717071176725,0.0,0.11880574146189052,0.06556662331400753,0.04464388698423534,0.0,0.0,

Sure the acting is kind of stilted, the dialog corny and the special effects are typical ""1950-60's Japanese plastic tanks and fireworks"" but that's one thing that makes them great.I love these old original Godzilla movies, as well as Rodan, Mothra and the rest. And all of these things I mentioned are incidental and inconsequential for they are observed thru my now 64 year old eyes. What I love about these flicks is how they take me back to being about 10 years old, sitting in the movie theater with my brother, enjoying a Saturday afternoon watching a double feature with cartoons, previews and so on - and to kids like us they were the ""Real Deal"" of a dinosaur come back to life and on a rampage. We might even stay to watch it twice before calling Dad to come get us - you could do that back then - but looking back now I'm sure he and Mom didn't mind having us boys gone for the afternoon so they could have their own fun.",0.0,179,0.18020748830001068,0.0,0.07643836640117498,0.0,0.0,0.41065147869226387,0.22099751893354708,0.13876755577856778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128179042365749,0.0,0.0,0.10695615034521058,0.0,0.0,0.10105543574679787,0.0,0.0,0.12440578194362671,0.0,0.10191672008209006,0.0,0.08620314413341482,0.0,0.0,0.07307571074345826,0.09089120448327753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10953899497424587,0.0,0.055892143160216776,0.0,0.1028171027826169,0.050001786535693815,0.0,0.0,0.083625459621627,0.2076899464149592,0.0,0.10264342784810733,0.0,0.0,0.1331105950546506,0.109285473848848,0.0,0.17744738891543985,0.0,0.0,0.1494485675467024,0.13758094454873382,0.07346441116404541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645997028352602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18422790156797061,0.3029280770145855,0.10382057430766758,0.10935573051316169,0.11219988301810956,0.0,0.34562042155705874,0.0,0.0,0.24895957106069685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058226077662846,0.0,0.10897784579013707,0.09503881924744682,0.10583545077872954,0.09005238058726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310092604333768,0.0,0.07187345496434501,

Whilst it doesn't stand up to comparison to some of their earlier classics, its still funny and in places a clever film.Groucho, who was 56 when this was made, plays Ronald Kornblow a replacement manager for the recently murdered previous manager. Actually the plot really doesn't matter very much. What you need to know is that Groucho gets to deliver some classic one-liners:Ronald Kornblow: You know, I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.Beatrice Rheiner: [eagerly] Do you really?Ronald Kornblow: No, but I don't mind lying if it'll get me somewheres.and perhaps my favouriteMr. Smythe: Sir, this lady is my wife. You should be ashamed.Ronald Kornblow: If this lady is your wife, YOU should be ashamed.Harpo and Chico get to do their inimitable musical turns and theres a lovely set piece with Chico trying to translate Harpo's whistling into words. In fact there are a number of very clever set pieces which certainly make the film worth 3.5 stars.On the downside some of the support actors were a bit wooden and a couple times the plot was explained to the viewer uneccessarily through the dialog. However overall this was better than I expected.I strongly recommend purchasing this in the boxed that is available, which also contains 'A Day At The Races' and 'A Night At The Opera'.",1.0,237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07651985051602675,0.0,0.2330207141837321,0.05374421832497779,0.10124032862689449,0.11992328641909793,0.11382124579259495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04675764554394962,0.0,0.0,0.1560635084889064,0.08050991973982455,0.0,0.0,0.1865959967349525,0.0,0.04538122105125306,0.0,0.14871029724196685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124353221021448,0.203885515942615,0.07813805730686793,0.15002407754140176,0.07295937832735555,0.16812134289417466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07488533114552615,0.0,0.07895328701356225,0.0,0.0,0.074372097310028,0.12945988611668044,0.0746617873285077,0.0,0.10903284997964638,0.05018730769149863,0.05359726260868509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470413776006477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20173467804638337,0.0,0.07447400293391392,0.08960448616075886,0.4420130900944571,0.15148827839719795,0.0,0.0,0.06385106300388528,0.0,0.21138267376111347,0.0,0.25428601164454473,0.0,0.0,0.06875427398069463,0.13289107526979568,0.243209609015937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07721412802219987,0.06569930956221771,0.06783768408286724,0.14982247707818971,0.06358915297608396,0.0,0.04779006340864716,0.0,0.31461931397358034,

1167912,B001AR0D6I,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,1,2,1350345600,Eh. Seen better by Argento.,"I've waited a long time to watch this, partially because I wanted to lower my expectations for it. I'd heard that the reviews for this predominantly stated that this was a mediocre movie for Argento and a somewhat disappointing finale to the Three Mothers trilogy, so I wanted to distance myself from Suspira and Inferno. Given how much trouble this had coming to the screen, which is never a good sign, I wanted to give it a fighting chance. Those are two of my favorite movies and it's not entirely fair to hold them up against those two. I hate to say it, but this film fully lived up to the reviews.The story here is decent enough and Argento has a good way of bringing a story to the small or big screen. There's some great atmosphere here, but ultimately this just fell short of what it could be. It was fun enough to be a ""beer and pizza"" movie for many, but I kept feeling my attention wandering. The violence is decent and as always, Argento never spares anyone. It's one of his calling cards, that he won't spare someone if they're in a situation where they're going to die. This is what makes so many of his films so horrifying and for supernatural horror, rather realistic at times. If someone is going to go crazy, they're not going to stop for cute kittens or whatever equivalent there is in a horror movie. I'd elaborate on the ""equivalent"", but it'd be semi-spoilerish.It's not a bad movie, but you feel every minute of this movie towards the end and I can't help but wish that there'd been about 10-20 minutes shaved off. I think that Argento did well enough given the amount of time that passed between the movies, the almost unfair expectations of the film by many viewers, and what I've been told is a rather small budget for a movie that is relatively flashy. This probably won't bring in any new converts and if this is your first time watching an Argento film, be aware that there is better and this isn't the best he has to offer. Would I recommend purchasing it? Nah. Borrow a friend's copy or Netflix it.",0.5,373,0.04260643750576789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03919672677322373,0.23733181002096984,0.03483361343895708,0.0328087986180947,0.03886335620505943,0.14754350888892234,0.052401108130681696,0.10021233832625763,0.05122428310651617,0.18183214503318068,0.040619676464620655,0.043165757419871977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12093975914245317,0.04846893668372313,0.20589272158541613,0.03941330484197578,0.0,0.07894936108410594,0.0407620006024003,0.04822529377041133,0.08354209584222161,0.0,0.08595759166663897,0.0,0.0,0.08350341144696603,0.05179658612238205,0.12089687503010402,0.0792874411740769,0.0,0.24309036797287303,0.26008217689926316,0.0,0.04157087813608771,0.0,0.0,0.1597688222350547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18882794393459876,0.10335341235270737,0.048203303891723046,0.12586160249568712,0.0,0.10224771921556024,0.1884485819044174,0.032528248249824795,0.03473836601005167,0.0,0.12972323509050243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674887128957444,0.04358389926279314,0.09109587000324065,0.0,0.2323039114233163,0.2864850135545364,0.0,0.05170992772786282,0.0,0.165536931462646,0.1225724998780789,0.25117568712416877,0.132483202050053,0.3531689112119898,0.0,0.1076290161727399,0.0891243700908604,0.0,0.06305325312482002,0.05003925604895438,0.052962023729309124,0.0,0.04494003607826849,0.0,0.1277464492268777,0.0,0.04855274124047672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046305019318200684,0.033986066796113344,

However, as the film progressed, the film maker's style became clearer, the characters became ""more real"" and more importantly more interesting. By the end of the film I could truly empathize with the lead character - he really did a great job of convey his emotional pain as did the director in moving this story forward and painting a picture of ""realism"". I felt the film could have used a bit tighter editing (some of the classroom scenes seemed a bit disconnected), there was an apparent lacking in skill with some of the actors and the ending was a bit unbelievable for me (I really did not feel these characters shared a ""physical"" attraction and the ""jump"" seemed a bit unbelievable). This film had a very ""real world"", ""unpolished"" feel to it; the dialogue felt unscripted, the situations real and the character's story believable - it is not a typical ""Polished"", ""Hollywood"" Drama and was clearly produced on a ""no budget"", however it's believability and realism was masterfully crafted...",1.0,211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061928306139339966,0.2727047188518639,0.0,0.10367158138690764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641764750902715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31846172904196896,0.0,0.046471035954365844,0.0,0.0761407627409472,0.0,0.06440133806993888,0.07619286104047336,0.0,0.054593989576608395,0.06790373189233258,0.0,0.0,0.06596500847743711,0.0,0.0,0.12526905520558368,0.0,0.03840671394437142,0.14942294697754072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668367742216688,0.20265957624889422,0.0,0.049722666841117806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07645476527486463,0.10769654473556801,0.18608539590596504,0.05139253916395131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22226873912225206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20657926912429442,0.14392561292755687,0.0,0.0,0.6142807040300795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06538442500757924,0.0,0.07215298608050899,0.06977164481397792,0.07439788728268408,0.08294352451099071,0.0,0.0,0.1360824101648207,0.2490502067421739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15813679915981815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978754517167556,0.0,0.0,
26725,0780022343,A3L31489BCB1D7,64,67,947894400,Dreyer and Einhorn - Perfect Together,"There's nothing to add to the chorus of high praise this masterpiece has already received, so I won't try. Just one point: the restored version features a new score, VOICES OF LIGHT. I'm not the biggest fan of grafting  new music to vintage films - too often it's ill-fitting, adding nothing but  a showy distraction to the narrative . Here it's a marriage made in Heaven.  Absolutely the most moving and mesmerizing film score I've ever heard,  greatly enhancing an already great movie. Viewers in 1928 were probably  thunderstruck by Dreyer's vision and imagery, but Einhorn's score gives  voice to Joan's inner devotion and faith, transforming this film of sexist  persecution and religious hypocrisy into a true passion play of martyrdom.  As for  historical inaccuracies, remember that this is not a movie about  Joan of Arc but about the Trial of Joan of Arc. It's not History but  History refracted through slow glass for the purposes of Art.",0.9552238805970149,158,0.20586674895151713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469581573502914,0.20849912920566976,0.0,0.07926314782358679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2928602244499955,0.0981335359956094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947864883897403,0.0,0.142119587377348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09847737849051473,0.0,0.10091514732548311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12770095086360428,0.1223518032974238,0.058728477063153414,0.17136422020488956,0.0,0.10043155487686016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236283237044254,0.1520638554668829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24702142181877296,0.5121844440517462,0.0,0.08392481151949263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09401830639986461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015320602515342,0.34606119295833854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999806364560861,0.0,0.16549586854285686,0.0,0.28440825627237176,0.1268306078941361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12090507659350176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

It is a pure fantasy to start off with.  I can imagine calling it ""Cinderella and the Princess"" but the obvious Cinderella doesn't have any sisters that we know of and the Princess is low man on her totem-pole, for sure.  Together, not really trusting each other, they commit to each other ""anyway"" and, when everything falls apart in the middle of the caper they hang tight and battle individually through to their eventual reunion. There is suspense.  Once things get moving it is one change after another in rapid-fire succession until the very end.  About half-way through you think it is almost over and then everything starts falling apart.  It goes on and on and on.  There is violence.  It is sudden violence.  Torture is depicted.  There is lots of blood.  There is not so much skin but there is a lot of female sexuality expressed.

863829,B00068S97M,ACG804LHU688Z,183,189,1117065600,Rebounding is Fun,"I just got this in the mail today.  I've had a mini-trampoline for many years and have always loved messing around on it, but I'm the type of person who benefits from instruction.  I am glad to see these workouts.They tell you to use their Urban Rebounder, but my no-name model from Sears works fine.  I don't know if I could add the stability bar on to it, but I don't think I'll need to use that.I started at the beginning and did the first workout:  First-Timers.  It was so difficult I couldn't believe it.  They slowed everything down so much that it was no fun and I was completely out of breath.  I had to take jogging breaks to catch my breath.  However, the First-Timers workout only needs to be gone through one time, if that.  I think you can learn all the basics from the second workout:  The Basic.The Basic workout was really fun and up to tempo (unlike the First-Timers).  It was exactly what I was hoping for: a good workout on the mini-tramp.  It included a warm up, cardio section, jogging/sprinting section, cool down, and abs workout (which I thought was pretty tough).  The moves were all basic but the warm up and cool down had some variety not included in the cardio section.This disc includes 6 workouts, not four.  They are:  First-Timers, Basic Program, Intermediate, Advanced, Oldies But Goodies (for Seniors), and Abdominal Bound.I haven't tried the other four yet, but the other reviewer covered the Advanced program and the fundamental outline of all the programs. I did look at the workout for seniors.  The music for it is also very slow so I don't know if it will be a fun workout.  It has a different instructor (JoJo) who is very interesting.The main instructor, JB Berns, puts me in mind of the martial arts instructor from Napoleon Dynamite, but he's not that bad.  He's actually kind of funny.  He does take the name of the Lord in vain twice in First-Timers and once in Basic.  I hope that will not continue into the other programs.  You'd think someone would have told him . . . (unless they didn't want their face smashed?)He mentions checking your heart rate one time, but gave no time to do so.  I'm glad he mentioned it because I was so focused on the moves that I didn't realize how elevated my heart rate was.  After that, I had to modify the moves myself to keep my heart rate down.  They had five people on camera; you'd think one of them could have demonstrated some modifications.Sometimes he gives good instructions on form, but other times none.  He says, ""use good form,"" but doesn't explicate.  If you are a beginner you will need to learn about form from other fitness instructors (Karen Voight being the best I know of).The demonstrators are all wearing gym shoes, so I wore mine.  I tried the cool down barefoot because my feet were hot, but I think it's better to wear shoes for the workout.I'd have to say that maybe this DVD only deserves three stars because of its weaknesses, but I gave it four because it's unique (are there any other rebounder DVDs out there?) and because it's a good value.  You get six workouts on one disc.There are other compilations too, with different instructors, including ballet, dance, pilates (core), African, Latin, kick, boxing, hip hop, hi-lo, and stretching.  I'm looking forward to trying some of those.",0.9682539682539683,583,0.028264097698566297,0.035586002217389175,0.09590995252249965,0.032900370843862346,0.0,0.15744028034501054,0.11553895503461085,0.0,0.051562053106424595,0.04893842801878523,0.1738082466432711,0.0,0.033980971585939185,0.24124624412740234,0.0,0.02863513723208401,0.033550426914411395,0.10384780673983571,0.03322711935375179,0.0,0.0,0.1929188416547033,0.11707228844788217,0.1307292470212011,0.031969638561545353,0.10474625833800236,0.0,0.15995756679779236,0.02770992010899627,0.09169070818663211,0.19957777952326075,0.0,0.03696504273633641,0.0,0.034360623800500124,0.10693348352471023,0.10519480692606895,0.03359613283453143,0.03225207415680122,0.23527136298491264,0.03614261195418822,0.027577132232529764,0.0,0.0,0.03532894608727563,0.03219759511863164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03197692579683297,0.13915599135125353,0.09630444156940703,0.09043827473169802,0.15626538622777572,0.1510492658439849,0.09217842450814963,0.06372169996819305,0.0,0.2299729654941431,0.055938846359187215,0.03633916114875209,0.0,0.031108397120759815,0.030753856709562363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15489685115678398,0.08673756776881142,0.0,0.0,0.1541048919506317,0.44796874645507845,0.0651336941219219,0.03430313668182796,0.0,0.08235994859252858,0.1355194705511552,0.04544290344144883,0.08788620653051969,0.23428385931681434,0.03482595135878546,0.0,0.0886844823589244,0.05713766596159479,0.18822613081203704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06639776291208957,0.028247985773703927,0.0,0.032208734226330624,0.054681411436423875,0.09053288490473302,0.02054775065807106,0.030717648941347136,0.15781884099784574,

Now, he returns to clean up the streets as Tromaville's newest mutant crime-fighter, THE TOXIC AVENGER! Troma sets the bar for the modern B-movie with this campy cult-classic, while launching themselves into low-budget independent B-movie superstardom! The virulent blend of offensive humor, outrageously over-the-top performances, and absurd splatter effects creates the formula for the perfect bad movie. Where else can you see a kid get his head crushed in while riding his bike, or watch a seeing eye dog get blasted by a shotgun? There is no line that Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman won't cross, and for that, we love them. Gary Schneider, Patrick Kilpatrick, and Dan Snow each take their comic book villains to their wildest extremes for more big laughs and mindless exploitation. THE TOXIC AVENGER single-handedly redefines bad taste, and is a must-see, must-own for all B-movie fans!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",0.0,176,0.0,0.0,0.07708468206752893,0.0,0.0,0.3220962066293663,0.0,0.06997044430762821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866284938667062,0.09205845238959683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31364420120376185,0.0,0.20555692997574296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09165972443153247,0.0,0.11883807642484896,0.17808548457255904,0.0,0.0,0.05636473263918282,0.3240223334662741,0.15552969115351162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843325449140552,0.10472302223202115,0.0,0.0,0.09118654893095937,0.0,0.2684721922432295,0.11020952439020469,0.0,0.0,0.10320232071608551,0.0,0.20094961657209698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922190873446504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19773975104415337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12385707936075355,0.4364134999103633,0.20939683406033127,0.11028037510152579,0.0,0.08825904278444575,0.0,0.04869778609177169,0.0,0.10042584783751841,0.0,0.0,0.09503657611003889,0.0,0.0,0.10671737844852054,0.0,0.10989929521842559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937696066470056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06605849695561856,0.0,0.07248117255598793,

This film has conflict, fear, death, romance, everything.  Don't rent this film, purchase it.Someone might ask, ""Yes, but is the film accurate?""  The answer is a qualified, ""yes"".  The film is so accurate that I found myself quoting lines before I saw them based upon my previous studies of Luther's life.  The special effects are very convincing, and highly accurate.However, the film does have a flaw or two.  It takes place over the period of many years, but no one seems to age!  This could give the viewer an erroneous view of history.  Also, the film paints Luther in a positive light and downplays darker aspects of Luther's character, just showing enough glimpses to hold critics at bay.If you want a great piece of entertainment that will teach a valuable history lesson at the same time, buy this film.  If this film sparks an interest to dig deeper into Luther's life, pick up the docu-drama, ""Martin Luther"".  It is a part of the PBS video series ""Empires"".  It is also sold by Amazon and will open some new questions.  It compliments this film well.",0.9090909090909091,212,0.0,0.0,0.05210024603136565,0.14297722982075547,0.11299930952601565,0.12439967623775894,0.05021049703552274,0.0,0.1680573651893024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383663252661718,0.08736659295243272,0.058550748640672515,0.0,0.0,0.0752163341921357,0.0,0.0,0.5810905825719572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058755900073227486,0.0,0.12042075861518241,0.04980826629220796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617690665254825,0.038095979113217195,0.07300042343242359,0.17519985719907433,0.17040561586867126,0.0,0.05992184695607056,0.0,0.0,0.07676562170100598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06047390240914235,0.06975272072349772,0.0,0.305591583316412,0.0,0.05007320376403722,0.0,0.0623293371727894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308407819113867,0.0,0.0,0.05609542313737169,0.06282349227322988,0.0,0.0,0.08371292628240454,0.4424468670082985,0.0,0.07453665917941261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303981281312195,0.12731088867075455,0.10181422378429729,0.0,0.07757028146028862,0.0642336306579562,0.062076695399441946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477827952699884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13114483473747612,0.0,0.0,0.048988811026043765,
308295,6302344891,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,1,1,1244246400,No Period In Baseball Like The Early 1900s!,"Grover Cleveland Alexander - the subject of this movie - was a remarkable pitcher and lived a very interesting life in an era in which baseball sported the most colorful people in its history: the early 1900s.Some of stories about them, like this one, are very inspiring, too, although they end this bio on Alexander's high note not his real-life tragic demise - but what's wrong with that? People want to leave the theater feeling good, not depressed.Ronald Reagan does a decent job portraying ""Alex,"" except for the baseball scenes where he doesn't throw or hit like a real big-leaguer. That was common in classic sports films. This is corny in spots and it's sugar-coated like some of the other classic sports stories.However, all is not sweet as Alexander is shown with his drinking problem and his wife, played by Doris Day, also walks away from her husband in his time of need.....so you do see some bad with the good.

420776,6304429150,ABHBURBXUZFF8,0,0,1355097600,A little movie masterpiece,"Lilies of the Field is a 1963 black-and-white film directed by Ralph Nelson. It stars Sidney Poitier in an Academy-winning role as a young man named Homer Smith who lives in his car and befriends a group of German immigrant nuns on the way. The mother superior believes God has sent Homer to help them build a chapel. Homer reluctantly agrees on the condition she pays him for his services. When it becomes clear to him, they are penniless and have as much power of paying him as sending him to the moon he disappears, leaving the chapel half finished. However, he returns in a week to honor his word and do all he agreed to do out of the goodness of his heart.Sidney Poitier pulls off Homer's strengths and weaknesses well and brings a considerable amount of warmth and charm to the role. Lilia Skala also gives a great performance as the Mother Abbess and her interviews with Poitier are among the film's finest moments.James Poe's screenplay does an excellent job exploring the motivations of the characters in a short and snappy but sufficient manner. No guns, no cowboys and Indians, no romance, no sci-fi creatures; just good decent ordinary people and the clash of strong personalities.Four Stars",0.0,209,0.0,0.0,0.055832168662203994,0.07660931970840715,0.12109341104398869,0.3666035507372479,0.10761411519679603,0.20271740341514424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04681231591714317,0.06274471854578788,0.0,0.1562459823956168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12454278006535352,0.0,0.045434282069659535,0.0,0.0,0.06097605731678576,0.06296456490460942,0.0,0.06452322798423825,0.053376015205846665,0.19916646433759547,0.08016479767292657,0.34429603124686015,0.2579734013103955,0.0,0.0,0.16329912376386457,0.0,0.03754987249328493,0.07304468451407055,0.0,0.06421402816002043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07445905528808326,0.0,0.2989963360815904,0.0,0.2910942247963065,0.10049197624705081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06512748724304881,0.0846166271982744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523030013843451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4109206255238436,0.0,0.07987569433581615,0.0,0.0,0.06311208159590892,0.0,0.0,0.21821428294653547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180979174970082,0.0,0.06941832531887555,0.0,0.0,0.06791700183854658,0.0,0.06366350322798012,0.0,0.04784594091426361,0.0,0.0,

The live show - Live @ The Download Festival in 2009 - is fantastic. Possibly the best audio I've ever heard on a standard-DVD concert from Slipknot. The set-list has material from all 4 albums, so the mix of songs goes from about as hardcore as Slipknot gets to some ballad-type songs. All in all, there's 17 songs performed in front of 80,000 people, and it makes the DVD worth the purchase if you are a fan.The 'Full-length Film', ""Audible Visions,"" is actually only about 35 minutes long, with abstract clips from on-stage clips to backstage shots. Anyone who is familiar with Clown's style of film will already know that you are in for a lot of abstract moments woven together to make a chaotic atmosphere. The film isn't bad, it's just not amazing or anything. Nevertheless, with the live show included, I consider the ""movie"" an extra feature, as well as the videos from the album ""All Hope Is Gone"". I wasn't as into ""All Hope Is Gone"" as much as other Slipknot fans, so the videos weren't anything too special to me, but for fans who love that album, there's another incentive to buy this.Overall, I'm glad I bought this DVD. And for other reviewers that are giving this release 1 star reviews because it isn't available on blu-ray, that's really not what your review should be about. It should be about the material contained within the release. On that basis, I give ""(sic)nesses"" 4 stars.R.I.P.

676318,B00005QX8G,A29ZCVZWIWZBCH,2,2,1098921600,Excellent musical stage show,"Madonna put on a terrific show during 2001's Drowned World tour, and this DVD captures the best parts of the show for everyone to enjoy over and over. This was the first music DVD I bought after I got my first DVD player early in 2002, so I've watched this video lots of times. I particularly like Madonna's performance in the opening song Drowned World/Substitute For Love. Also really good is this version of Beautiful Stranger (her 1999 hit from the Austin Powers movie), the costume she wears in Frozen with ultra-long black drapes stretched out to either side, the leaping martial arts simulated combat in Sky Fits Heaven (this is brilliantly done), her great vocal performance on the song Gone (from the Music album), and her hugely-enjoyable old favourites from the 80's La Isla Bonita (done with acoustic guitars), and of course Holiday (performed here with cool rap intro and terrific backbeats courtesy of the Stardust hit Music Sounds Better) . And on the finale, Music really does sound better, as her 2000 title track rocks out as a delirious home crowd parties on (this show was filmed in her home city of Detroit). Madonna even plays some acoustic guitar and shows off her cowgirl persona from the Don't Tell Me video on a couple of tracks mid-show.This concert is great entertainment value, and is full of colour, movement and strong songs. If you only buy one Madonna video, then this is the one to own.5 stars.",1.0,248,0.0,0.07282982805180165,0.0,0.06733345141613378,0.0,0.2636305658591578,0.0,0.08908617441071263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954499419515514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084450286769574,0.2040065114148674,0.06487569895988779,0.0,0.13160835900058018,0.07986618432348813,0.21403895888576385,0.0,0.05359306685550189,0.11068161127339347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42275058934913173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05471215318392251,0.17940855071717765,0.0,0.16501664058838758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053685980409686515,0.06666652981623043,0.0,0.06589516017693069,0.0,0.0,0.04272725573503193,0.0,0.0,0.05695895178434765,0.0,0.0,0.2558484909857289,0.22081098050788164,0.09432555483478879,0.06520598216542906,0.0,0.0,0.11448368200699371,0.0,0.0,0.12733204474230034,0.0,0.0,0.0749106022008442,0.30561944289043425,0.05283496474540558,0.059171975426779586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3889483150641639,0.0,0.0,0.07203022559079066,0.0,0.0,0.2480075413620997,0.0,0.09589643188983042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856046752949763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261582409400863,0.0,0.046141413304644024,
884746,B0007OCG56,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,4,7,1118102400,A drama that's more realistic than some can admit,"As a poor white guy who can sometimes cook and has dated women from many cultures, I can relate a bit to ""John,"" Sandler's character.  Still, as others have indicated, the man is far too saintly to be realistic.  Any other guy would have blown his top at his wife's hysterics.Two of the biggest criticisms of ""Spanglish,"" besides Sandler's character being too nice, is that Brooks, the director, is sexist for depicting an accomplished white woman, played by Leoni, as completely hysterical and racist because of how he handles the issue of Hispanic culture and American ideals.I've known a few ultra-rich liberal white families.  ""Deborah,"" Leoni's character is, unfortunately, not that unrealistic.  I have personally witnessed a liberal white woman mistreat a Hispanic employee.  And I've known more than one woman who could compete with Deborah's selfishness.  I have also seen the mellow rich white guy who's clueless to his wife's rude behavior towards the Hispanic help.  The only mistake Brooks made, in my experience, was in making Leoni's character too much of a caricature.The issue of racism is a bit more complicated.  It should be obvious why Flor would want to keep her cultural identity and why should would want to pass this on to her daughter.  But would she deny her the chance of a lifetime to receive a top education?  It's a hard path to follow.  It seems like Brooks had the right intention (honoring cultural independence), he just couldn't figure out a way to show it in a way that was appropriate.*spoiler alert*Unlike viewers who applaud the ""family values"" ending, I can't say I enjoyed the last five minutes.  Staying married for the sake of being married is just stupid.  It's so obvious that Flor and John belong together and that Deborah should be dumped in a heartbeat.  Deborah is, quite bluntly, not just a lousy wife but also a horrible parent.  All of the kids would be better off with Flor and John together.I applaud Brooks for his bravery in depicting (finally!) a father figure who is loving, supportive and, most importantly, non-traditional (egalitarian).  Funny how some liberal critics missed that point.  Flor and John are the ideal parents while Deborah, the clueless perfectionist, represents any bad parent, male or female.",0.5714285714285714,376,0.0,0.0,0.042530636846667226,0.11671562232524144,0.04612197603137829,0.25387583826024124,0.040987990997640666,0.11581630008828624,0.04572970579301378,0.17361138903080528,0.06165929791035432,0.0,0.0,0.07131937218019152,0.04779633144223109,0.15237675640219417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382987070329502,0.04637681895624027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05674570369749666,0.04915112637260085,0.16263856292430384,0.10114451661999485,0.18319868166012257,0.0,0.19651346723809784,0.12189593878413772,0.0,0.15549314796009137,0.0,0.22883151830448958,0.13910604876568108,0.0,0.14674677220540994,0.04652956652208597,0.0,0.06266555395743384,0.0,0.10062237772443619,0.060213669827290504,0.0,0.0,0.05671982866299029,0.049366246380403336,0.0,0.08020851472636562,0.24946148326447154,0.0382753155589005,0.04087591532207618,0.05651393644395212,0.05088088072738602,0.058274284056409324,0.04961142608356489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492491748711371,0.06621998932447339,0.04579199239825843,0.05128427097452822,0.0,0.056797546916685746,0.20501039850821492,0.3852582605381578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026868475032321266,0.0,0.24933992298165086,0.18532006547279628,0.06332241634511956,0.0,0.0,0.07419345615639522,0.0,0.12463863134026602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24248111805916767,0.0,0.07289411772354085,0.27243078273891697,0.0,
974113,B000EMG918,A1N2D7LLBAY25B,2,7,1154649600,Tom Baker as Tom Baker,"The darkness of this story is looming over all others.  Tom Baker(though quite silly and quirky as usual) is more like his real self and perfect for the role in this one.  From landing as in ""arriving"" late and the Time Lord(evil wizardly type guy) giving Doc a ring and his light-heartedness goes from empting his junky 10-year-old toy pockets and saying ""boy soldiers and very young generals"" to battling with himself(of all people) about killing a race(Xenocide) and seeing Davros go from a ""sit down and talk reasonably"" scientist to a mad megalomanic slayer of madness and distruction.  The Daleks are not much until the last chapter where they realize thier true power and capabilities.  The story revovles around The Director Davros and his minion scientists and soldiers one in particular, Nydar, Played by Peter Miles who is also a comentator on this DVD.  He stands out from other characters with his sharp calasue voice.  I once mistakeningly took him for the voice of Jarl the 1st Cyberman in the Hartnel Episode he sounds exactly the same, but he is not.  He is like Davros in Human form.  Micheal Wisher takes on the role of the mad wizard-science guy himself.  He was also in Carnival Of Monsters to get an idea of his voice acting quality.  Tom Baker(surprisingly) still does these commentaries.  He and Elizebeth Sladen do most if not all of the ones she was in.(He doesn't work with Lalla of course).  Liz is still young enough to put two sentences together co-herently but Tom is and never was able to do this.(must have ADHD).  Think Syd Barret of Pink Floyd as in low functioning yet brilliant.  Back on topic, Genisis of the Daleks is to Tom Baker as Inferno was to Jon Pertwee and Caves of Anderzoni was to Peter Davison if you get a Dr. Who get these, they are the most belevavle.  Hand of Fear and Seeds of Doom are also good.  Seeds NEEDS to be released now!  I am also surprised that the E-space sequence and Logopolis, antoher epich great of Baker is not released.",0.2857142857142857,351,0.043198236731034304,0.0,0.10994002563204136,0.20113686605662665,0.03974116545186784,0.37188013942930903,0.10595234670791465,0.13305803841247418,0.0,0.03739821842795644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06145259187958586,0.041183879774486225,0.0,0.10255549635674555,0.0,0.050783611882522964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059643586066338856,0.15984300707475024,0.14658511616211534,0.040022979971200585,0.04132818078053756,0.0,0.0,0.035034524722181694,0.3050303695538567,0.0,0.05649657328272183,0.25398979685030015,0.0,0.08171741382016426,0.21436996248416262,0.0,0.22182018234156126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018473450920141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04335081565658213,0.10376664752795867,0.0,0.0,0.04887284304046181,0.0,0.0,0.1382239066348961,0.3582489640635005,0.09894018725350308,0.0704417569926318,0.0,0.0,0.05021224508462804,0.04274786255794221,0.05553998937636792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055942787144437706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923611826754299,0.0,0.02944132373732,0.35270660410966603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08285001322833936,0.09260527007536803,0.044774460230873774,0.214844635586045,0.0,0.05456198630933322,0.0,0.04366398755748949,0.15982264151861253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835738887265998,0.0,0.09421421550591137,0.0,0.03445812992030836,

219973,6300216047,AHJ5MWFXGGQ3T,10,14,1074297600,Redefining camp for the 41st century,"Barbarella is a bad film on so many levels that I cannot even begin to pick it apart. But in an age when the recent Charlie's Angels movies are considered ""empowering"" for women and video game heroines offer more than any human vixen can, Barbarella looks almost classy. It is a movie that makes no apologies; everything is gratuitious and no one tries to justify its atrocities of political incorrectness. To those who were not around when it was originally released (myself being 16 years too late), picture an Austin Powers movie but replace Mike Myers with--all right, Jane Fonda has no modern equivalent--but it's the same kind of camp without the irony. I wish movies like this could be made today without the pretense of insisting that scantily clad heroines are ""positive female role models."" It's so sleazy and witty at the same time. It's truly awful and yet that's what makes it endearing.",0.7142857142857143,155,0.0,0.0,0.08419757980473455,0.0,0.18261465360391538,0.20103843005666708,0.16228723099075928,0.0,0.09053075238058722,0.08592428815275023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21178563181693089,0.0,0.10055303704805055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113135133126347,0.09390823350512997,0.0,0.06851706967672652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09730411280154497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061565721583993226,0.0,0.16988100919235327,0.38554206837517757,0.12691573186423696,0.0,0.09211423061091628,0.0,0.124058522785849,0.0,0.0996006797304665,0.0,0.1466225728994304,0.24075795543807355,0.0,0.0,0.33817557787606395,0.07939409470918374,0.16461900332453097,0.07577335246449426,0.08092174012888721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813081214029501,0.0,0.0,0.11244167366860262,0.2705716893201344,0.23834151935903708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05319131662479825,0.10287157475623307,0.16453878600063823,0.12229224357583783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344011175095629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657874484579721,0.09919354452590257,0.2048441720756756,0.0,0.09600760676372466,0.0,0.07215396652124774,0.0,0.0,

1128510,B0010ZR160,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,1,1,1279065600,...but the Afflecks are here!,"If there is any doubt about Ben Affleck's talent or ability, his film, ""Gone Baby Gone"" erases that doubt. In his directorial debut, he shows he still has the stuff we first saw in his joint work with Matt Damon in their Academy Award winning ""Good Will Hunting.""Now add Casey Affleck to this list of talented guys from Boston, for he shines in this, his brother's loose adaptation of Dennis Lehane's book of the same title.The basic premise: A young girl is taken from her mother, people want to exchange the young girl for money, money gets shuffled around, and only a few really know what's going on. You, viewer, are not the privileged few. You must hang with Casey Affleck's private detective, first-person narrative to learn anything. This performance, although much lower-keyed and diametrically opposite, is as perfectly rendered as the role of serial killer he plays in the recently-releasedThe Killer Inside Me. The two years between roles wrought subtle, yet incredible changes in Affleck's appearance.  In ""Baby"" he had a softer look, a much gentler nature that reeks of sincerity. In ""Killer"" he looks taller, more wired, and, although affable, like a conductor coil about to be fired. The biggest difference, however, is that his ""Baby"" character follows not only the law, but the letter of the law! No moral dilemmas with his mindset. In ""Killer"" Affleck's character does what he wants. He is his own moral law. What the two roles do have in common is the narrative line. However, to hear a killer devoid of a moral compass wax on is quite different from hearing the voice of a person committed to truth, justice, and the American Way. In fact, it's this tight connection to Right that determines the painful and just or unjust ending to ""Baby.""A fine cast of actors fleshes out this convoluted, morally twisted story: Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, each contributing or part of the dilemma at movie's end.In fact, this movie raises as much controversy in its conclusion as didThe Deep End of the Ocean. What IS the right thing to do? I do not want to say anything more except: Let the story lead where the story leads.",1.0,369,0.08536848058436515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807508955491331,0.0348972224226013,0.1314748405071885,0.038934323823550665,0.03695323380483271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030360697529133458,0.0,0.0,0.15200285177255324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040386868294384815,0.09711488973160673,0.058933913793618044,0.11845583013291293,0.0,0.03954676448801971,0.0,0.04831335704090882,0.0418473252188615,0.03461766463003985,0.3444582286082406,0.051991855710360184,0.0,0.29279563390576113,0.0,0.04037254748698741,0.3442063145190961,0.0,0.19482741645066226,0.023687009809212768,0.054582316757203084,0.04164678990768925,0.039615326163263846,0.0,0.0,0.048624580254822386,0.0856700074990935,0.0,0.06305758632281852,0.0,0.14487398102079294,0.0,0.04847942867299977,0.10243443178589519,0.25958996826489816,0.06517529490191837,0.0,0.09623206027223304,0.12996012016570738,0.0,0.042239224919324886,0.05487914395966583,0.0,0.046979681147737734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13689332759811332,0.0,0.11636405853768435,0.4510128201273119,0.04918222192457712,0.0,0.0,0.0414598038079668,0.0,0.13725510226832,0.0,0.2358758840587616,0.0,0.10782555542472914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053058736650208535,0.051625341434053514,0.0,0.0,0.17063963270918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04557404066495463,0.09309320282289929,0.0,0.06809625618265239,

But contrary to the review which states that this DVD does not  work on just some computer DVD players, I feel it necessary to let the  world know that the final third of this DVD does not play, period.  When  the first copy I bought was totally scrambled and unwatchable after the  first two thirds, I sent it back for a replacement, which had exactly the  same problem at exactly the same spot.  This is a serious manufacturing  defect in what I can only assume is every copy that has been produced, and  my repeated inquiries to MGM's DVD department concerning this problem have  been thoroughly ignored and completely unanswered.  Just be warned about  what you're getting into if you plan to buy this otherwise excellent movie  on DVD.  I am hoping that this review will damage sales enough to pressure  MGM into facing this gargantuan defect and replacing all the scrambled  copies that currently reside uselessly in the consumers' hands.",0.0,191,0.07256885552960893,0.09136804865775186,0.0615628664559313,0.0,0.0,0.14699356027562127,0.05932989494565726,0.11176231134997998,0.0661935014270764,0.06282538630132065,0.08925149972963742,0.17068535010227004,0.0,0.05161720245430617,0.0,0.0735215098329864,0.0,0.0,0.426557757081663,0.0,0.06866301919599405,0.24766224095117342,0.05009772513939723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213909872244446,0.07114598918290456,0.05885460971340999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06863867192880654,0.09003019575926803,0.17251800754611263,0.08280809580324455,0.12081315124786281,0.0,0.14161010524704543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053603119565706986,0.08801767160772792,0.0,0.07145737422893829,0.0,0.11610139059356184,0.16048628699747555,0.11080662388415975,0.0,0.08180361687837379,0.0,0.08435171051196846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423370443939352,0.0,0.0,0.24729286778493767,0.38339073111973193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31113577654672464,0.0,0.20051010438522435,0.0,0.18331770931038643,0.0,0.0,0.053697312947925846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450549754304275,0.07488810509171848,0.16539363865705292,0.0,0.07748189847767593,0.0,0.0,0.11577264449828298,

Sewell, the only one taking his part seriously) driving a black limo all the time, a priest-turned-cop (or visa versa), some punksters-demons in disguise, swarms of second-best sfx-generated rats and other horny creatures, and the fire-blasting, demon summoning finale in a decaying church. Yes, and don't forget the warrior-mother - K. Basinger! I wonder what lured her into this devilish soup. Her whispering performance suffers even more from too much applied make-up and awkward stunt tricks. And imagine someone calling this movie a masterpice (he/she must be under an evil spell)!Why do I give this nonsense 3 stars then? First of all, because I have a weakness towards all Satan-summoning movies, just to observe what ridiculous ideas and creatures will materialize this time (and that's the constant source of amusement). Second, I enjoy watching those white dazzling flying lights appearing in the end of such movies (contrary to Devil's depiction, angels or whomever these lights represent, stay boringly monotonous). Third, when watching this flick, I advise you to play a game &quot;spot another clich&eacute; &quot; (and I bet you'll be head over heels into the game). I only waited in vain who of the characters will be the first to glitter a red &quot;demonic&quot; eye. It's ridiculous drivel, but funny in its absurdity, for which I'm adding one more star. Watch it once (but NEVER BUY IT!) and I bet you'll be amused (if not laughing out heartily).",0.3333333333333333,331,0.0,0.0,0.07988054028727923,0.0,0.028875250389391902,0.20662486165753305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13586452598280027,0.03860258859647095,0.0,0.03773565097094209,0.06697560164972792,0.029923501914788722,0.03179913621251704,0.037257533874993774,0.038440774413228906,0.0,0.03520205531366319,0.0,0.07141171205173986,0.02166800422439342,0.029034798047548358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025455485819900394,0.03166140627766469,0.07646257827784944,0.0,0.061514879235954396,0.0,0.029687236878956393,0.11681815830599554,0.11192487001830201,0.0,0.06967129051114886,0.0401361387337669,0.03062422844721903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06299592085110059,0.0,0.06955241687872651,0.07613787951092854,0.035510170977345025,0.0,0.0,0.02510778099044755,0.121472196315292,0.047925497370031565,0.1023635491261287,0.07076253906376838,0.09556386981575848,0.03648335757007857,0.031059865027533495,0.0,0.828135133415805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040647071315322254,0.04145786752992003,0.0,0.03210717087271928,0.0,0.0,0.04278312349646033,0.2110463597395741,0.03616527475703452,0.0,0.03908415672053726,0.0,0.060197401096104275,0.10092810554494577,0.06506471239663078,0.10406828917114093,0.038673995588458174,0.0,0.03282784959391608,0.0,0.0,0.036862671112106636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06273841400283597,0.09717062638886709,0.03576759275133765,0.060723356639313775,0.06702412530137108,0.02281814529964049,0.0,0.10014674890238642,

When the album is played Heidi gets flashback of the midevil witch trail. Heidi finds comfort in three old ladies one played by Dee Wallace, but what Heidi doesn't realize is that the old ladies will have her hook up with SATAN! Lords of Salem is no Devil's Reject or House of 1000 Corpses, but it's a weird and bizarre movie, instead lots of gore Lords of Salem gives more hardcore sex towards religion which I like. The movie got such a fall/halloween feel to it, and I like how Rob filmed this movie in a location where there's lots of old houses. Regardless of the negative reviews I still found this movie enjoyable!",0.7142857142857143,135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12322501351187636,0.0,0.0,0.11098030542910356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17308324141413486,0.23199149742440917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09867588843446705,0.0,0.14820013448060562,0.0,0.0,0.14791313744793022,0.0,0.150945008313437,0.0,0.27767280975069736,0.135037228089139,0.0,0.0,0.22584293577037562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209899472572788,0.0,0.3594848710584468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13818814025231724,0.0,0.47087598234431716,0.0,0.09920075995396467,0.0,0.1234815659909572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292245433623519,0.35061519652949946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181790573914031,0.0,0.13041289086783514,0.0,0.06723521840224393,0.0,0.0,0.12725418980376793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215998937223087,0.12555771483461775,0.13864983826556004,0.0,0.12990647983401388,0.0884524764445291,0.0,0.0,

Not as fresh as the first ""Terminator,"" but still memorable.*Good continuing story.  Much more complex than the first film.*Stronger focus on the destructive nature of humanity.*Great lines.*Still good characters.  Still great acting.  In fact, the terminator is a stronger character in this one.*Even though much of it is serious, there is also quite a bit of comedy throughout.  There is also less violence, making the film a little less stark or brutal.*Good music.The Bad Things*Ummmm....While not as fresh, original, or serious as the first film, this sequel is just as essential.  The action and special effects are much more enjoyable.  The story and characters continue to be great, if not better.  On top of it all, it is as thought-provoking as the first, if not moreso.  Many people may say that sequels are all bad, but I always refer to this one as one shining example of how great a sequel can be.  Anybody who has seen the ""Terminator"" must see this one as well.",1.0,180,0.0,0.0,0.10173266704429665,0.139591038663369,0.0,0.09109009894714772,0.0980426805272341,0.415546367351442,0.0,0.10381898170866909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08529745239853198,0.0,0.06074716554814163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724789841719638,0.17019850939987902,0.2728413165119674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777635673715938,0.28682179425021703,0.0,0.05878439102785008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728933298076772,0.1134254390622714,0.07438747134741347,0.0,0.20526062845743406,0.09982189587670615,0.0,0.05850269211196506,0.0,0.0,0.07494754850346885,0.0,0.12034363472090444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2035095123893158,0.0,0.0,0.19185760495882007,0.2320532095509181,0.09155400018596571,0.19554919427064726,0.0,0.12170632940722946,0.0,0.0,0.07709063938797761,0.0,0.0,0.06524186036330186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12819920758048084,0.06792945459810104,0.04086515854293933,0.3455745662241173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11648005248789349,0.0,0.12853800587589043,0.0,0.0662686091884336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324410770397482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05800113207092768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

633732,B00005JNQA,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,5,9,1114300800,"Hard to ""Interpret""","There's obviously a portion of the movie-going public that enjoys stressful  ""thrillers"".  And yes, they can be good movies if done properly.  There's a fine line between ""thriller"" and ""horror""; Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is a good example of a film that dances along that line.  Some movies go too far toward the horror side, and are failures.  Another way a thriller can be brought down is when in an attempt to be, y'know, thrilling, it's just hard to follow.  Sydney Pollack's ""The Interpreter"" winds up doing the latter.Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is a foreign language specialist at the United Nations who overhears a whispered plot to assassinate the corrupt leader of the small African nation where she used to live.  In typical government fashion, rather than believing her when she notifies the authorities, Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) instead ""investigates"" Silvia, which makes very little sense.  Why would someone connected with an assassination go to the authorities about it?At any rate, after a couple tense scenes where the Bad Guys try to silence Silvia, Agent Keller changes his mind and decides to protect her by doing really helpful things like watching her apartment from across the street.From the trailers, this movie looked like it had real promise, but it just never really worked.  If there is one thing that is to blame, it probably has to be poor editing.  It's not that the editing was sloppy (though I don't even want to talk about Nicole Kidman's magically switching hairstyles), but some techniques that were probably meant to be artistic or interesting were just plain confusing.  There would be two different scenes going on, and the picture apparently randomly cut between them, paying no heed to what the audio was doing.  We'd be looking at one person doing something, and hear the voice of someone who was in an entirely different place.  That's not artistic, it's just stupid.Another editing-related problem was that the film was just plain-and-simple too long.  There were a couple scenes (including a very climactic, tense scene) that seemed too long.  Even that tense scene went on so long that I didn't care how it ended as long as it just ENDED.But the kiss of death for this movie, pushing it into two-star territory, was that it phoned ahead on a few things.  This is absolutely the worst possible thing you can do to a thriller.  The whole point is that the audience has no idea what's going to happen next, and if they've been tipped off, you've already lost it.Without a doubt, the saving grace of this film is Sean Penn.  The guy doesn't win an Academy Award for nothing, you know.  His character is definitely the most likable in the film, and he plays it brilliantly.  There's the right combination of toughness and sensitivity for him to be conceivable as a competent Secret Service agent and a caring person.",0.5555555555555556,486,0.06963817781213814,0.04383908477225852,0.0,0.0,0.12813033844090013,0.1939537280543519,0.028466934910633984,0.08043661072321096,0.09528043653325909,0.24115278602306559,0.0,0.04094806468147765,0.0,0.07429897915114902,0.03319545610838551,0.1058285390626849,0.0413314201651914,0.04264404090939764,0.0,0.07810237487692896,0.13178015568780616,0.0,0.07211180882860002,0.06441915568223587,0.0,0.06451947131915672,0.0,0.039410964389734134,0.06827277361867835,0.0,0.035123389816235036,0.12723494905697758,0.04553795147397995,0.0682411597247099,0.042329517387646697,0.09880007075384432,0.08639434554934478,0.041387726172663,0.17879379425138744,0.2511906322488886,0.0,0.20383681712809473,0.06463132782870373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041819532452872614,0.07715755356123061,0.08446309675544598,0.0,0.0,0.0790928701331374,0.05570633037675614,0.13475444727879987,0.0797487915493527,0.0567781924687701,0.0,0.03533773392176266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07664607281116094,0.0,0.0,0.09018316610298535,0.0,0.03180340473638983,0.07123579215459695,0.0,0.03944697048591725,0.3084977976384248,0.4515229371286878,0.0,0.04225869789369549,0.0,0.2029216289107291,0.06677962330795989,0.07464265618064672,0.0,0.288618820024208,0.12870829023438077,0.08795723140391752,0.03641737666369042,0.07038899639463682,0.15458627533030242,0.0,0.04328194331259235,0.04211267064597829,0.0,0.1226950335363482,0.0695984806280841,0.07186376497646943,0.039678562979048974,0.06736308891299807,0.0,0.025313171664397664,0.07568333232363815,0.08332289324926125,

639938,B00005JOC9,ANJECC80HOKTM,1,2,1167955200,The Da Vinci Code Decoded,"As many of you are reading these reviews you will probably see mediocre to negative reviews for ""The Da Vinci Code"" film. This movie was destroyed by critics long before the film reached the average theatre and many refuse to see it because of the enormous ""controversy"". If you will honestly be offended by any subject about Jesus (GASP!) then by all means stay away, but let me inform you that the film in no way forces religion down your throat and the film is...well..Fiction...The other crowd of doubters may say the film will stray from the beloved book, but I think this is what critics hated about the film... The Da Vinci Code is almost an exact translation from book to film! The plot remains intact and I think people were upset there wasn't much creative input from the minds of Hanks or Howard. The plot, for those who don't already know, follows a symbologist named Robert Langdon (played fantastically by Mr. Hanks) who is asked to help solve a murder scene involving symbols. When he arrives, a young female detective, Sophie Neveu, informs him that he is a suspect, and he agrees to help her follow the clues left on the dead body he had been asked to inspect. The clues lead them on an age old quest for the holy grail, previously hidden by the Knights Templar. This quest becomes more dangerous than expected when a secret Catholic Brotherhood sends an albino monk(a creepy Paul Bettany)to kill Langdon and Nevue for the location of the grail. The grail in the book and movie is a secret so great it would destroy the foundations of the Catholic Church, and the Church will make sure the grail is not found. A suspenseful cat and mouse chase follows between the French Police, the albino, Langdon and Neveu, and Langdon's cripple friend Leigh Teabing(a typical Ian McKellen). With historic locations such as the Lovre as a backdrop, some jump-out-of-your-seat suspense, a few puzzle solving segments, and tons of making-of featurettes, This is a good DVD that will top any other thriller you could watch come Friday night.",0.5,356,0.08596557534774966,0.0,0.036463901740750884,0.0,0.11862887509730997,0.2394282037076381,0.035141304882808706,0.09929581354781705,0.0,0.037211696673609955,0.05286397634986342,0.05054876578213001,0.0,0.06114610013403388,0.20489238611230065,0.0,0.0,0.052642381335979774,0.05053033114406677,0.0,0.2846854297931018,0.0,0.11869223329461302,0.1192843485202682,0.0,0.03982336734920408,0.04112205853442083,0.04865127628573062,0.0,0.0,0.17343374043251575,0.05235550356458925,0.05621479943342584,0.0,0.0,0.04065492614154423,0.053325200739580386,0.0,0.19619010241309381,0.04770536883351064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10745339225799291,0.04896467629545922,0.043134605619620264,0.0,0.06349863147586904,0.0,0.048629092166570104,0.0,0.048818509476527897,0.03438363044383794,0.2138773291040072,0.06563115199368796,0.0,0.0,0.04362303442610347,0.09992362801931694,0.042534659719570926,0.055262986441727564,0.0,0.0,0.09353820576178824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03926004487878134,0.04396888352279112,0.0,0.04869572438692531,0.08788345979848079,0.61931911317198,0.0,0.052166690628786996,0.05352345559327916,0.04174978708487685,0.0,0.09214340589674516,0.0,0.16626797339577984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03180510680861698,0.05048126161263055,0.053429846614785316,0.0,0.04533699933365681,0.050487388200179395,0.042958285372306164,0.08871297464909894,0.0,0.08315706811326304,0.22946400122541785,0.03124810893065908,0.04671403971100497,0.17143135855581776,
172003,1415743762,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,35,53,1212364800,Heads will roll...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of ""The Tudors,"" but the second season was rather disappointing. The problem is that everything happens so darn FAST! In Season 2, Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) marries Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer), who gives birth to Princess Elizabeth, the child who eventually will become Queen of England. However, Season 2 also depicts Henry forcing everyone in England to take ""The Great Oath"" promising to support Elizabeth's right to the throne. Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) is murdered, Katharine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) dies, Henry is excommunicated by the Pope (Peter O'Toole), Anne has a bunch of miscarriages and falls out of Henry's good graces, Henry starts screwing around on Anne and eventually becomes obsessed with Jane Seymour (Anita Briem), the entire Boleyn family is brought down, and Anne loses her head. (And no, I am not spoiling anything for people who haven't watched all the episodes yet...anyone who has even a mediocre grasp of history knows what happens in this story!)The fact that ""The Tudors"" has only aired for two seasons and the character of Anne Boleyn is already dead depresses the hell out of me. Why does Showtime feel the need to rush everything? The series is based on such vivid historical characters, and ""The Tudors"" would be a much better program if the writers just slowed everything down and spent more time allowing the events to unfold. This season spanned at least five years (of course, none of the characters appear to have aged a day...imagine that!). I'm especially disappointed that Dormer will most likely not return next season, because she was the best part of the show. Also, the character of Anne was generally portrayed as an innocent victim in the series, but the character of Henry becomes darker and more sinister with each passing episode. There is nothing likeable or redeeming about him at all anymore, which is unfortunate, as he is the central focus of the series.Where will ""The Tudors"" go from here? At this rate, Henry should be dead by the end of Season 3 and Elizabeth should be on the throne early into Season 4. Unless the show slows down a bit, though, I honestly don't think it will last much longer. Viewers who are truly interested in the Tudor period simply won't stand for much more of this crap.",0.660377358490566,394,0.04108187458023927,0.0,0.06970257254534432,0.09564139800715978,0.03779417166796664,0.18723231429472603,0.03358718123950271,0.06326963852701498,0.11241818975129825,0.10669802995995434,0.050526067845939784,0.0,0.04939135251004458,0.05844191483894695,0.07833240945261083,0.0,0.0,0.050314272867981485,0.0,0.046075185622584724,0.0,0.046734599146166865,0.08508230338945963,0.038003000041756343,0.0,0.03806217956861784,0.03930343615705371,0.0,0.12082913185698257,0.0333181180420949,0.04144090901275458,0.050040082261417186,0.053728700832518995,0.0,0.0,0.038856962686739736,0.1274172364860971,0.04883198926811271,0.21095279807509024,0.022797799832018947,0.0,0.04008337006692873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04679921427373375,0.16490791351910247,0.04934146300805997,0.0,0.0,0.13943541404264387,0.0,0.04665951168001904,0.06572602988082128,0.3634108580691905,0.09409292302835345,0.0,0.04630975511851794,0.041693806430146925,0.0,0.08130713015501548,0.05281898175507169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16673166909790996,0.0532020457095584,0.1085265576079124,0.0375237700253903,0.0,0.04391811807481303,0.0,0.11199575360295888,0.631391717708511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039903403422460834,0.0,0.08806836525279547,0.0425808759523094,0.15891477494624348,0.0,0.05188889288155652,0.0,0.0,0.0911955794144699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041058455892563434,0.0,0.04681540497015385,0.19869862028317792,0.1754527675691384,0.059732323631454434,0.044648112056032654,0.0,
1379592,B0040QYRSG,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,2,2,1361318400,Genuinely frightening,"""The Possession of David O Reilly"" has to be one of the most effective low budget movies I have ever seen.  Giles Anderson, director of ""Taken"" and a few other blockbuster films gives one of the most convincing (and brave) performances from a male actor that one could hope for.  If you've ever wondered why films about demonic possession almost always feature young girls as the vulnerable, soon-to-be-possessed vessels of the demonic, this movie is your antidote.David, a tall and looming young man, shows up at his two friend's houses (Alex and Kate) distressed about recent (perceived? real?) developments in his relationship with a girl named Sarah.  He has, apparently, discovered photos of her naked with another man.  The couple are sympathetic to him and offer him a room for the night to recover from his romantic fallout.  Big mistake.For reasons that are never made clear to the viewer, David notices a slight sound in his room and says emphatically, ""Not here, please.""  This is the start of either some vicious possession or, most likely, the most convincing nervous breakdown I have ever seen on camera, as David finds himself unable to sleep and is absolutely convinced that he and his friends are under attack from some invisible entity.  The power of suggestion (or a real presence?) is enough to make his friend Alex follow his lead in absolute panic, turning off the lights and even allowing David to run amuck with a large butcher knife in his hand.  While some of this sounds unrealistic (why don't they subdue and drive him to the nearest psychiatric hospital?) you can actually see it occurring if two people were unprepared for a seemingly normal man to lose his s*** in the scariest way possible.  If he never had problems like this before, where is it coming from and why?  The viewer runs from room to room with David and the hapless couple, seeing either his hallucinations or what is actually a demonic presence.  Needless to say, really, this does not end well.  David's notebooks, filled with scrawls of demons and other languages, suggests that this might have been going on for longer than one night.This is like a hyper caffeinated madcap rush of ""Paranormal Activity"" without the pacing.  In contrast to most viewers, I found this viscerally terrifying and would recommend it to any fan of the horror genre.",1.0,397,0.08165248362974545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894379562190504,0.10013455304861904,0.06287594196799325,0.03723955512475074,0.07068939959247367,0.0,0.04801261730445979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04136219204685342,0.0,0.05000119132430637,0.0,0.04578848188192476,0.0,0.0,0.14092146183024434,0.1888326281661033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046210329244202875,0.08005151348582207,0.0993323862093674,0.12354912644589962,0.049728706874136094,0.16018311883283576,0.40007222707121814,0.0,0.11584552343699918,0.15194925629804873,0.0,0.16305344235993352,0.06796782023453002,0.0,0.0,0.0757818283490768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24517217396350383,0.03015637914433129,0.049517533641866465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531704837871913,0.27086214519078455,0.06233828532046489,0.13314766631572325,0.0,0.12430309772074863,0.09491022851957949,0.0,0.05249031461152345,0.0,0.044934706809680106,0.04442258883177537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528858886385155,0.0,0.046252547281370564,0.11129885784308025,0.3529478646211654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039150378931966656,0.1750407162666637,0.0,0.3158518493229686,0.0,0.1031320264683071,0.04270027369027387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05074914764899286,0.0,0.043062337231365926,0.04795431917773659,0.04080296885043744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14840159520830415,0.04437028830845788,0.06513210033890783,

Their minds create a hallucinatory nightmare that drives them to murder and madness as they attempt to escape from their own personal hells. HORROR adheres to a surreal dream-logic, where scenes bleed into one another and dreams blur into reality without ever distinguishing between the two. Director Dante Tomaselli focuses entirely on creating a frightening aesthetic, atmosphere, and mood, rather than establishing a linear story structure. Backlighting, fog effects, color filters, high- and low-angle shooting, each of these techniques are combined to heighten the constant state of unease and terror. HORROR also introduces a number of truly disturbing images that are accompanied by an unsettling score. The performances by the untrained cast are also forgivable given the size of the picture and the minimal dialog. Tomaselli comes through with this twisted vision of hell from the same vein of Horror as the works of Jim Ven Bebber.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",1.0,179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22055298809489982,0.1743098212202552,0.335817532670595,0.23236025419147685,0.145902382478482,0.08641365274345657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27095662541684884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540109421772,0.17527295481717042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22521714178402302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792511856390214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149044595862185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3666426530924396,0.07232738041927973,0.07724163300329942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10127698229776527,0.1073281231712731,0.12913340156959852,0.40950427720935423,0.21831715715947614,0.11497832854392152,0.0,0.0,0.18169536335589345,0.05077231595799921,0.0,0.26175999393214583,0.0,0.11965791605332603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776419993646293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06887259459435467,0.0,0.0,

Actually, my feeling was that if they spent heavily on the fireworks, they failed to get their money's worth. (To be fair, on a 32"" inch screen with none of the gadgets to expand the visual that are available today, the razzle-dazzle always loses a lot of its pizzazz.)At any rate,  I agree with many, that the kid  was a drag, no fault of his, and that there was no dialogue or action worthy of the cast. The ending of the film was a throwaway offering no meaningful justification for the whole shebang the audience had been through.On the other hand, it is not  a complete wash, some of the scenes are entertaining, some of the actors,  on occasion, do get to emote, and, most of all, I think, it does stir some or many in the audience to think: well, if I were to be given the assignment to provide a strong message and, perhaps, even write some of the words, what would I say that might, if listened to, make a difference.....if anyone were to take the words seriously.",0.75,225,0.0,0.0,0.04433496668117001,0.0,0.0,0.10585853083743708,0.0854537505168298,0.0,0.04766975368796636,0.1357325398612427,0.0,0.24584070708159506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062035566498294906,0.0,0.0,0.058613096900466094,0.1483445870959591,0.0,0.03607825792919359,0.0,0.1182252997239391,0.0,0.0,0.05915309690278489,0.0,0.1271537849465699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05121260030629533,0.0,0.19772264731576414,0.09725389571025571,0.0,0.029817440120303795,0.058003006721108696,0.0668285805431292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13064818459108501,0.0,0.05244560268255847,0.06276818885097622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0514605717365626,0.17806928669792513,0.04180564989844739,0.3178324067764992,0.15959646653145249,0.0,0.0,0.10607892658132219,0.06074652611773431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21383986824565718,0.0,0.059207139531012615,0.17808984027058553,0.5020031855560844,0.06021690310063487,0.0,0.0,0.05076185846796989,0.1002315368282687,0.0,0.0,0.37543708087655103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15468211390831266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05512340311721426,0.12277110055793804,0.15669366631708406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397989261873868,0.05679769018836791,0.0,

I had many people advising me that this movie was terrifying ... well, not really.  I did not find this movie that scary, but more of a definite mind game.  I enjoy the psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the absolute end.  Just when you think you have it all figured out ... you find you were completely wrong!!The plot revolves around two men who end up being trapped together by an unconventional serial killer.  Without giving too much away, he is unconventional in that he does not do the killing with his own hands.  To him, death is a choice his victims make on their own.  The puzzle slowly pieces itself together and all of a sudden, you know who is behind the killing ... well, you think you do.The ending is definitely not what you expect and it leaves you wanting more.  You will be kept guessing until the absolute very last moment.I have not come away so energized after a movie in such a long time as I did with this.  If you enjoy a psychological thrill ride, you will enjoy this.Just an aside ... I loved Cary Elwes in this movie.

778214,B0000DD555,A1622K3BLYEKB5,25,25,1095292800,THE STONES ROCK PARIS,"The Paris Olympia Theatre concert is a confirmation ""The World's Greatest Rock And Roll Band"" never needed gimmicks, large staging, ramps, cages, fire or anything. On this night they nail it doing what they do best - rock.  The band members play a tight set pulling out obscurities ( ""No Expectations"", ""Dance Pt. 1"", ""Everybody Needs Somebody To Love"", ""That's How Strong My Love Is"", ""Love Train"" )  instead of the predictability of the large stage shows.  The camera work captures just the right angles maximizing the modern features of DVD technology.  For long time fans waiting for a Rolling Stones concert like days back in the ""Gimme Shelter"" movie, this is it.  The concert closes with awesome versions of ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"".  The sound quality?  Finally the Stones get it right.  ( THE REST ) The stadium and arena shows are just what fans expect in spite of the gimmicks - a lot of energy.  ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"" from New York's Madison Square Garden is the highlight showcasing the group's instrumental musicianship.  I also like hearing the guys get back to some real Blues at London's Twickenham Staduim  on a slow version of ""I Just Want To Make Love To You"".  The documentary DVD gives an interesting behind the scenes look at what's involved before a superstar band hits the road on a long tour. The Stones take a hands on approach on everything including the t-shirts.  The ""Four Flicks"" set is something special.  The Paris concert alone is worth the price.  Highly Recommended.",1.0,263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805863618563288,0.05378883690710872,0.08882329358272867,0.04780142900690567,0.0,0.1066627190923926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07029399739526654,0.0,0.0,0.05923545349239255,0.0694033605297967,0.0,0.13746911476017376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072634727743293,0.05408604239789268,0.132266594207846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107935668712671,0.0,0.07253631605123004,0.0,0.20015265405550367,0.09733779703747787,0.0,0.1711405034214348,0.1085283624150115,0.26953812722181686,0.0,0.06660485447506914,0.0,0.0,0.04318743049883608,0.0,0.0,0.05757240265389189,0.06640602910869156,0.0,0.22627849345860285,0.22318912623834256,0.0,0.0,0.059338814826005455,0.0,0.057858338604626476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980926067591198,0.0,0.0,0.03984821639803379,0.7301121445836538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11213576146095369,0.0626696488664327,0.06060129620202423,0.12923898859037655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1753037431590015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04250565724950306,0.0,0.09327671744565391,

Even if the english version was unnavailable and the trailer, hard to find (Something Weird has a copy), they could at least get the story straight.",0.3333333333333333,78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20971409117762432,0.0,0.0,0.1259167178717681,0.0,0.16977884035141766,0.0,0.0,0.19637784914366846,0.0,0.13985643622955055,0.0,0.0,0.16228406594758443,0.15482288484888224,0.13061436288954514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15614242322383118,0.0,0.26413659708952725,0.0,0.27067519483074826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305680482528013,0.0856300582002654,0.0,0.07876093129959706,0.1532113692221532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196663929067953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16045820670534824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18675184669434758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14757465749944712,0.0,0.09408266851959987,0.5304041963392906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13237771509447527,0.07398233012044217,0.0,0.22885244351783662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30643745651005605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011436999309272,
1005726,B000GNOKQG,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,11,12,1180396800,Compelling Chase and Revenge Action,"Mel Gibson is obviously a controversial filmmaker. It is nearly impossible to avoid addressing that here but I'm going to try really hard. Suffice to say, Apocalypto is a very violent and brutal film that portrays the Mayan civilization in a way that troubles some Anthropologists. None of that really matters to most viewers though and I'm here to tell you that most viewers will find that this movie is about as intense and compelling as you can get.Apocalypto is two kinds of action sub-genres mended together in an amazing setting that most viewers will find authentic. It is an action chase film smattered with revenge elements typical of a Gibson movie. Apocalypto opens like Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, with no credits and instead a quotation alluding to the theme of a civilization in decline. The quote is from historian Will Durant and states: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" The civilization in this movie is the ancient Mayan civilization and there is a genuine attempt at convincing the audience we are watching from a time machine. Again, like The Passion of the Christ, Gibson refuses to use English and instead goes with Yucatec Mayan, which may or may not be exactly what these people spoke but I have to applaud Gibson for doing this. I can tell you one thing, it hooked me in a lot more than English would have and helped me delve a little deeper and go back in time a little more efficiently than most historical depictions by a long shot. I didn't need my imagination at all. I can't say enough about Gibson's ability to get his audience into the hearts and minds of his characters and their settings. We also get a relatively unknown but talented cast of Native Americans, which itself serves to accentuate the film's authenticity as we have no prior references to the actors' faces.Apocalypto, in perspective, runs as a political parallel and comments on a civilization in decline. However, like most action films, it focuses on one protagonist as we root for his survival and safe resolution to his goals. His name is Jaguar Paw and he is a Mayan man with a young son and a pregnant wife. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that he ends up having an improbably horrendous few days. He and his friends get a good look at how the Mayan civilization is in decline from greed, disease, self-destruction, failed crops, slavery and of course human sacrifice...you will not forget the human sacrifice. This is hell on Earth but Jaguar Paw is up to the task and I couldn't help but root for him out loud on various occasions as I watched. That alone praises the film's passion. I bought into this movie entirely while watching it and it even prompted me to learn more and study the points of contention many people have with Gibson's depiction. A lot of movies that reference history can get folks thinking and whatever you may find in terms of truth, perhaps it is that provocation alone makes Apocalypto effective.",0.9166666666666666,524,0.06549465299555736,0.0,0.027780778314038176,0.038119001618672224,0.0903798640132642,0.34824363565478095,0.02677313052114517,0.15130114178654375,0.08961117771986439,0.0283505013623784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11646355515303909,0.031220301092786593,0.13270888011334886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03672761193215619,0.12393913568153411,0.0,0.06782110107550667,0.15146541668051158,0.18520318659314683,0.030340256726019872,0.0313296914873192,0.0,0.032105245697714,0.10623461572426206,0.0991005638134765,0.0,0.04282840854857906,0.19254227565695622,0.039810878743155476,0.0,0.20313453985675442,0.07785024965088133,0.2989429809951199,0.14538129083120924,0.0,0.03195139511341546,0.09117857162063553,0.0,0.04093279554440265,0.11191425649295705,0.09858897642675522,0.19665619150936,0.09675549351892251,0.03971873896421725,0.0,0.0322457609048862,0.07438678389556595,0.07858764169972825,0.21726249368414974,0.10000490331477313,0.05339984661127779,0.0,0.033235111738546506,0.0,0.032405910939911284,0.08420650023821155,0.0,0.07208557288476643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033498604031650524,0.0,0.07419969117143727,0.24550472086426497,0.2831046514605357,0.03773257455739015,0.0,0.0,0.03180793947695006,0.0,0.08775170134416622,0.06788443135174808,0.27144577959042854,0.0,0.04136185444706887,0.06850102982393588,0.033100398649207045,0.0,0.0,0.04070663459745952,0.1584277381935624,0.0,0.0,0.03272865891215105,0.0,0.07463531629692395,0.0,0.13985751924010634,0.11903509299519084,0.03559005809612192,0.1306085290042111,

It's easy how kids would enjoy watching this animated gem from another time, and much of the symbolism is far enough over their heads to make it suitable for them to watch. Those of us who grew up listening to psychedelic Sixties music will enjoy it also, as an immersion into ""British invasion"" pop art.I thoroughly recommend Yellow Submarine.",1.0,167,0.0,0.0,0.07930935366489951,0.10882320669901724,0.17201266569246018,0.18936682012211242,0.0,0.21596939488532024,0.08527484370397184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649669192339687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08845623972062815,0.0,0.19361760244212514,0.08648155327920275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11365322548777776,0.0,0.1739742733008494,0.11112455008761392,0.053339431173803464,0.3112789735528828,0.0,0.09121574876310452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10649866426839293,0.0,0.0,0.13811016321735825,0.0,0.2115375308140068,0.18411222514288664,0.0,0.0,0.4651853456443773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925133134325449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09563276465454859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3592067495662138,0.10772002376719056,0.11346307770411049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002064180913798,0.09689919975524597,0.20664829560471593,0.0,0.0,0.0977793411563828,0.0,0.06917642774951609,0.1097972526130438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981057800268872,0.0,0.0,0.10653550863787806,0.09043373048255568,0.09981730290925714,0.06796495175312833,0.10160350702173543,0.0,

But they do not pay proper attention to the warning label and do not follow instructions closely.Bibleman is a Christian super hero. He combats various villains with his friends Cypher and BibleGirl. This particular episode is a live action show and as such, has limited production resources. The show also was made in a short-budget, but what really matters after all is the message that is transmitted to the target audience, the little kids. The theological content is excellent and the movie teaches the kids to trust in God. If you want to expose your children to this type of message, this is the correct choice. Just do not expect high quality or Broadway type production or you will be disappointed.",0.0,186,0.0,0.09618101403564898,0.06480579381587073,0.08892235240645534,0.0,0.2707892125365543,0.0,0.05882478937945991,0.0,0.0661348190139959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086724505266612,0.0728293632603569,0.0,0.2720379262254004,0.0,0.08980548063265567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05273670692952511,0.07066638992379884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07489372362337858,0.0,0.07705916458896075,0.0,0.0,0.1497180877609171,0.0,0.07225432922291859,0.14215903123405033,0.0,0.30509552952070457,0.0,0.0,0.07453482765826935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870229066221436,0.0,0.0,0.11285350778620185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833258394310196,0.12670512872655992,0.05832177442557783,0.0,0.0,0.15505885216234552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407904776210791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20180459512621982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412777392864248,0.513655522071536,0.0,0.09271371508681202,0.0,0.0,0.1465115414713833,0.1637626880000908,0.0,0.3377156972920161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05652590906988699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972915990353574,0.0763479949105326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156338757879132,0.05553597963525174,0.0,0.12187116293950562,

This has got to be the weakest of the nature-against-man films which came out during the 70s. The frogs did nothing but ribbit and jump around the estate where most of the movie took place. I wasn't scared at all and I don't think the actors were, too. On the other hand, they may have been a little concerned about getting paid for their roles in this flick, because anyone can see it would've been an instant flop in the theaters.Ray Milland does a great job playing a grouchy old millionaire. Sam Elliott also did a fine job but it seemed these two had to carry the other actors performances just to make the movie bearable to watch.In the end, I recommend you avoid this one like the plague.

Sid once benched with Arnold on Gordon Street, but that was a long time ago when Sid was a young man","True Lies has long been on the Sid the Elf back-burner. It was on the list of films that must be reviewed at some point, and kind of became an emergency B. It was like the Vinny Testaverde of B, weren't too excited to use it because of the apparent clumsiness involved, but if first and second options failed, you might be ok going with it. Well, we officially went into emergency B mode this week so we went with True Lies. It turns out that we were exactly right, there was a ton of clumsiness to endure, but in the end Sid came out ok. Really, you're never in bad hands with Arnold. If Amazon had his California tourism commercials on DVD, we'd not only review them, we'd give them 5 stars. The point is, we could get a laugh or a hundred out of Arnold saying anything at all. True lies was no exception.In this film, Arnold plays  super terrific secret agent Harry Tasker. Tasker's family believes he is a computer salesman, that he loves the computer business, and that he is an incredibly boring person. His mission is to track down nuclear warheads stolen by an arms smuggler from Kazakhstan. We were blown away when we learned that Borat's country was prominently involved in this film. So Arnold goes to a party at the arms dealer's house where he meets Cassandra fromWayne's World 2. She is an antique dealer who is using her business as a front to smuggle the warheads for Aziz the leader of a terrorist organization into U.S. and A, greatest country in the world. Once Arnold starts poking around the situation, Aziz decides to follow him. Arnold, of course, is much too smart for this. He leads Aziz into a mall where he procedes to catch him with the front and make Aziz blead inside his chest. Aziz manages to get away on a motorcycle, being chased by Arnold on a horse. A terribly B action sequence ensues and Aziz gets away. Just great B all-around, trust us.Arnold then finds out that his wife, Laurie Strode, is having a kind of affair with a guy named Simon, who is a B version of Lester Diamond. This is the intentional comedy part of the film with Arnold using secret agent methods to track Simon and his wife. Simon pretends to be a spy to get chicks. Harry and his sidekick, Tom Arnold, kidnap Laurie and interigate her through a one-way mirror. They find out that Mrs. Tasker hasn't done anything with Simon Diamond, but that she is bored with Harry and craves adventure. So Harry gives her a fake assignment, which entails her going to a hotel room and getting ready to have a sexy time with a supposed stranger, even though it was really Arnold doing soundboard in the shadows. Anyway, the terrorists bust into the hotel room and take Harry and Helen prisioner. Some of the most ridiculous action sequences ever filmed ensue, including the famous Arnold iso-rowing Jamie Lee Curtis from the limo to the helicopter scene. So he just saved his wife from the terrorists, now they have kidnapped his daughter. Harry's daughter is played by a young Eliza Dushku. In case you were wondering, the ruling on the field is that it is ok to think she's hot here--moving on. She manages to get the arming key for the missles and has Aziz chase her onto the top of a skyscraper. Arnold flies to her in a marine jet and has her jump in. Ok. Aziz manages to jump onto the plane as well, but he is hanging from a missle. So Arnold fires the missle into a helicopter carrying the other terrorists and kills them all. That encapsulates why Sid believes Arnold should be the sole exception to the law stating the president must be born in the U.S. At the end of the film, we see that Arnold and Jamie Lee are now secret agent partners as they go off to a mission together.This film was an action-comedy(both intentional and unintentional), by James Cameron. We liked it, but we also lost interest in the second half of the film. Maybe we just couldn't resist the lure of the Arnold soundboard after listening to him for a solid 45 minutes. Maybe it was only enjoyable after doing a unit in the bushes and making countless ""Good. Now we are having fun"" jokes and assesing the parallels of the film with Wayne's World 2 because of Charlton Heston and Tia Carrere. If you're an Arnold fan, it's certainly a must. You can always laugh at Arnold and as a bonus, you can make fun of Tom Arnold and his ""I can't believe they gave me this part!"" glow throughout the film. This film isn't the Governator's best work, but it did just fine in a B pinch. Without hesitation, Sid recomends.",1.0,822,0.0,0.05301835288368109,0.053584844366946716,0.024508561832094468,0.1162192288089906,0.24522686129155336,0.0344274979381833,0.06485257975076987,0.09602564760940184,0.09113958735875885,0.051790178049974295,0.02476099757173984,0.02531353665224723,0.08985610707880527,0.08029220569873038,0.06399374962248777,0.0,0.0,0.02475196747928838,0.023613969667649826,0.17929463372286816,0.023951925353208132,0.058140650022186394,0.07790759196211237,0.09526091570867694,0.019507228059379045,0.020143383834619753,0.023831524179347797,0.06192607617495228,0.03415170305656032,0.1699108715815741,0.17952211762246695,0.08260940642544684,0.1856922034096178,0.0,0.05974368583847278,0.16978660994722974,0.12513428842519853,0.18019218326669403,0.12852497523187892,0.0,0.08217242944529149,0.019541047469195126,0.0,0.0,0.023985041218978792,0.0,0.025287967809264175,0.0,0.0,0.023820657426971842,0.0,0.02391344231458167,0.016842606871886247,0.22117367027972754,0.11252153628293819,0.01716668048640316,0.04746837751854629,0.02136847127291337,0.024473482907671935,0.10417668856352211,0.0,0.0,0.04634732404383966,0.02290955327885896,0.0,0.10906621224997293,0.0,0.09615644030754604,0.04307576659071762,0.0,0.0,0.15784693658990212,0.475279046247139,0.0,0.0766605838935284,0.026218130818237075,0.02045087274899891,0.0807623072510213,0.09027174509046956,0.021823102817125177,0.24433598853365693,0.05188597941883301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12463626524159328,0.0,0.026172277044098073,0.33104794251707115,0.0444160925807413,0.07419279643836943,0.0,0.021727748599597918,0.023993339104467395,0.04073397104293744,0.0,0.15306691219492485,0.0,0.10076949782432768,
979454,B000EWBKLM,A2582KMXLK2P06,0,1,1367193600,where will destiny take these soldiers?,"Straight Into Darkness is one of the more fascinating war movies because the storyline is different from the norm.  It's about two American soldiers that end up walking through the cold forests and hills of snowy Germany alone during World War II after an explosion kills the rest of the group.  One of the soldiers has a loose trigger and basically forces the other one to tag along and do whatever he says, whenever he wants.  They eventually find a building where children are staying.Now the unique thing here is, these children aren't defenseless- they are specially trained to fight in a war.  It was never really said if they were trained by the older man and woman who also live in the building- all we see are the children acting oddly quiet for an extended period of time not because they're weird, but because they're preparing for a potential German invasion (which does happen, soon in fact).  Apparently the old man and woman are actually French even though they look and sound distinctly British.Having a storyline focus around the children during World War II is a fascinating and welcoming alternative- we're so used to seeing American men battling either the Germans or Japanese that having a storyline focus on the children is a nice change.  I can't really find any sources that say whether this story is fictional but... I think it absolutely has to be.  I'd like to think that, even though I wasn't always the most alert student in history class, that several children being trained to take out a German army would have been mentioned in several history book chapters over the years.  I would have remembered it.The presentation of the movie is really beautiful.  Well I mean, beautiful in a really grim and dreary kind of way, capturing the accuracy of a snowy German forest during such a devastating war.  It's amazingly effective in appearance, and reminds me of Saving Private Ryan (hey whether you like that Tom Hanks movie or not, you gotta admit it *looks* amazing).  My only complaint is that the action is too camera jerky.  By that I mean, you see a shooting/death for a split second, then it immediately switches to another shooting so you can't really absorb the powerful impact of the first death.  A war-hectic segment near the end is a perfect example.  It all becomes a blur.Still, Straight Into Darkness succeeds in telling World War II from a different angle, whether fictional or otherwise.  Highly recommended.",0.0,419,0.043147144331100874,0.054324549476718366,0.07320666324485635,0.05022474322323331,0.0793883237556324,0.19664486518359686,0.14110270978849052,0.0,0.0,0.0373539859574365,0.15919834945022573,0.05074205306339917,0.0,0.06137990927402475,0.08227033968115009,0.08742712484724262,0.05121709979510826,0.0,0.0,0.09678295863822037,0.0,0.049084042907470975,0.08935956457384585,0.07982697696103737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460230608435688,0.06998617578636071,0.08704845631583771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04081038157200848,0.21411641797203013,0.10257374623014376,0.24617536237349258,0.19155113437921212,0.0,0.0,0.08008989659834852,0.0,0.0,0.04915190636948646,0.04329954279503556,0.05182195914060061,0.06374143617450764,0.052332521338945,0.0,0.04248629273365783,0.0,0.0690302116579201,0.23855016513996383,0.03294105548916333,0.10553766377623557,0.048637841102746326,0.13136951773518998,0.0501528569173889,0.04269730283478248,0.0,0.0,0.2374458429194278,0.09389587513722694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882033318466561,0.0,0.04612597157958733,0.0,0.23525201780844018,0.5180727102088064,0.0,0.0,0.05372811742934347,0.0,0.24825606893546817,0.02312393546662948,0.044721503564073624,0.1669037452893671,0.05316427808065624,0.05449745351733442,0.04512771173614574,0.0,0.031926722490630055,0.0,0.05363415051085495,0.10437042068687928,0.04551035797469414,0.05068044078717338,0.0,0.0,0.04916891100528745,0.04173752115913768,0.0,0.0,0.09378532769872382,0.137669499272247,

927903,B000AM4P6S,AHRQOLXJE4CBV,1,1,1136073600,THE CARTOON THAT INSPIRED KING KONG ESCAPES.,"These are the first 4 half hours of the 60s cartoon KING KONG. 2 Kongs per show with a Tom from T.H.U.M.B (Tiny Human Underground Military Bureau)sandwiched in between. The Tom episodes did very little for me. However [I was a 9 1/2 oz Weakling Till One Day...] was a bit charming and a little moving. Plus the first half of the KING KONG pilot episode. If memory serves correctly. This show vanished from television slightly before GIGANTOR.These were my two favorite cartoons when I was 5-7 years old. I was devastated when these great,exciting, adventurous cartoons were removed from my life. Thank God for DVDs and Film Vaults. Both shows had boys voiced by females named Billie. Billie Lou Watt for Jimmy Sparks (GIGANTOR) and Billie Mae Richards for Bobby Bond (KING KONG) Both boys wore shorts. Both boys were in charge of controlling their giant entities as a power of ultimate good. Both shows were animated in Japan.But not at the same studio. Both shows were made in the 60s,the opus era of television entertainment. Here are a few differences King Kong was shot in color. Gigantor although made in color was shot in Black and White. King Kong would only listen to Bobby. Gigantor would respond to who ever had his control box.(Which seldom happened) The live action movie King Kong Escapes was based on this cartoon. Gigantor was based on a live action movie made in the 50s. I don't remember the title but I've seen pictures on the internet many years ago plus a copy of the vhs at a comic book store,that I regret not buying",1.0,272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13253011959365085,0.10698425234252618,0.05038272581976581,0.11936077531564988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307664909308862,0.06237747520190741,0.0,0.0,0.08013228062448964,0.0,0.0,0.06190691706931497,0.14886233270149682,0.18067342519345217,0.18157474352708544,0.0,0.060619165904972,0.06259603480522466,0.1481140337928896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06411587228352927,0.0,0.061884965453025874,0.3246866757602973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817828255860625,0.07453407467555642,0.0,0.0,0.09665767443574343,0.0,0.0,0.12885264272328928,0.0,0.10467758690586548,0.21704284292150616,0.14985569865374482,0.05334585976414959,0.0737545448096893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17284321274532938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04459209407642353,0.4085155168854695,0.0753888544111939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0701303880222425,0.0,0.07231235998116418,0.0,0.08264007584068621,0.0,0.06613386878550037,0.38731009949020606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3842597405912949,0.0,0.13503897048738103,0.07455986054813467,0.06329088225922837,0.0,0.04756589976116419,0.14221630725004258,0.0,

Freddie Prinze and Jack Albertson are magnetic to watch. Comedies like this are not being made any more. I hope Warner Home Video will decide to release FULL SEASON sets, as this dvd was great, but only a sampling of how funny the show really was. Freddie's catchphrase of ""looking goood"" wasn't in any of these episodes, unfortunately, and it would have been nice to have a tribute to Freddie Prinze. During the run of the show, there were other semi-regular cast members, aside from Louie the Garbageman (Scatman Crothers) and Mando (Isaac Ruiz), including Mabel the Mail Carrier (Bonnie Boland), the Rev. Bemis (Ronny Graham) and Della Rogers (Della Reese). Plus there were several guest appearances on various shows such as, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Orlando, Jose Feliciano, Shelly Winters, Rich Little, Avery Schreiber, Jim Backus and Ceasar Romero.

1371611,B003Y5H4Y8,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,1,1,1340409600,"If there is no such thing as absolute morality, then child abuse is not evil, it just may not be your thing---R.M. Pippert","THE DEBT is more of a psychological thriller than an action thriller. The action simply provides the bedrock for the psychodrama. THE DEBT is a remake of a 2007 Israeli film which was rather different.The acting in THE DEBT is excellent, particularly that of Jessica Chastain as the younger Rachel. Chastain is a talented actress who, though she has appeared in many films, has fortunately managed to avoid celebrity. Helen Mirren, who plays the older Rachel turns in her usual work of stellar caliber.It is 1965. Stefan, David and Rachel are Mossad agents tasked to capture the Mengele-esque ""Surgeon of Birkenau,"" a Dr. Vogel, who is living inconspicuously in East Berlin, practicing gynecology twenty years after escaping justice for his war crimes of useless and horrifying medical experiments on Auschwitz inmates.They capture Dr. Vogel but when they attempt to sneak him ""over the wall"" into West Berlin things go badly awry, and so the three agents are forced to care for him while awaiting extraction. Realizing that his captors have become as much a set of prisoners as he himself, the wily Vogel (who is an unrepentant Nazi to the core) begins to torment them psychologically; eventually, he makes his escape.Recriminations fly back and forth. Finally, Stefan convinces David and Rachel to agree to the story that they killed Dr. Vogel while he was trying to escape. Eventually, they are extracted, and return to Israel as heroes, where they are feted and invited to speak publicly about their successful mission.Thirty-odd years pass. Stefan is now head of the Mossad. Stefan and Rachel have been married and divorced, and have a daughter who is a notable Israeli journalist. Their daughter writes their memoirs which become an international best-seller.At the same time that their daughter's book comes to print, a Ukrainian journalist announces that he has gotten an exclusive interview with a old man claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau. Rachel, Stefan and David's thirty-five year old lie begins to unravel. How they deal with that unraveling and the consequences they face make up the kernel of THE DEBT.I didn't like THE DEBT. I can't appreciate films where the motives and motivations of the characters get twisted into Turkish Taffy by dint of their own stupidity. There's something pathetic about watching intelligent people knowingly sticking their feet into bear traps, and that's what we have here. THE DEBT's biggest failing is the moral relativism of its characters. Dr. Vogel is the only character who seems to have the courage of his convictions, however twisted they may be. What I kept asking myself as THE DEBT played out was why the three agents simply didn't kill Vogel after their first botched extraction attempt. In the end, their lie, made true, would have been a better resolution than the self-imposed unresolvable ethical morass in which they lived their lives.",1.0,476,0.06613050362979045,0.08326182119467265,0.0,0.0,0.12167641482823663,0.23441635775755168,0.10813222296052427,0.12730836600744053,0.03016038736208112,0.05725148076983683,0.0,0.07777102230780523,0.039753237283101844,0.02351884682039244,0.03152340138178489,0.03349931893919853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03128559770603238,0.03761491667616095,0.06847953788157957,0.0,0.03740024396824466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725081224380287,0.1608989815070686,0.13341690036744283,0.040275375398952755,0.08648841080727841,0.129607706653388,0.040197380103807454,0.0,0.12306399509814146,0.11790908070312824,0.20751860919330564,0.01834908947007676,0.04228207028784421,0.0,0.03068792431002753,0.0,0.04133018896229903,0.0,0.033182040391852595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0374087690686172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25593373476661535,0.025243948624718446,0.0,0.03727297573749154,0.0,0.0,0.03272052164600116,0.042512006820104316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0428203205532465,0.0,0.030201467620724173,0.0,0.035348037260171605,0.07492005410998827,0.1577470285279676,0.5081833863032441,0.3428900895174266,0.04013012778691837,0.0,0.032116744815478056,0.2853717051678796,0.0,0.03427174149787122,0.27408109351634824,0.0,0.0,0.03458303383730772,0.0,0.07339988324668996,0.0,0.0,0.039991455929919734,0.0,0.0,0.06609280599242176,0.034121993997655,0.11303986271106173,0.19191003279375457,0.0,0.048076295021670705,0.03593558189047421,0.0,

Here, an accident happens in space which pushes Earth closer and closer to World War III, and now, James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate, when all of a sudden, he stumbles upon a Japanese space base, which plans to launch a satellite and instigate global warfare. Truly this is a great film and my favorite Connery 007 portrayal, it was also his last before the decent-at-best ""Diamonds are Forever"".And aside from that, this is the DVD to get! I picked it up for cheap at HMV (about $10) and who ever knew an amazing transfer would come for a cheap price. It's been restored frame-by-frame, so the picture looks beautiful. Watching it on an HDTV is like watching it at the theater for the first time, and I'm sure it looks just as great as it did back in 1967 (I wasn't alive back then but OK :P). The sound is amazing, in fact it is the best Bond movie for Surround Sound! Great use of the back speakers, and it sounds like a movie that just got released today. It really is that amazing.There are no special features, aside from commentary. But other than that, this doesn't need special features, having the film on DVD with this amazing picture and sound quality is the equivalent of getting an awesome love-it-forever birthday present. So if you want this film, be sure to buy this DVD!!! It's money well spent.",1.0,251,0.059161953312021585,0.0,0.05018929132117808,0.06886652546178804,0.21770934676503736,0.2696330084736318,0.09673771066569929,0.09111452286075164,0.16189328655142285,0.05121856399749788,0.0,0.0695758437975946,0.21338526450463444,0.08416212435520228,0.0564031996860564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20865141051355907,0.0,0.16793312942402966,0.0673024344919137,0.1633692169515454,0.10945614031296468,0.06691833166414125,0.0,0.1698024794645646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05967899832398645,0.0,0.0,0.05797509975753248,0.0,0.05595786063340034,0.11009603636387985,0.0,0.30379284582992166,0.393972977054212,0.0,0.11544801656294378,0.1098166471216668,0.0681844191331385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740017281466303,0.0,0.0,0.058255815212728684,0.0671943011311081,0.0,0.13083687415588915,0.09033539610146753,0.0,0.06669061716893432,0.0,0.06876795731003493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651155949748778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807586328599547,0.0,0.0,0.06702529846442215,0.16128493681225625,0.28414574330485126,0.0,0.0,0.07367023760611714,0.057464838554517596,0.0,0.19024070468749302,0.061320663207692395,0.19615967782852223,0.0,0.0,0.06187764256944751,0.0,0.04377687781378907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240231457847553,0.0,0.0,0.061052727712569595,0.13483760570457853,0.05722912411602037,0.0,0.04301022017630249,0.06429768718975354,0.09438395767206337,
101895,0790733889,A34D06JL7LC6MU,8,8,1145836800,One of the Best Political Movies Ever,"Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman deliver Oscar worthy performances,while Jason Robards won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this moviewhich is (in my opinion) one of the best ""political"" films ever made. I'm not even sure if it was nominated for Best Picture, but I have to say...This moviewas better than ""Rocky"" OK. The movie won four Academy Awards;The one I mentioned above, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound. It's also rated PG, which is strange because they use the word f**k at least 8 times  in this movie and nowadays, two uses can get you slapped with an R rating. But the movie opens as we witness four men breaking into the Watergate Building, which we all know was the setting for Democratic National Headquarters. The police show up and catch the men in the act of setting up survelliance/bugging the place and the story shows upBob Woodward's (Redford) desk. Woodward is a reporter at The Washington Post who reports the story and then begins to see oddities about it. Why would men break into the Democratic National Headquarters? Who sent them? Etc. Eventually joining in the act of helping him is Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) who begin a thorough investigation of the scandal that begins to turrn up names very high up in government and eventually even The President of the United States, Richard Nixon. Bernstein and Woodward worked their a$$es off to get this story, through apparent death threats and when people wouldn't talk to them, and they got it all right. Robards plays their boss, Ben Bradlee and deserved his Oscar. Another performance that was really good, although his face is almost entirely hidden in shadow is Hal Holbrook as the mysterious Deep Throat. Deep Throat was one of Woodward's informants who apparently worked high up in the government and seemed to know everything about the Watergate cover-up. Except he refused to just give up and information, only hints and could never be directly quoted or even referred to. Woodward, to this day has not given up the identity of Deep Throat or even gave the vaguest idea of who he might've been. Anyway, for a movie about reporters trying to unravel a cover-up, this movie was incredibly entertaining and exciting. It's never boring, it's never dull; both Hoffman & Redford play their parts extraordinarily well, which causes us to like the movie even more. And it's strange too, the movie doesn't end with Nixon resigning; but instead ends with Nixon taking his 2nd Oath of Office. We're given the remainder of the details as they're typed up on a Typewriter. I though the ending was abrupt, but perfect.GRADE: A",1.0,447,0.10420552464479982,0.0,0.058934288461718005,0.04043292473437138,0.06391077212545178,0.28143461739227577,0.0,0.08024275844469067,0.06336720708394847,0.030071450958601136,0.04272034371947786,0.040849379821833134,0.25056557685423275,0.09882655809103877,0.0,0.03519116407404385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19478537027038192,0.0,0.0,0.09591735910330217,0.0,0.0785782018007352,0.03218198967791846,0.0,0.0,0.034054118097319334,0.028170833700822226,0.07007748485279162,0.0,0.045428204984501994,0.10211504773525952,0.0,0.03285398750866463,0.17237227025287247,0.08257596345713918,0.1189086007356584,0.13493052605814004,0.0,0.03389092838008826,0.0322377831455655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03485786173326819,0.0,0.17960040889553824,0.0,0.0,0.0342031629451478,0.0,0.05557207808822178,0.19204241283237142,0.02651886563848018,0.08496203548795797,0.03915540513186631,0.07050513992500947,0.0,0.0,0.04465902754138066,0.0,0.03823067786560417,0.03779496527654944,0.0,0.0,0.04588019651398916,0.0,0.0,0.11139974945543253,0.039351903264155115,0.04734681811801461,0.48380030485398073,0.12006912161878551,0.08431370881449794,0.043253280927381524,0.0,0.09992802656555325,0.11169415100390435,0.0,0.2111437155670071,0.042799367726742164,0.04387262721259626,0.3632961076479793,0.03510967943623951,0.15421372231705,0.0,0.0,0.12603353725585054,0.03663765627325084,0.0,0.0,0.0358452866305868,0.118748812857732,0.16800185957406738,0.0,0.07575650071799171,0.03775046772440958,0.02770736167605942,

Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD.

Content doesn't hold up as well as I'd hoped.,"Notice that there are quite a few 5-star reviews of this product that were written well before the product hit the shelves.  Most of those glowing reviews are from folks who are gushing about how elated they are to finally get their hands on a show they haven't watched in 30 years.  They are just waxing nostalgic for the good old days.Well, I saw a few episodes of this show in its first season on TV too.  I liked them a lot, especially the ""Scavenger Hunt"" episode.  But I was twelve years old at the time.  When you are 12 and grew up with only 3 or 4 channels of TV programming, almost every show was good.  You carry those fond memories of watching the show with you through the rest of your years --- until you are in your early forties and watch the show again...""The Paper Chase - Season 1"" doesn't hold up as well as I hoped it would. It was interesting to revisit the show, but I'm watching the episodes with a far more ""dramatically sophisticated"" eye.  The storylines are fine, but the dialogue and directing styles are dated, thin, and weak compared to what I'm used to now.  Again, good stories but too often the dialogue seems weak.  After watching great drama like ""NYPD Blue"", ""The Wire"", etc, it is hard to watch this late-Seventies series and not snicker a bit at how comparatively hokey it is.  It may not have seemed hokey at the time, but the passage of time has not been good to the show.The actors are earnest enough, but they are undermined by the now-dated style of televised drama from that era.I don't remember seeing the show when it was resurrected on Showtime years later.  Maybe those seasons hold up better.  I can't say because I don't know.Don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that all contemporary dramas are better than the stuff from the Seventies.  There is some stuff on TV today that is pure drivel.  But it just turns out that the first season of ""The Paper Chase"" had an excellent concept but was executed in a style that would not stay fresh this long.  Oddly, the movie still holds up well.It is fun to watch the show for the nostalgia, that's for sure.  But it isn't the same degree of compelling it might have once been, mostly due to the quality of many shows/series that followed it.",0.5263157894736842,410,0.03327480779053843,0.041894752715823075,0.028228260366044925,0.0,0.03061188932354894,0.08425071659395544,0.3264525812582105,0.05124608072232245,0.09105459997519276,0.0,0.04092425706382064,0.078263907786123,0.0,0.21301110924732838,0.031723185649847725,0.03371162588012207,0.0,0.12225813275872933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570661366580253,0.06891353718854706,0.09234309788250426,0.0752745472092228,0.12331586347268784,0.0318343380626241,0.037663026406172806,0.03262238460082868,0.05397290095065186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090427401704306,0.0,0.08256262104097525,0.0,0.09492444972586106,0.20311917523956857,0.04255003922819845,0.06493211170142796,0.03088241361726927,0.0,0.041592125212474844,0.03790564271027098,0.033392336532558665,0.03996477070418035,0.024578498413750052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330891684876698,0.20236523455118005,0.10161574368937192,0.0,0.03750919879242309,0.03377045008764968,0.0,0.03292789284267215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003101405856535,0.0,0.39556134467123233,0.0,0.03403818661288691,0.0,0.03769743557560894,0.20410299501393445,0.4794413198176496,0.03834035630128414,0.04038445847002195,0.0,0.06464057897247805,0.12763568489062962,0.07133213749752496,0.10346683134664324,0.14710299915383201,0.08199991734708789,0.0,0.13920883593352396,0.0,0.1231084432964222,0.11723908811562248,0.0,0.0,0.14038921347524624,0.03908443889106696,0.03325583951464833,0.06867649446966559,0.0,0.03218771521856595,0.0,0.07257147859100835,0.0723266580239998,0.10616985661323858,
1544637,B008220DGE,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,3,5,1359072000,The Master,"Two things can be said with certainty about Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, The Master. First, Anderson definitely knows his way around a camera; second, Joaquin Phoenix emphatically knows his way around appearing `disturbed.' Both of these elements are used to their absolute potential in order to challenge and entice the audience to look a little closer at this film than, perhaps, Anderson has asked in the past.The Master is Anderson's sixth stop on his cinematic journey through American culture and it may be his most polarizing one to date. Director, Anderson has mesmerized audiences with triumphantly engaging dissections of American culture in films like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and of course 2007&#8242;s There Will Be Blood. The Master returns Anderson to his role as writer along with being director after his singular exception, adapting Upton Sinclair's Oil! into There Will Be Blood. This time Anderson takes an isolated and cold look at specific segment of post-World War II 1950s America. Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a Naval veteran who struggles with alcoholism, anger issues, and repressed memories of a troubled upbringing which partially manifest in unhealthy sexual obsessions. After the war, Quell finds himself in a series of odd-jobs that he is in no way suited for, including one that results in his being chased off after one of his ""home-made"" alcoholic concoctions seemingly brings about the death, or near death, of one of his co-workers. It is here that Quell finds himself a stow-away on a yacht commanded by a charming, yet nefarious character by the name of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (who stars in four of Anderson's six films). Dodd is at sea to officiate and celebrate the wedding of his daughter, but upon the discovery of Quell his interests turn to him and his story. Dodd's compassion for Quell unveils to reveal his role as leader of a cultest group known as The Cause. Dodd uses his wit, intellect, and charm to pray on the affluent, which in turn results in additional wealth, appreciation, and power for him and his group. He is quick to accept compliments, but resorts to shouting down and conceivably condoning violence against his critics. Quell, who has been wrestling with his uncertain future, is easily drawn in by their hypnotizing appeal.What follows is a slow-burn of a drama that gains all of its leisurely paced momentum from the conflicts that arise between Quell and Dodd. It is also a challenging film for the viewer. It is a cinematic puzzle on par with enigmatic films like Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life in 2011. We are forced to pay close attention as we constantly question a look, a question, or an action in an ongoing battle to understand these characters' true motivations. A follow-up to There Will Be Blood, it is hard to ignore the similarities between Blood's Daniel Plainview and Master's Lancaster Dodd; the names are iconically memorable for starters. Furthermore, Dodd's methodical and meticulous effort to distort and corrupt the psyche of Quell in order to vindicate or authenticate himself certainly rings a bell.The Master is not an easy film to understand, nor is it an easy film to watch given its 140 minute running time. What it is, is a beautifully acted and orchestrated character analysis filmed on 65 mm film stock. Anderson takes endless risks here and while the film drags, his criticisms on some of the supposed motivations of those who promise answers, faith, or comfort do stay with you after the credits role.

581698,B00005BKZQ,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,25,25,1088985600,A great sequel,"La Cage Aux Folles II is a terrific sequel, a rare treat that closely duplicates the charm of the original, while being a completely different film. This time around, the couple unwillingly get involved in a spy ring, with murder, mayhem, and one funne chase after another ensuing.The casting is pricless, with Michel Serrault even funnier as Albin, the main attraction of the elegant cabaret, ""La Cage Aux Folles."" Ugo Tognazzi is also terrific as his partner Renato, and their comic misadventures are a pure joy to watch. This is 100 minutes of pure escapism; hilarious, entertaining, and touching. While the escapades are taken to the extreme, these are real people with real emotions, which makes them all the better to watch. Any gay man can relate to Albin's feelings of being unloved and unaccepted and Renato trying to be the macho man in a homophobic society.The film is entertaining from start to finish, a wonderful way to spend an evening. Make some popcorn and enjoy!",1.0,166,0.0,0.11937034728789474,0.08043053186360588,0.11036161548973539,0.08722218470836113,0.2880657833392883,0.232539610999448,0.14601500322632796,0.0,0.0820799862912309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09605423658294747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633328297683851,0.1794134507121445,0.0,0.0,0.08770412322393574,0.10723954982207394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09290763000625078,0.0,0.0,0.11762247188223363,0.0,0.27046739258133184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20967180644946445,0.0,0.077301255130957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189675760649575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09698470318207376,0.0,0.0,0.06461653924531517,0.5008915632219691,0.10924283711304383,0.11506707929032284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10162301331177728,0.09826904158621978,0.36674686179184135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22269886253626658,0.11785329532674338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804157676418719,0.0,0.0,0.20677727020770387,0.0,0.0,

If you manage to sit thru the entire thing (it took me two sittings because it was that bad), you'll discover they'd hoped to produce Hansel and Gretal as a series. Thankfully, I believe the viewing public's lack of enthusiasm for this rotten tomato squelched that idea. The story was STUPID and even from a fantasy standpoint, barely watchable. I would say if you like lots of gross violence perpetrated on some ugly and bizarre witches, but no good storyline or even likable characters, then this might be a movie for you. It was NOT a movie for me.

1095176,B000UJ48R2,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,35,41,1186099200,An OK collection but nothing to get excited over,"The following is a description of the films in this Signature Collection dedicated to the talents of Burt Lancaster:Flame and the Arrow (1950) - This is an enjoyable swashbuckling type of film set in the 12th century. For some reason, when the local overlord stole Dardo's (Lancaster's) wife he does nothing, but when his son is taken from him he finally decides to take action. This film is important for two reasons - a. because it is fun and full of action b. because it revived Lancaster's career after he had been type-cast for several years as less than bright villains in film noir films. Lancaster purchased and produced this film himself, and as a result of it we got to see him as Elmer Gantry and Sgt. Milton Warden later on.Jim Thorpe - All American (1951) - This is a very good biopic and the best film in the set, in my opinion. Lancaster plays Thorpe, a Native American athlete who loses his Olympic gold medals when it is learned he played two seasons of minor league baseball prior to competing, thus violating his amateur status. This is a turning point in his life, and his marriage ends and he feels his dream of coaching as a career will never be. The film ends before the truly sad years in Thorpe's life begin, when he is truly broke.South Sea Woman (1953) - Lancaster plays Marine Sergeant James O'Hearn who is being court martialed during World War II when he arrives in Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack and has no excuse for his absence up to that point. He refuses to defend himself. A showgirl takes the stand in his defense and tells the court that O'Hearn is really just standing up for a buddy of his, one who is really guilty of the scandalous behavior.His Majesty O'Keefe (1954) - Probably the weakest film in the set, but still above average. After a mutiny, ship captain O'Keefe (Lancaster) winds up on the island of Yap. There is a fortune to be made in cocoanut there, and meanwhile the local islanders have made O'Keefe their king based on a local legend and their mistaken belief in who he represents. O'Keefe has two problems - the islanders don't want to work at harvesting the cocoanut and the Germans already ""own the rights"" to the cocoanut trade there. Nice little action film with a charming performance by Lancaster.Executive Action (1973) - Made about the time of Watergate as people began to be much less trustful of government, this is one of the first films to address the possibility that what the public was told about the Kennedy assassination might have been less than truthful. Much of what was in the film JFK is presented here, both rightly and wrongly, but the larger more complex conspiracy theory that was floated in JFK is not. That is probably because in 1973 people were just beginning to reevaluate this whole issue. At any rate, it is a very good film and worth revisiting.I don't have any information on extra features other than that they will be ""Oscar-nominated vintage shorts, vintage featurettes and classic cartoons."" In other words, I am not expecting biographical material. One real question I have is why is ""The Twilight's Last Gleaming"" not included? Warner Home Video has the rights to it, and it is better than any picture in this set. Considering Burt Lancaster did his best-known work at other studios, you'd think they would bother to include it in a Signature Collection of the actor's better works. Thus I can only give this collection four stars. In fact, it is probably between 3.5 and 4 stars given the information I have and no knowledge if there will even be any commentary included on the films.",0.8536585365853658,635,0.05130935947690299,0.09690181867421724,0.02176382156204148,0.0,0.023601585371377524,0.24683585339166805,0.0,0.09877606183767697,0.07020255731546585,0.111050749887275,0.0946570794742425,0.060341009389800485,0.06168751272628885,0.054743434561390004,0.024458388257368038,0.025991463898491537,0.0,0.06284019752701395,0.0,0.028772886902431887,0.2427388105396882,0.029184675384227237,0.08855321506013095,0.023731993856983814,0.0,0.047537900203318106,0.0,0.029037970302144007,0.07545499596936749,0.1040319674542087,0.23290999587772496,0.0,0.0671046599847401,0.27654020653511024,0.0,0.024265273761795842,0.30236263628949556,0.0,0.3220192296388233,0.1281302845761053,0.0,0.05006227356526341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02574529370249217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05804945900534377,0.025261746756445897,0.05827556999938894,0.06156657641482468,0.21275781455862833,0.09793142071419711,0.06275119724602678,0.028919370122977798,0.0,0.08946053108246332,0.0,0.06596846297219695,0.0,0.05647277148706872,0.027914577462208223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026243240289416877,0.0,0.1162579982719721,0.10490813357866377,0.43125415446976745,0.059120375279658334,0.0,0.0,0.09967500711565627,0.04920317856799303,0.13749163887571308,0.026590771397386078,0.19847719699309918,0.0,0.09721023754106851,0.08049689103657343,0.05186256207010249,0.05694952840750138,0.0,0.0,0.031028585534446464,0.0,0.030133870909767206,0.051280110620157415,0.13237292625923058,0.0,0.0992661512148051,0.08217464405901871,0.018650726731145872,0.027881712493104584,0.02046408266604955,
1523008,B006Z7Z3KY,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,5,7,1352246400,The Absolute MOTHER of all DVD boxed Sets!!!,"'Dark Shadows' is iconic for the multitudes of us who ran home every weekday form school in hopes of not missing a  single minute of it. The simple fact that this series survived being erased by the powers that be at ABC (a common practice designed to save money on 1 inch VTR tape) is miraculous to say the least. Also, the fact that Dark Shadows has been preserved and assembled in this fashion is a testament to series creator Dan Curtis , the excellent writers, actors , directors and production staff and the unwavering loyalty of it's many fans. (I am pushing 60 and very proud to be a Dark Shadows fan!)  The fact that I am writing a product review for an almost 45 year old low budget daytime soap speaks volumes.With that in mind, this review will concentrate mainly on the product itself, the video, audio and packaging, rather than Dark Shadows itself. If you have read this far, it is likely you are considering this purchase as a long time fan of the series and just want to know what you get for your money here.  Read on McDuff and find out more!Cutting to the chase:  Is this giant coffin packed with almost 17 pounds of Dark Shadows worth your hard earned money and is the series still watchable in terms of picture and sound quality?  And is this coffin packaging really any good or a cheap piece of junk?  The answers are YES, the show is probably better looking in this form than it EVER looked on your old 23 inch Magnavox B&W; TV (color for the lucky few back then) and YES the packaging is quite nice even though it is NOT made of wood but a very strong reinforced cardboard material.  (hey, the hinges ARE real and they add a lot to the overall ""WOW"" factor)Now into specifics:  The coffin is VERY large! The lid is attached with two metal hinges and there is a piece of cloth that keeps the lid open although it could be a bit stronger. The coffin is not to scale and is not as long as an actual coffin would be, more like a short and stubby version.  The printing on the outside is fine and while a bit overdone in my opinion, you will never mistake THIS set for anything else.  The red lettering for the series title look very nice. (blood I presume?) It is also HEAVY!  It needs to be. Inside there are 22 Standard DVD cases that hold 6 discs each except for the 22nd which holds 5 discs. With 1,225 episodes you are not going to finish this anytime soon. The spines are cleverly printed so you get an image of Barnabas at rest in his coffin. It is very cool.  The discs are black with red and white printing on them for the disc number and episodes contained.  Upon receiving this set I took a good 35 minutes and carefully inspected each disc case for damage and to make sure I had all the discs.  I was happy to see everything was ship shape.  The disc cases are snug inside the coffin but are easily removed and replaced.Also inside (mine was under the cases) you will find a nicely printed episode guide with nicely printed pictures and other information. Honestly, this booklet is much nicer than some of the ones included in my top tier Blu Ray multi disc sets, printed on heavy glossy stock and really a nice inclusion.Thing to watch out for:  Don't spill water anywhere near the coffin or it will disintegrate as it is NOT made of wood. Also, take care when lifting and give it the support it requires so it doesn't break or slip out of your hands. Some real damage could be done if you dropped it, either on the floor or on something or somebody else. Exercise a bit of care and this set is going to look extremely good for years to come. It is by far the single largest disc set I own. Hands down..........Each disc gives you the option to play ""ALL"" or access separate episodes but once you start an episode it will play on into the next one if not stopped. No problem knowing what episode you are viewing as each starts with the original ""slate"" which in this case was a chalkboard showing the date it was taped, the day it will air and the episode number along with the ABC announcer's voice over. Sometimes you get to see the actors finding their places in the background. I suppose they could have been edited out of this presentation but I rather enjoy having them.  Some discs also include a special feature which can be accessed from the main disc menu.  I found disc navigation to be excellent and am well into the 200's now with no disc glitches of any kind, other than the infrequent video/audio aberrations that are on the original studio tapes.Speaking of special features, they are VAST and PLENTIFUL on this set. Listing and describing them would take another 4 paragraphs so suffice it to say you will enjoy them and find they add much to the value and enjoyment of this huge set.  Everything from cast interviews and reunions, to outtakes and bloopers. Totally cool stuff and well worth watching for any fan.And finally, how is the picture and sound quality? For the most part, it is pretty darn good!  The first 294 are Black & White with the remainder in color.  The picture is not uniform from show to show, nor is it even uniform within the same show at times. BUT it is more than watchable and really crisper than what passed for broadcast quality back in the 60's.  This is old tape folks, and the fact that they survived at all defies logic.  The sound quality is mostly very good. Mono of course, but sometimes you get dropouts and sometimes you get some distortion. This is ALL production related and not the fault of MPI. What you see and hear is what you get basically. If you are looking for perfection, this set is NOT for you.  BUT if you want to see EVERY single episode of Dark Shadows (other than the one that had to be reconstructed from stills and audio) then THIS is the place to go. Many spent MUCH MORE money collecting each individual DVD set one by one. Others bought it first on VHS and then on DVD and paid a LOT more. And for those of you who didn't then this is your chance to purchase, own and enjoy ALL of Dark Shadows , gathered together in a very cool and functional coffin case.Watch for this set when it goes on sale. I was fortunate to snag it during the recent Gold Box special and paid less than $300.  I am 100% happy with my purchase and have ZERO buyers remorse.  The Dark Shadows Deluxe Edition is guaranteed to take you back to your school days and provide many many months or years of rewarding entertainment.  Purchase the two original Dark Shadows movies on Blu Ray and you will have it all. You could also go all out and get the full soundtrack by Robert Colbert on 8 CD's for around 50 bucks and that includes every single musical cue used in this series. For collectors, Dark Shadows never ends and new and related products are constantly being released by many original cast members to compliment your need for more DS.  In the meantime, this set should hold you over!Marty G's most HIGHEST recommendation!!Note: If you are missing a disc or have a defective disc MPI is very good about replacing them. Call them on their 800 number as they don't seem respond as well to emails.",0.7142857142857143,1312,0.013147712250474924,0.0,0.07807586233776631,0.09182630489087766,0.048382105141277436,0.366185314791652,0.1719861515585044,0.0708701473619485,0.04797061236604522,0.10244189267941592,0.0,0.03092403555407581,0.0,0.06546247478531345,0.06267313686950741,0.013320310048298444,0.0,0.03220483916662819,0.046369136793368224,0.02949151121474628,0.0,0.029913584421030787,0.19060628508349703,0.04864943621089151,0.10410002439460313,0.07308779207969315,0.0,0.02976321527009404,0.012889923462697768,0.05331512171982651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01288395474849425,0.015983655282181947,0.07461395122097463,0.12233461921007811,0.04688410278806364,0.2700506455329014,0.1969956510101943,0.0,0.012828154047351393,0.012202417227950414,0.0,0.08217046626109058,0.0,0.07916490484899637,0.03158216923039187,0.0,0.015946662115720423,0.04462446565766802,0.038839016586940216,0.029865522914168403,0.1051737459729767,0.1817263330624861,0.18067919578985359,0.042878970135910355,0.0,0.10674842376043887,0.045847437287786265,0.06505318720924773,0.0,0.0,0.04341241580883718,0.05722352971206633,0.10672054431494517,0.0,0.0694649874448408,0.03602696341545238,0.053797369581375216,0.0,0.1191616284965841,0.09856760142772186,0.44833969220576214,0.03029847537531397,0.09574148275129887,0.06548770155447375,0.02554111619168843,0.07564809698065882,0.17615699389093203,0.013627447873652285,0.22523084657305642,0.0,0.033212711911183114,0.0,0.10631573648500517,0.05837188535858684,0.030882738772535247,0.0,0.0,0.041603478075564124,0.0,0.06570108704142494,0.027135807766115575,0.04494795914691083,0.02543634934620248,0.11230268945215476,0.10514098398640252,0.02857807905981192,0.2726774491344391,

31191,0780622278,A1DZSBTVCJ883,6,6,1180137600,"not a ""B"" western","One of my favorite westerns. I own a copy. The plot is complex enough to be worthy of Cecil DeMille, though directed by Edwin Marin. Some have categorized this as a glorified ""B"" western, but I see nothing ""B"" about the cast of main characters nor the story line. Of course, we soon figure out that Wayne and Ella Raines' character were made for each other, but the ""right"" woman doesn't quite always end up with the hero, as for example in ""The Far Country"". We are kept in suspense through most of the film as to who killed Red Cardell and why, and who has been trying to ambush Wayne and why. We also wonder what Wayne's real motive is for sticking around after discovering that Red Cardell, whom he presumably never met, is deceased. It's always a treat to have Gabby Hayes back in a Wayne western. Ward Bond, another fixture in Wayne movies of the 1940s and 1950s, does well as a prime suspect for being responsible for the plot shenanigans and in  piecing things together at the end. Audrey Long is perfect as the prim naive beauty from the East, as is Elizabeth Risdon, as her scheming arrogant old battle-ax of an aunt. Wouldn't the latter and Gabby make a lovely couple! Ella's character may have been a more exciting lover and companion than Audrey's; but, if I were Wayne, I'd be extremely careful about getting into a relationship with such a hot-headed jealous tomboy who thinks nothing of using me for target practice with her pistol and knife! There are a few seemingly incongruous  details to the plot. Why does Ella's bodyguard hold off telling who killed Ella's brother? Does he want Wayne to take the blame? Jealous? Maybe he doesn't think anyone would believe him or doesn't believe the legal system will do justice. Or, perhaps he did tell the real reason to Ella. As is true of westerns in general, vigilante justice  seems to be condoned by the main characters as the most just and efficient way to rid societies of evil people or those who have done you personally wrong....As a side note, this film should not be confused with the later Clark Gable western with the somewhat similar title ""The Tall Men""",1.0,381,0.09194795969200101,0.0578836857341095,0.0,0.05351527588932709,0.042294771217551916,0.23280920335191105,0.07517360924574783,0.35401951788050356,0.04193505159114662,0.15920510376276437,0.0,0.10813295577477589,0.0,0.09810192849353819,0.08766037699738323,0.0,0.05457264786011914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08699909176311045,0.0,0.19042812146453592,0.04252846725859136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04507256245048641,0.14914280353805756,0.18550307503920366,0.11199789478375854,0.060126813453984115,0.0,0.0,0.043484121347671996,0.1711083787319461,0.05464699246056779,0.15738229712017726,0.025512603811768134,0.0,0.04485657157677902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05237215087707333,0.04613636287315358,0.11043427054304183,0.0,0.05576114754813167,0.0,0.045269831784916795,0.0,0.03677640326753689,0.2541790576045052,0.0,0.03748402899474758,0.0,0.13997634500188794,0.053438679868261736,0.045494666459071915,0.059108763353801934,0.0,0.0,0.050023786488111614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04702869856336878,0.04914796843805478,0.052084482480218824,0.06266620707537929,0.48577306661396485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044655174172929794,0.0,0.04927785417014251,0.0,0.2286496786420491,0.0,0.0,0.04808430643597011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05714805447428067,0.16681255590251792,0.04849202218939696,0.1080016580219636,0.04594777241787728,0.0,0.0,0.22236001783426224,0.04908650154457971,0.16711339677450956,0.049964891446637155,0.036672269295404486,
207204,6300208699,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,0,0,1403395200,Everyone Has Their Price,"Joseph McGrath's 1969 black comedy The Magic Christian is definitely a product of its times. Never a big hit due largely to its episodic structure and mean spirited feel the film is it times quirky and at others distasteful. The screenplay was written by the team of McGrath,Peter Sellers and then satiric hero Terry Southern.Peter Sellers plays Guy Grand, the richest man in the world.  One day he meets a young homeless man in a London park, played by Ringo Starr, and adopts him. The film then follows the adventure of the two men as the elder tries to educate the younger in the ways of the world. The premise seems to be that money will allow one to do as he pleases and that everyone has his or her price.The film has the two playing progressively larger practical jokes on those around them in order to make their point. The problem is that instead of being funny the jokes come off as increasingly more cruel as the film goes on. The culmination of the film is a set up cruise on the S.S. Magic Christian in which the morals and attitudes of the richest of British society are put to the test. The cruise is a weird piece of film making reminiscent of McGrath's earlier directorial feature Casino Royale (1967).The film features many cameo appearances by some of England's biggest stars but never really seems to quite gel. Also featured is Paul McCartney's song Come and Get It performed by Badfinger. The film is an interesting watch for historical purposes but may take some getting used to for modern  audiences.The Bluray is a bare bones affair presenting only the movie. Perhaps some contextual commentary would have helped. As it is this one is more worthy of a rent than a purchase.",0.0,302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051863220873018624,0.04098910124215876,0.15793555118313055,0.03642647295883387,0.17154534050396156,0.040640486419071614,0.038572581956018766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06338230098450774,0.16990847635465808,0.0,0.052887951011372704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3372534691734314,0.0,0.06151648951210287,0.0,0.050396040634822004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736228012789547,0.03613466450921423,0.08988823091633454,0.05427021965182106,0.058270655522803416,0.04366091339294539,0.0,0.0,0.1381884501189203,0.0,0.2542063208869884,0.074175034205482,0.11394839745750493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055691558700991316,0.0,0.08942420040649769,0.0,0.03291043389100566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955988409687095,0.10204706646471476,0.10898061026456977,0.0502245493757275,0.04521839155386912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04903840380816022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13673066654874783,0.0,0.05047659708444462,0.09109748435790749,0.6419685041315688,0.051337463345812906,0.05407450155531852,0.11096177073297678,0.0,0.0,0.023878305703402013,0.0,0.19696986558432322,0.0,0.11255063888426685,0.04659990934872458,0.0,0.03296826532140747,0.05232743397527851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05077294432783472,0.0,0.04757116597427521,0.0,0.048422439348951386,0.0,
316050,6302491975,AMS0KR29YZXCE,1,1,1135036800,Return to Basics,"Actually, I find this film to be better than ""Curse of Frankenstein"".  I realize that ""Curse"" being the first would necessarily be rougher around the edges.  Cushing has yet to find that sweet spot in his portrayal of Dr. F, and that first film, despite having color and more gore, is still not as ghoulish as Wale's original while remaining a rehash.  Don't get me wrong, I still like it, but ""Monster from Hell"" has a very subtle air of camp to it (""Kidneys!  Mmmmm, Dee-licious!"") that doesn't interfere with Hammer's usual luridly straight-faced presentation of their Frankenstein films.  True, nothing original, but what actually is anyway?  Great performances from the entire cast, as well as a little more story than Hammer's usual stretched-out-short-story manner of script.  Intelligent in a way that ""Scars of Dracula"" never could be and although perhaps the following has been done to death here, I must say it:  PETER CUSHING!!!!  Interestingly, despite the slamming it generally gets, this film has the second highest number of reviews for a Hammer Frankenstein film after ""Curse"", and the final average is quite high.  Maybe not the best Hammer Frankenstein, but a worthy final act nevertheless.",1.0,197,0.0,0.10058973459782786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1618294735734194,0.0,0.2460847397287713,0.0,0.20749886947004484,0.0,0.09395622604810878,0.09605284944133657,0.17048062550870155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09784768043263671,0.0,0.0,0.3023724367139415,0.1817723624626424,0.055154038526129226,0.14781115542797005,0.09036748321571549,0.0,0.0764345749582968,0.0,0.31330673138989595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829041346342534,0.0,0.0,0.09911685354185265,0.0,0.13674875137042505,0.1773422693305118,0.0,0.0,0.07414899451902471,0.0,0.0,0.09101184021420797,0.1603506907986979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12781938804440357,0.30919701353412027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906021129608269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17081777148455132,0.18102386546069954,0.2722518900627977,0.3069716180946294,0.092055592042574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08563459996819356,0.0,0.17659791124438134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075454246737011,0.0,0.0,0.09931136138697262,0.0,0.08426898840805927,0.0,0.07984761464752595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058081623573544294,0.08682852700350477,0.0,

487310,7883062603,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,20,21,1086048000,Powell And Pressburger's Greatest Film,"Directors Powelland Pressburger collaborated in a number of films but The Red Shoes tops them all. This 1948 TechniColor movie has become a classic and lovers of the ballet fondly look to this film for inspiration. Stars ballerina turned actress Moira Shearer as Victoria Page the tragic heroine who wears the fatal shoes, Antal Walbrook as the demanding and imperious manager/impresario Boris Lentmontov. The film is drawn from the Hans Christian Anderson tale, in which a young girl is given red shoes by a shop keep only to dance herself to death. The film never even borders on magic realism nor is over the top but maintains a subtle psychological drama that turns grotesque into a climatic and grim finale.Moira Shearer's performance is Oscar worthy. Vicky Page learns from Lentmontov all the right stuff to be a dedicated dance artist. But the ballet is second in her heart when she falls in love with a young composer/conductor. Distracted by love, Lentmontov worries that he has lost his greatest star. The crisis is even greater because apparently, cold though he is, Lentmontov falls for Vicky himself. Anton Walbrook delivers a great performance as Lentmontov. He would later take on the role of King Ludwig of Bavaria in the French Max Ophuls film &quot;Lola Montes&quot;. There is an extended ballet sequence, the original ballet &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; which makes use of magic animation and colorful backdrops. This film is genius and art. A great film to be shown in ballet history class or dance classes. This is also a caution film. Perhaps it's unwise to seek artistic perfection. It's ultimately Victoria Page's own fault for her tragedy. The Red Shoes is a metaphor. She became a slave to her art and it destroyed her. Her indecision cost her greatly. Which is greater ? Perfection in her ballet career or true love ? Torn by her love of ballet and her love for Julian, she meets a dire fate. This movie is incredible. All the scenes, dialogue are artistic composition. The film was shot in European locations, including London and Paris.",0.9523809523809523,348,0.0,0.0,0.1043340204350633,0.04772014962874586,0.037714704399340986,0.16607878530799836,0.03351655972734505,0.0947049085555963,0.0,0.070982455448149,0.05041983007358203,0.0,0.0,0.08747854941945314,0.11725155772751075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195661284321192,0.31031211985799406,0.0,0.11320454205264878,0.07584618736744468,0.0,0.0,0.0784415909185291,0.0,0.08038338169969766,0.0,0.12406132198267425,0.4494137970450279,0.0,0.04017307997781898,0.0,0.0,0.20343891970103306,0.04872931352110109,0.30406890479673787,0.06824959328440804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23623746526807937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06056279587690523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599252691659572,0.06259672010207629,0.0,0.04621238270400063,0.08321227932237596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30904243340676796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159270544014347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05588013382361121,0.37410057879810815,0.0,0.049754783098365236,0.0,0.03981950121376292,0.0,0.10985398726364892,0.0,0.1585806355127831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03033460952974147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04230568163778617,0.14015090807887393,0.039656166005556645,0.0,0.02980336424141659,0.044554233466879915,0.0,

It was the first film released in CinemaScope.  The DVD format should present the absolute finest quality in picture and sound.  Although the sound element is ok, the picture elemt used for this DVD is very poor (scratchy, full of film dirt).  There have geen several processes developed in the last decade to &quot;clean up&quot; physically dirty negatives.  Why didn't Fox do that with this transfer? Or why didn't they then wait to get a much better picture element?  Also, this DVD presents no&quot;extras&quot; outside of an original trailer (why are the trailer elements used in so many DVD's of such poor quality?).  There isn't even one of the newsreels that both AMC and Fox Movie Channel run concerning the development of the CinemaScope process.  I would love to own a widescreen copy of this film, but will have to wait until Fox decides to redo it using a much better element to present this landmark film.",0.6666666666666666,179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07480458474081145,0.1182407357547635,0.06508495188026141,0.05253949017029817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04570952811310876,0.0,0.0,0.07628259769836862,0.0,0.30219001204413065,0.07207412687746867,0.3040221144344856,0.0731056290476972,0.044363957494388276,0.0,0.07268840671309239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423720424068532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19931522672746246,0.0,0.07333057204063248,0.07132392394810677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740636633668702,0.08032636330852132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047468153720806844,0.0,0.14540995096206155,0.0,0.07298817182014794,0.0,0.28423673110814096,0.0,0.05239582860720793,0.0,0.13044091538843602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4844450631051116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05869738613500609,0.0,0.06869988631781347,0.0,0.08759591573908623,0.4012403043225604,0.0,0.0,0.08002249997265103,0.12483956048148946,0.061625309738810835,0.20664432856923415,0.0,0.21307366887553994,0.0,0.0,0.0672130810449588,0.06495609723672234,0.09510313302873896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422659658137173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06861396682351396,0.046718803342044535,0.0698417955279724,0.05126113676063563,

The enunciation of the singers was superb, and the whole cast was hilariouly funny.  So much more enjoyable than the other DVD with the American singer from Detroit.

I'll bet you that Collatine probably thinks the same way about the Matrix.  If you are so paranoid as to think this movie is ""Pro-Communist Garbage"", then you probably also think that the movie The Thing (another great John Carpenter Film"" is nothing but Propaganda on the AIDS Virus and that those infected must be from another world and are not human.  That sounds ridiculous right?  Well so is Collatine's claim about the movie They Live.  They Live is a great Sci-Fi movie that targets paranoia similar to his.  I normally don't reply to comments made by other reviewers, but this statement of stupidity infuriates me.  Now I shall continue on with the review of They Live.They Live is about a drifter who finds a pair of sunglasses that lets him see certain people as aliens and subliminal propaganda in magazines, newspapers, billboards and basically anyplace a human would read.  The drifter quickly finds a group of freedom fighters who plan to stop the aliens from furthering their control on the human race and the time to ""chew bubblegum and kick a**"" begins.It's a very enjoyable and original film; I would imagine that the creators of movies like The Matrix got some of their ideas from here.  John Carpenter does a wonderful job as a director (again) and there are only a few flaws contained within the movie.  The first one that comes to mind is that the music is simple and very repetitive.  The second is that there is a fight scene that might annoy some people as it goes on for about 5 and a half minutes.  I personally loved it and found it to be hilarious, but not all people will.  It actually took three weeks to rehearse.  The third problem is that I was hoping for a little more action as I found the middle of the movie is a little boring.  The fourth is that the ending left a little more to be desired, but it was still a good ending.As for the DVD, the extras are minimal.  They don't even list them on the back of the case, but I expected as much because it was being sold for $10.  This is the only version available and because it wasn't a big hit, I doubt a Collector's Edition will be released anytime soon.If you like Science Fiction, Horror, B-Movies, John Carpenter or anything along those lines, then this movie is for you.  If you share a similar view such as Collatine, then move along, you have nothing to see here.  And for the people who are neither; watch it sometime, you'll enjoy it.

I'll confess now, upon reading that, I had foreboding thoughts of naked girls with their naughty bits barely covered up.Boy was I wrong.There's no naughtily at all.  Ayane's High Kick is the story of Ayane Mitsui and her dream to become a Professional Wrestler.  Unfortunately, she sucks.  However, she dose have one strong point.  Her legs.  With these legs, she can deliver what's dubbed ""The Golden High Kick,"" a blow that can cause a KO instantly, which would without a doubt, make her an excellent Kick Boxer.  Just one tiny problem.  Ayane HATES kick boxing.  So, her manager tricks her into thinking he's training her to be a Pro Wrestler, all the while, training her to be the best Kick Boxer in all Japan, and defeat the nasty Sakurako Miyagawa and her gravity defying Pony Tail.Like I said in the beginning, Ayane's High Kick is not what I expected, in fact, the ending caught me by surprise, and you can't help but wonder weather or not the producers had plans for a sequel.  The animation is superb, and the voice acting to mediocre.  I say this because the actors do their best to lip sync to the obviously over done mouth movements of the animation.  The end result is that some words come out over done, and strung out a bit too long.  The characters themselves are fine, and are the typical Japanese animie characters.  My only problem with the characters are the vice principle, who seems way to obsessed with trying to get Ayane expelled, and Sakurako's motives for hating Ayane.  They just seemed too forced in my opinion.Over all, Ayane's High Kick is a fine investment, and a good watch.",0.5,299,0.0,0.0,0.16693315468633016,0.0,0.045257298797587914,0.22420464369595736,0.12065869127751895,0.0,0.04487238269219413,0.08517829442829958,0.06050333288582221,0.0,0.11828909590621774,0.03499115188190746,0.046900264031141004,0.14952005502994245,0.05839517650248008,0.0,0.05783245334794418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06792220523158012,0.045507364024391796,0.05564378334989323,0.04557822959470779,0.0,0.11136371373029612,0.0,0.039897369278301724,0.04962414887964104,0.4793710468707681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12206241733302607,0.058474728553469676,0.14033842011623518,0.0,0.0,0.09599707975454001,0.04565724793707108,0.0,0.0,0.05604054621135874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09688149360440536,0.055873256871560785,0.07870479605236855,0.13599148579059556,0.037557744526007034,0.08021917847134447,0.05545443469576778,0.04992698536153607,0.0,0.09736265993940962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19112318961295194,0.0,0.04493350157189535,0.0503228130020198,0.05259052665054731,0.0,0.13411129444506859,0.5197989300021398,0.11336647292778292,0.0,0.0,0.04778303563831386,0.047174859637676224,0.026364755099521606,0.0,0.21748034942766062,0.12123050366250407,0.0,0.051452360686712766,0.0,0.036401252754341,0.05777629279400877,0.06115097688411267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14749852089540186,0.0,0.05605993404692404,0.04758703488901231,0.0,0.14305505315541664,0.05346467084449188,0.039240970013782114,
582451,B00005J6US,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,4,17,1217894400,Attack of the Killer Snail,"16 years after his wife and daughter were killed in a botched kidnapping, businessman Michael Courtland (Cliff Robertson) meets another woman, Sandy (Genevieve Bujold), who bears an uncanny resemblance to his dead wife.Being a fan of many of Brian DePalma's other works, such as ""Carrie"" and ""The Untouchables"", I went into ""Obsession"" expecting to like it. However, what I found was a film that is slow moving and often boring. There is action at the beginning of the film and action at the end, but not much of anything during the hour or so in the middle, just Cliff Robertson and Genevieve Bujold getting to know each other. If you missed the first half hour of this film, you could be forgiven for thinking it a romance, rather than the thriller that it is meant to be. As the film progresses, the story becomes more and more unfocussed, and the ending is just plain ridiculous, as is the fact that the villain of the story waits 16 years to strike again - a killer attack snail could move faster than this guy.""Obsession"" is Brian DePalma's ""homage"" to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". However, whereas ""Vertigo"" is a great film that deserves its classic status, ""Obsession"" is a pale copy that only serves to highlight what a great film-maker Alfred Hitchcock truly was.",0.23529411764705882,219,0.0,0.08410346543046414,0.0,0.0,0.061453184673218385,0.2367859333139233,0.0,0.15431430068504035,0.12186104312781937,0.11566040388453419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047513169713126975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37922214249751096,0.07599028699952831,0.046114504537453714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278144864065712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13091783388401793,0.0,0.06318127897621001,0.08287198389341005,0.07940063565402647,0.30489642386205706,0.11120741702146443,0.08541894918363109,0.13035082576691118,0.061996260574378084,0.0,0.08349594252804245,0.0,0.13406983162107433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755738241372978,0.0,0.0,0.05343514189949814,0.22158927144949886,0.0,0.0,0.07529949216698667,0.067793976510217,0.1552899787893624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0610135125930053,0.0,0.1428213981913629,0.1513547527661108,0.22763085632765434,0.4491552712024694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488278777885834,0.0,0.07159941963135588,0.0,0.25839484187853473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885578535536642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846177724071951,0.1335217977274241,0.0,0.0,0.06461664572966562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10656767598077252,

497600,B00000F3KL,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0,3,1028937600,A 4-star movie on a 1-star DVD,"I am not well-read in modern military techniques, nor have I read the ""novelised"" account of this battle by Mark Bowden, so I cannot speak to the veracity of the film.  To a layman, it is very realistic, portraying the chaos, fear, and courage of U.S. troops under fire in a situation wherein they do not control the initiative.  Black Hawk Down tells the story of one incident in the U.N.-sponsered intervention in Somalia in the early 1990's.  At that time, U.S. Rangers and Delta Force, along with regulars from a Pakistani mountain division, were attempting to keep the peace in war-torn Mogadishu.  To that end, the U.S. special forces attempted to arrest members of one warlord's inner circle with a daylight raid into the heart of Mogadishu.  Insertion by helicopter, along with a Hummer column in support, was the method of choice.  When two of the Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by rockets, the U.S. forces lost control of the situation, with too few assets in the hostile zone to control the perimeter of both crash sites and the prisoner extraction.  A firefight lasting the rest of the day and all the following night.This film is very well organised.  It deservedly won an Oscar for Pietro Scalia's editting.  Ridley Scott shares much of the credit, as well, as he sets up the characters we accompany into battle, then clearly arranges the action such that we can follow exactly what is going on.  While the many of the soldiers are indistinguishable in the midst of the firefights, the setup is arranged such that we know which groups are involved (i.e. crash site 1, crash site 2, or the extraction team).  Authenticity is added by the use of actual U.S. Army chopper pilots and equipment, as well as actual Rangers trained in the insertion techniques (sliding down ropes from an airborn Black Hawk) used in the real battle.  The film is relentless in its action - it is so authentic and sustained that the viewer is actually exhausted at the end (much like the Normandy landings in Saving Private Ryan).  Unfortunately, I feel these sequences go on a bit long, such that the viewer becomes numbed to the action.  Finally, the soundtrack by the able Hans Zimmer, interspersed with pop music, is quite good, and captures the moods accurately.Unfortunately, this DVD edition is very dissappointing.  There is only one extra - that of an extended trailer featurette.  This one is just as annoying as usual, basically hyping the movie while giving little inside information.  The only parts of interest are the short sections dealing with the actors in boot camp (those playing Rangers and Deltas attended a week of training at their respective real-life training facilities).  The theatrical trailer isn't even included!  So, while the sound and video quality are top-notch, as expected, there is no reason to buy this DVD over the cheaper VHS tape.",0.0,486,0.0,0.0,0.025722169375334846,0.0,0.08368254279953567,0.1381877633767923,0.09915676086365773,0.1634376765957334,0.08297081763432182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14453408460694733,0.030718724411706148,0.03599166680871133,0.0,0.07128966864381846,0.03400602546808806,0.08606625606909497,0.0,0.02093180914954608,0.05609661555656346,0.0,0.028091985529558227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024590606752387584,0.030585674007956313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26331463336108707,0.07208139688513265,0.22489247050022906,0.050478096912364816,0.038772467795124374,0.02958373547332246,0.028140688213931404,0.0,0.037899596911834366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022396431483618813,0.0,0.0686073451036854,0.0,0.03443729029149094,0.04850943117954478,0.30174438949901683,0.04629717411708951,0.09888563118176576,0.06835830135904285,0.030772326235189933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308382887013004,0.0,0.03241399077577518,0.0,0.14465331384531482,0.7135653691541622,0.03493651843592138,0.0,0.03775622806664543,0.05890182034914926,0.029076062981928934,0.08124913202334048,0.03142703241499175,0.13404326766115757,0.037360002625283564,0.0382968617271545,0.031712486086571796,0.09194278693219031,0.022435787320520977,0.0,0.0,0.11001595427332177,0.12792552855379094,0.07122908348296542,0.03030340253428058,0.031289714632536735,0.03455234812843711,0.0,0.0,0.13225723724596258,0.0,0.0,

494699,B000006ND5,A29VKODW4R5U7W,103,111,1111536000,Beautiful DVD transfer from Anchor Bay,"I love this movie. It is kitschy, it is juvenile, it is everything as bad as the critics say it is, but hey, this isn't Bergman or Antonioni, or Fellini. If you want edification, look elsewhere. This movie has no pretensions, it is just good clean fun, and above all it is happy. Even the director himself, in his accompanying commentary, is befuddled by it's eventual success and he attributes it to it's happy storyline which seems so rare in our sad time. With all its adolescent antics and blatant sexual innuendo, it still retains a surprisingly innocent feel to it. It's a pleasure to watch it again after more than 20 years.Thank goodness this movie was released by Anchor Bay and not some cheap fly-by-night company. The film is transfered in it's original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). I must admit that my heart sank when the opening credits rolled and the picture came out extremely dark, grainy and grimy. But that was apparently deliberate and the picture becomes immaculately clean as the camera draws away from the TV screen showing the stock footage of the opening pirate attack. I doubt if anyone has seen this movie in this pristine a condition since it was first released. The colors are rich, lush and brilliant with well rendered blacks and pure whites. In some scenes the brilliant reds and greens are so vibrant they look like they originated from old 3-strip technicolor reels. Picture detail is well nigh perfect, so much so that the tackiness of the cheap primitive matte shots stand out all the more.The original dual channel stereo has also been remastered to 5.1 surround but I personally prefer the old stereo image. The new 5.1 sounds slightly artificial.Kristy McNichol is adorable. It's sad to learn that this was her last major film. She burnt out far too soon.Aside from the director's commentary and an old TV trailer, there are no other extras. But the beautiful transfer of this cult classic is alone worthy of the price.",0.9279279279279279,343,0.0,0.05876079641335384,0.11877728972815993,0.05432619211537481,0.04293566329345597,0.25997065374468625,0.11446907084071742,0.10781519120302772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05488574646959247,0.0,0.1327846208560577,0.1334830401934579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05234322036356495,0.08831738778213911,0.05309234002329469,0.03221894602034409,0.12951870158199683,0.0,0.04324013079398593,0.0,0.0,0.13726663907411707,0.0,0.04707850013430663,0.05684749865742033,0.0,0.04573435912754636,0.0,0.08828607125888085,0.14475098466535724,0.0,0.2929063662510995,0.414387135040215,0.059679889016842666,0.04553628257764738,0.04331509560699634,0.053788104282355136,0.0,0.0,0.09367093306722381,0.0,0.1378933682919993,0.0,0.05280136878523693,0.045955804911931186,0.10601407542572851,0.03733367559118135,0.12901531465225247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09473160306485053,0.054248435435875014,0.13855213950826464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06043961331330717,0.0,0.1705139056323615,0.09548264754808682,0.0,0.052873717913777166,0.12723157446705347,0.47071879822123847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04533183340175828,0.08950971194185654,0.20009824321690495,0.04837354734720486,0.12895244667787784,0.05750577502900784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813567961362028,0.05481245058045531,0.0,0.0,0.0984536422449647,0.0,0.0,0.04816218318900225,0.053184138612805666,0.0,0.0,0.06785826549413698,0.0,0.037227963678427664,

676580,B00005QZ7U,A2QKMTVZK2GWIH,1,1,1296000000,"An imperfect, dazzling feast","Love him or hate him, you can't deny Aussie director Baz Luhrmann's vaulting ambition which came to eye-popping, quick-cutting, over-the-top fruition in 2001's Best Picture nominee, MOULIN ROUGE!  With the goal of re-inventing the movie musical, as he did Shakespeare in his earlier kinetic interpretation of ROMEO + JULIET, Luhrmann co-wrote (with Craig Pearce) this ultimately tragic romance sprinkled with silly comedy, can-can girls and a soundtrack made up of pop songs from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Dolly Parton to Nirvana and set in the Bohemian world of the infamous 1899 Paris nightclub that in the director's hands makes Studio 54 look like Romper Room.Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a young (he was probably about 15 years too old for the part), inexperienced British writer who comes to Paris and the wild, sexy, absinthe-tinged world of the Moulin Rouge in search of love and life experience.  As the story is told in flashback, we know from the start he's going to find it, and it's not going to end well.The star of the Moulin Rouge stage is Nicole Kidman's beautiful courtesan, Satine.  When Christian is enlisted by none other than Toulouse-Letrec (John Leguizamo) and his merry prankster sidekicks to write a musical stage spectacular called SPECTACULAR, SPECTATCULAR, Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge (a rollicking Jim Broadbent), mistakes the penniless writer for a rich financier, and Christian finds himself in Satine's opulent boudoir.  Among farcically comic misunderstandings, Christian and Satine fall in love while crooning Elton John and Bernie Taupin's ""Your Song"" in the most starry-eyed of the film's dazzlingly romanticized musical number.But everything in MOULIN ROUGE! is dazzling.  With cinematic influences from Jean Renoir's FRENCH CAN-CAN to Max Ophuls' LOLA MONTES to Bob Fosse's CABARET to any number of Bollywood extravaganzas, Baz Luhrmann pumps up the visual and aural volume to eleven and pretty much pulls it off.  Backed by production designer and co-costume designer Catherine Martin, who walked off with the film's two Oscars, and Don McAlpine's stunning Oscar-nominated cinematography, Baz Luhrmann's colorful vision practically pops off the screen.Kidman (nominated for Best Actress) and McGregor make an appealing couple, and their heartfelt handling of the film's musical numbers is surprisingly effective if not always technically perfect.  The staging and choreography is fresh and exciting (though a bit ADD over-edited), and by the time Satine's tuberculosis brings the film to its inevitable tragic-opera denouement, you know that this filmmaker has taken you on a one-of-a-kind cinematic ride.",1.0,408,0.043074572363982586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039627397704769675,0.41444091048265663,0.0,0.06633856538975526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035742117216939,0.030638335221328968,0.12319794582966473,0.21820018880675987,0.0,0.052754792952790605,0.0,0.0,0.16302476689221723,0.0,0.08920926495419562,0.11953906622370586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04223000400241616,0.0,0.13035306584751655,0.0,0.11266967905823501,0.08442089856784717,0.0,0.040741739957008395,0.2671953521847837,0.0,0.14745678248481323,0.07171085706076152,0.0550814524718754,0.0,0.03997759411580304,0.1489309191951425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05173479644251108,0.03181711266930737,0.0,0.04873293387615384,0.0,0.0,0.06891410528916105,0.28577871866309523,0.032885649801652324,0.03512005105575689,0.0,0.043716186287884484,0.050068501590066025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046048389330642064,0.048799708381782464,0.05871408306365214,0.5172013302768776,0.04963197570836565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04617008365392237,0.044646283580539445,0.2856394613260097,0.05307485764969725,0.054405790732554485,0.09010361704973395,0.0,0.031873022875262585,0.0,0.0,0.05209743666970487,0.04543381116600766,0.0,0.0,0.044451205388771876,0.04908621064010602,0.08333464025644174,0.0,0.15657417796907927,0.0,0.10307845804133342,

1197434,B001GKJ2DO,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,3,6,1229299200,"Not Bad, really","Mama Mia! Not That Bad, ActuallyBy Kristin BattestellaWhen I had the opportunity to see Mama Mia! in theaters, I was a little reluctant to go. Despite being a big Bee Gees fan, I don't care for Abba all that much, and I'm not into newer musical chick flicks. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, I kind of liked Mama Mia!.As young Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) readies for her marriage to Sky (Dominic Cooper) on the Greek island of Skopelos, she confesses to her best friends Ali (Ashley Lilly) and Lisa (Rachel McDowall) that she's invited her three prospective fathers to the wedding- unbeknownst to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Donna's friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) come for the festivities and help Donna relive her glory days when she discovers her previous lovers are close at hand. Who is Sophie's Dad? Rogue Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), uptight Harry (Colin Firth), or divorcee Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?Each major cast member gets a lead turn at the music. Tony winner Christine Baranski (Chicago, Cybill) and Julie Walters (Harry Potter) could steal the show with `Does Your Mother Know' and `Take A chance on Me', respectively, if it were not for Streep's taking down the house with `The Winner Takes It All'. I knew the 14 time Oscar nominee (twice a winner with Kramer vs Kramer and Sophie's Choice) could carry a tune, but I didn't know she could sing that well. Everything the 59 year old actress has is in Donna, vocally and physically. Much was made of the impromptu split for the movie's trailers, but Streep's energy throughout the film's big dance numbers makes me envious. If it weren't for all her other star turns, I could say that this is a definitive and star making role. Streep will most likely get another nomination for Mama Mia!; despite all her dramatic and even comedic achievement, this is the complete variety package.Seyfried (Mean Girls, Veronica Mars) is cute as daughter Sophie. She's pretty, but not in a conventional way, and of course, she can sing. I'm glad, however, that the core of the film is on Donna, not necessarily Sophie's oft seen coming of age quest for her father. I'm not a Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) or Stellan Skarsgard (Pirates of the Caribbean) fan, but both fit their parts here with humor and acceptable tunes. Only Pierce Brosnan (Die Another Day) is out of place. Pierce, Pierce-if this were a straight romantic drama or comedy, he would be to die for as the days of Remington Steele. I like Brosnan a lot, which is why I can watch Mama Mia! and forgive the fact that he can't sing. Not like I can sing myself, but it's easy to pick Brosnan for last place among the cast here. Sorry!At the same time, I discovered Abba music I didn't know was Abba and music that I'd never heard before. Mama Mia! gives us the obligatory `Dancing Queen' and the eponymous track-which was stuck in my head for days after. The sound is done well, even if background singers spring up out of nowhere. It's a musical, you can take a leap of faith when people break out in song. Mama Mia! does gives us a few obvious onscreen music set ups, but for the most part the songs are fun and lighthearted. I didn't how they would work one of the few songs I knew in there, but `Fernando' has its moment. `Money, Money, Money' and `Super Trouper' aren't as upbeat, but the low songs are forgivable when considering the desire to fit every Abba song possible in one under two hour movie.While the dated and hokey nature of seventies styles are now accepted and even hip-we wouldn't be having a musical comprised of Abba's songs if they weren't-it is in fact Mama Mia's contemporary stylings that may hinder its long lasting appeal. The shabby chic look of Donna's villa, the dress of the three males leads, and the all too pretty beachy and bohemian look of Sophie and Sky trap this film in 2008. Sure maybe people copied Clueless for back to school 1995, but come 96, not so much. Mama Mia! does win production values for its great Greek locales. The crystal waters, swift boats, impressive rocks and cliffs blend perfectly with the indoor soundstages. I don't want to say `It's all Greek to me', but there were times when this Italian was out of the loop on the Greek marriage customs. I do wonder how the heck everyone climbed all those steps to that church though. Oiy.Although the script from relative newcomer Catherine Johnson is thin in some places and too obvious in others-like the obligatory father bonding montages and near blatant cues for the music-the elder cast keeps things sardonic or witty where it needs to be. Where I'm sure some actors are embarrassed by musical attempts, I don't think the cast here has anything to be ashamed of-even Brosnan! While there is definitely a hard core group of fans racking up the pre sales for this DVD release (it looks like the two disc edition has all the features) it's the music and the talent that makes Mama Mia! a successful transition from stage to screen. Instead of wallowing in Beach Bingo teeny drama, stage director Phyllida Lloyd keeps the mature members of the cast on top. Even though Lloyd lets the pace drag in between musical numbers, its rare to find a musical with adult fun and maturity that's PG-13 enough for the whole family.I don't think guys will care for Mama Mia!. Macho men might cringe at a wife or daughter's obsession with this film. Those Abba songs over and over! Young guys, however, might like the music or the hot dancing. There's nothing super naughty for tweens and younger-what there is might go over their heads, so Mama Mia! might be a parent's chance to swap out High School Musical for something they can enjoy, too. For surprising musical fun for the whole family, pick up Mama Mia! on DVD this December.",0.5,1015,0.0,0.024812109455735996,0.13374518583713485,0.0,0.0,0.29938422351358845,0.08055878772803744,0.06070084111414316,0.07190261483285784,0.08530500456162528,0.0,0.0,0.023693012248242256,0.1401728170744368,0.01878801290385397,0.11979398330987061,0.02339281776586482,0.09654294711448162,0.04633478732832942,0.11051124152491343,0.07458512567052673,0.0,0.29930227988738023,0.03646004815422582,0.022290623330028514,0.0,0.018853842766862923,0.022305875391198743,0.07728224896452647,0.0,0.03975837529931212,0.21603786887867177,0.0,0.0,0.04791544458954546,0.09319834809941568,0.1589171945560646,0.02342468592250309,0.14616907317150593,0.10936095555252341,0.10080080795198733,0.0,0.09145033414167782,0.0,0.0,0.06734869368702898,0.0,0.047338160547776495,0.029113163504567958,0.0,0.06688711292283883,0.019405122653207495,0.0,0.12611500206866713,0.23970106155194765,0.0902726758628575,0.03213540459506701,0.022214771199331036,0.1200030146440411,0.022906737144418026,0.0975074953778822,0.05067448928061226,0.0,0.0,0.021442927311762134,0.0,0.1531260016058597,0.0260300733629527,0.03600027525591627,0.04031813805621243,0.0,0.0,0.1611729560145,0.5300371248512038,0.045414046172903386,0.0,0.0,0.0957082341329534,0.05669404362126774,0.08449271990244887,0.04085205867864339,0.1960234833540412,0.07284650675866668,0.04978216275168527,0.06183468066664893,0.0,0.08749296669343766,0.02314489602510397,0.024496777715774277,0.02383499105808412,0.041572658929156084,0.06944311491889367,0.019695725039288698,0.08134711806875086,0.04491466246601374,0.019063129899594328,0.042082311576284524,0.10028750200652481,0.04283536335998666,0.015719737750072297,

No wonder, it won two Oscars.""Lion King"" is set in the idyllic African plains and valleys. The proud lion ruler of all animals, great and small, Mufasa has a naive and curious cub called Simba (Swahili name for lion). Mufasa dies trying to rescue his son and Simba is distraught and very remorseful as he feels responsible for the death of his father. He goes into exile but fortunately becomes friends with some good natured animals.Simba meets several trials and tribulations as he grows up. He eventually discovers that his evil and power hungry uncle Scar (who was second in line to the throne) was behind the death of his father and for the suffering that animals were now enduring. He returns from exile eventually manages to reclaim his throne after some epic struggle with the usurper.This is a well made film with magnificent animation and a beautiful and interesting plot. The music was wonderful (I love the ""Hakuna Matata"" song - in Swahili- no problem) and the actors were excellent. The scenery is breathtaking. It is a joy to watch.",1.0,192,0.0,0.08951863665854505,0.06031675136863588,0.0,0.0,0.3960500863661916,0.0,0.10950009208727052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05057240096202452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06727318748273829,0.0,0.14725103972523776,0.06577138894808214,0.0,0.06587381032730731,0.06802203993477732,0.0,0.06970589882283602,0.0,0.35860670763428454,0.0,0.0,0.34836810658167194,0.0,0.0,0.1323117955489108,0.08451300570304081,0.28396182060616876,0.0789118205544144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194303102927014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05251812044428463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1615062435840412,0.0,0.11792837177868669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14546222915233703,0.0,0.0,0.14537239683696326,0.3756303878823113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07620949265451299,0.0,0.19645151061574054,0.0,0.08980355635208684,0.07436363981022792,0.0718665435848526,0.15783122167787694,0.1670071254092513,0.0,0.0,0.0749941829058877,0.16702739399490893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06877711877342721,0.0,0.15506714809437738,0.0,0.0,

For another, this is a psychological study about survival under existential threat and it is done beautifully. The point is to feel the emotions, not wait for a superhero to save the race. We are all responsible for our decisions and for some, the urge to live is stronger because they love and feel more. Josh Hartnett plays just such a man. I have underestimated his acting because he is so gorgeous. Good for him for leaving Hollywood blockbusters behind. I will watch anything he chooses to act in from now on.

The only characters I liked were the main characters friends in the city, researching the Killer and finding out about werewolves. They were very cool and could take care of themselves quite well. Unfortunately they weren't in much of the movie (more towards the end). The middle dragged on and on (much like I am here, for emphasis of it's dragging) and arrived exactly where it could have been from the very start of the movie. The only saving thing was the incredible makeup effects, but even still, it looks like there were seven different concepts as to what he should look like as he changes, and they picked the best footage from all of them and meshed it into one sequence (His face changes constantly back and forth from looking wolfish, to just like a dead person). At least in the end we knew he HAD to turn into a werewolf or else everyone would be upset. Also, any movie that has the ending credits scroll over a cooking hamburger loses A LOT of points in my book.

630825,B00005JNHS,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,3,3,1299888000,"""Hello Rock Hudson""","By the early 1970's Rock Hudson's film career had pretty much stalled. Like many actors he decided to concentrate on television as that was where the work was and the money was big. Universal, his old film studio, offered him a series called ""McMillan and Wife"" where he played Stewart Mcmillan, a San Francisco police commisioner who solved crimes with his beautiful dark-haired wife Sally, portrayed by Susan Saint James. The series was actually the forerunner for the Stephanie Powers/Robert Wagner crime drama ""Hart to Hart"", and like the former what made ""McMillan and Wife"" work was the chemistry between the stars.The series was actually a telefilm (airing in 90 minutes installments) that aired as part of the powerful ""NBC Mystery Movie"" on a rotating basis with others including ""Columbo"" and ""McCloud"". ""McMillan and Wife"" actually became the most popular airing for an impressive six seasons.Rock Hudson would state he hated doing the series because he felt it was a step down from his film career and the scripts were less than Oscar worthy. However, he and Saint James remained friends until the day he died and most audiences remember his television career because of this project.Character actress Nancy Walker had a cute supporting role playing the McMillan's housekeeper Mildred.The first three seasons of ""McMillan and Wife"" are available on DVD and more are sure to follow. However, there are no bonus features.The following is a list of ""McMillan and Wife's"" episodes along with their airdates:1. ""Once Upon a Dead Man"", Sept. 17, 19712. ""Murder by the Barrel"", Sept. 29, 19713. ""The Easy Sunday Muder Case"", Oct. 20, 19714. ""Husbands, Wives, and Killers"", Nov. 10, 19715. ""Death is a Seven Point Favorite"", Dec. 8, 19716. ""The Face of Murder"", Jan. 5, 19727. ""'Til Death Do Us Part"", Feb. 16, 19728.

38433,0780631153,A2049TBN63BAJA,2,4,969580800,Too flawed for greatness,"Of course Magnolia has a lot going for it - some excellent actors, well-written scenes, excellent camera work, and a clear personal involvment of the writer/director. However, despite all these positive elements, I still feel the film fails in its goal - being a great movie. There are several reasons for this, the most important being the length. For a three-hour movie, there isn't enough substance. The William Macy-story starts off very well, then just sits there for the rest of the film. The Tom Cruise segment has not a single surprising twist or turn, and the emotional conflict in which he is thrust seems to have no bearing on his fierce (and intriguing) misogyny. The quiz kid storyline makes its point from the start and doesn't add anything to this. And the presence of TWO people dying of cancer seems a bit much - while plausible, it looks as if Anderson ran out of ideas. (Having a 60-plus year old quizmaster die of AIDS might have been more original and thought-provoking).Though this is a multiple protagonist, multi-story film, there is no juggling with time frames or deliberate confusing of the audience. In fact, it is a sign of Anderson's talent as a narrator that he can keep all the storylines immediately recognizable and easy to follow. The surrealist elements do not work for me, however. The song-singing montage made me cringe and the frog finish strikes me as silly and superfluous. I know Anderson has a to his mind solid reason for this climax, but it didn't work for me on any level, rational nor intuitive.  The music is quite obtrusive in this film - often too obtrusive for my taste. The Aim&eacute;e Mann songs are typical singer-songwriter stuff - not my cup of tea, but for fans of the genre I'm sure they're a treat.  I have a strong suspiscion that Paul Thomas Anderson was totally bowled over by Short Cuts and deliberately intended to make a similar film. In some ways he has succeeded, but on the whole Altman's work is still far superior and more mature. And the grand natural cataclysm finish didn't work there either.",0.5,360,0.0,0.0,0.07932827183275225,0.0,0.0,0.2841179865030085,0.07645092415290353,0.10801045572383813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05498515026291807,0.0,0.09976883070753034,0.044574930619158445,0.04736893076413593,0.055499920839747044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22119334938442084,0.0,0.2904956809325068,0.04325109113887225,0.0,0.0,0.044731113265578215,0.0,0.183353657638784,0.11375772637141657,0.14149129257839968,0.0,0.0,0.09163437761385217,0.0,0.04422298325651523,0.14501314374834107,0.0,0.16005646370937002,0.10378440830639725,0.11957595100153634,0.04561875351980123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21304813615312915,0.09384058086597223,0.056155359080652924,0.06907155375937243,0.0,0.05289699755386349,0.0920780713053003,0.10620607793860427,0.11220387227777384,0.28434774456177214,0.10708685064207171,0.0,0.0,0.09490317184724248,0.0,0.04626769061272509,0.060113111892243574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565557655012398,0.09996613559005241,0.0,0.06373100203833787,0.4940270959961693,0.0,0.0,0.058220912080656266,0.22706967032599013,0.04483591166825246,0.1252879012122364,0.0484611568708467,0.12918599296599292,0.05760992396645882,0.059054580760715666,0.0,0.04725924868148663,0.0345964644228406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863195202729212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05328046061738652,0.0,0.0,0.0339905819340842,0.0,0.0,

1305734,B002ZG983M,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,0,0,1281052800,Kick-Ass,"When I saw the trailers when this movie was at the theaters I thought this might be an entertaining young adult movie and so I added it to my to rent list. Had I known how entertaining I would have made a now rare visit to my local theater to enjoy this with an audience when it first released. Most kids and even some adults still have the dream of making a difference whether doning a costume or just helping their community in some way. The story here is compelling and like the music starts at a slow tempo as we are introduced first to ""Kick-Ass"", well portrayed by Aaron Johnson. He is a high school student that finally gets tired of bullies and decides to take steps to not only improve his own self-esteem but assist others that are afraid to take a stand. On his first mission to save a lost cat he drops literally into three men beating up another. His fight to defend the single man from the gang is painful for him and lands him it the hospital with broken bones but it is posted on all the usual hot amateur video sites and he becomes famous overnight.This stardom catches the attention of ""Hit Girl"", remarkably done by Chloe Moretz (some superbly choreagraphed scenes make her larger than life), and ""Big Daddy"", well played by Nicolas Cage (purposely overacted while in hero mode is good acting not bad), that have been more reclusive and deadlier against criminals. When they save Kick-Ass from certain death a bond is formed against crime. The choreography and stunts of the fight scenes are phenomenal and the music is fantastic (the CD will be a huge hit I'm sure). As the story unfolds we find out that Big Daddy not only was falsely accused of drug trafficing while he was a police officer but he ends up in jail and his wife commits suicide. Fortunately their daughter is born with her death. When Big Daddy gets out of prison he vows to avenge his wife, and he enlists the aid of his very young daughter on his quest. Enter the villains son, Red Mist, that convinces his father to get him some gear to impress Kick-Ass so that he can lure him into a trap. The events that transpire after this build to an incredible climax that is suspenseful and exhilarating.I won't spoil things for you with any more of the details but there are some absolutely hysterical/bloody scenes that will quite possibly have you laughing and crying with joy. Anyone that feels overly offended by vigilantes may be disturbed. Although I'm not saying I condone it, how can I possibly condone what criminals do to the innocent public? Keep in mind everyone has been exposed to far worse on the news every day. I highly recommend this to anyone that can appreciate unconventional heroes and can stomach some bloody killing scenes. The DVD has excellent quality picture and sound with a few extras. Superb story, casting, directing, choreography, stunts, camera work, costumes, music, and special effects.

Moving into her apartment building, the down-on-his-luck writer Paul immediately grows fond of Holly's quirky personality. Considering each other simply friends, Paul comes to one of Holly's wild parties and they journey through New York together. However, although Paul is falling for Holly, his circumstances seem to prevent it and besides she is oblivious to his affection. Slowly they fall farther apart with Holly's upcoming marriage to a wealthy man. In the end they do reconcile, embracing in the rain (of course). Holly has finally found a man who truly loves her and does not use her. The love story is an interesting one and Hepburn gives a lively performance. Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" is a wonderful addition to this film. I would say however that this is not my favorite film with Hepburn because it is certainly hard to top Roman Holiday.",0.0,160,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08884585361944172,0.2445235168180673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11877576434916641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463718430975653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827532895745283,0.0,0.0666699788083273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468097758777398,0.0,0.0,0.3528999547412399,0.0,0.2839114059088686,0.0,0.0,0.1198120518781739,0.11479335513888529,0.33060267569027646,0.107185309127314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11130257862502287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133495254648838,0.0,0.0,0.09509536834828325,0.0,0.15450755955389534,0.21357491429754696,0.07373064590880651,0.1574804855193169,0.0,0.0,0.11225513207697639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250664046004895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10324191581696661,0.0,0.06581939682409559,0.3246827946334757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27783081084658606,0.1035147582607988,0.0,0.32020626181380923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341942290550026,0.0,0.14041766355756302,0.10495797243459273,0.0,
1222420,B001OCVPOI,ADY6BU4AGA3N2,9,9,1260748800,"Plotless, inaccurate, and meaningless","First of all, this movie has no coherent plot. It is a menagerie of unexplained, random, meaningless events tied around a confusing central character who constantly makes rash, illogical decisions. For example, the main character gets imprisoned (we're not sure by who), and then her mysterious 'friend' just walks into the cell and lets her out. So how did her friend just waltz into the prison? How did he know where she was? How did he obtain her release? None of these questions are broached. This movie consists of a string of such senseless events.Secondly, the movie's events are not well-tracked to the Bible's description of future apocalyptic events. If you want to find an end-times scenario according to the Bible's description of how things will be, you will not find it in this movie. Anyone who wishes to make a Christian end-times movie in the 21st century needs to brush up on Islamic eschatology so they can understand that the Bible's depiction of the Antichrist matches the Hadith's depiction of the Islamic Mahdi. At least with this knowledge, Christian scriptwriters will start writing better scripts that take into account the fact that the Bible describes the Beast system coming out of the Middle East, not Europe. This movie depicts Jews getting rounded up and marked with a tattoo (yet earlier in the movie it was an Arab bad guy murderer who had this same mark). None of this matches the Bible's description of the mark of the Beast. It's just more nonsense.Third, the movie's portrayal of Israel is just plain ignorant. For one, you won't see a blonde American woman walking by herself through Muslim areas of Jerusalem wearing a sleeveless shirt in the middle of the night (in traditional American ""hollywood movie sexy girl"" style). Americans don't realize that their habit of excessive flesh exposure offends more traditional cultures. Also, it's a flawed script that has a woman dressed in this manner (with no protection from the sun) casually walk through the desert from the Jordanian border back to Jerusalem without getting sunburned...and without needing a drink of water.I'm longing for a Christian end-times movie that simply follows the amazing and incredible script described in the Biblical books of Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel, and Revelation. I have no clue why directors pass over this gem of a script for the nonsense portrayed in Countdown:Jerusalem.",1.0,396,0.0,0.0,0.03323083411506788,0.04559721851932417,0.07207377308190821,0.11901781622690626,0.06405101030878292,0.0,0.035730390608001934,0.03391232589679229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0746902505688695,0.03968595417658487,0.0,0.0479748506902944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04456161817127068,0.10816840017293775,0.07247201038044754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04433761650719492,0.076807358090836,0.03176895237153077,0.07902812895949284,0.19085363561314636,0.0,0.0,0.1904840379249374,0.03705026182264424,0.1943885119621541,0.13968446290745834,0.044698732424879595,0.10868894457424817,0.0,0.1528785837108625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862016161383824,0.0,0.2893426633428861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13347006595948235,0.1253400393272832,0.43314204551975233,0.029905986750804296,0.031937936087498696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752665808125965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042622325789361114,0.0,0.05072835308643659,0.0,0.07155811509106141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601825660229751,0.5267801053327305,0.04513498188124737,0.0,0.04877780460059005,0.0,0.03756377666178743,0.1889404233349705,0.0,0.1298792938172886,0.0,0.0,0.08193961785585568,0.0,0.05797022139229813,0.0,0.0,0.04737705534761176,0.041317199537316114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15156791259554003,0.12547116127586247,0.0854324969116363,0.0,0.09373885019971741,

The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous and they sound great in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono.",0.75,297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08653341150694381,0.33342282772594994,0.03845055000927023,0.072430978440972,0.04289871976415491,0.040715909914272805,0.057842159621217824,0.0,0.0,0.06690420827900688,0.08967481389780477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055288755813686634,0.0,0.0,0.05350169247068061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08714704151735675,0.044994509265801334,0.05323275097716841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05728580412093866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14586704340016318,0.0,0.0,0.026098883865592164,0.24056013108199958,0.0,0.04364906356523098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04719657724829473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20801607721202306,0.03590580799880669,0.03834541259552475,0.0,0.0,0.05466670160765778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4453729965751305,0.0,0.24848205039183968,0.0,0.04810941882729919,0.0,0.0,0.06410627754126229,0.5872881650386164,0.05419008598384074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04509992476646574,0.0,0.0,0.10395735644689373,0.0,0.05940231948733473,0.049189284586117536,0.04753753142849422,0.139200733037454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055241768946892894,0.0,0.14560056945487856,0.053594198845481646,0.0,0.0,0.13676293229750996,0.0,0.0,

[Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl.]  You've heard music that's so cacophonous that it actually becomes quite listenable in spite of itself.  [Webern springs to mind.]  You've seen video sights so austere that they seem somehow friendly.  [A howling blizzard in Antarctica perhaps, viewed from the warm safety of your living room.]In the same fashion, there are movies so bad that they become not only Good, but even Great.  This movie is almost one of those.  Almost.First there's the humor.  Early on, it's so strained-at that when you finally get to things that really are funny, such as the Alan Arkin character's diatribe about 'Lots of 'em,' you have forgotten how to laugh.Some reviewers have remarked on how well dysfuntionality is captured here.  Yes, the teenager's angst is well portrayed, but all of the other bickering, shouting, intervening, and sulking seems contrived.The satire on tiny tot beauty pageants is so over the top that you want to crawl under your chair and hide, especially from the smarmy M.C., who must be every little kid's worst nightmare.  The point is made in the first five seconds.  After that it's just painful.On the other hand-- and it's a big one-- Miss Breslin is fantastic.  She rescues the movie from going down the tubes.  She's not all that functional herself, but in comparison with the rest of her assorted relatives, she's eminently sane.  And, yes, as other reviewers have said, her act in the talent competition is wonderful, amazing, and memorable-- getting the movie's point across very nicely.  And in the nick of time, too.But the highlight of the movie comes a little earlier, in a scene between the Breslin character and the Arkin one-- that is, between granddaughter and grandfather.  He tells her she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and she shyly demurs.  But he insists, and then comes up with a great line to the effect that ""And I'm saying that, not because of the brilliance of your mind, or your precocious intellect, or because of your accomplishments, but because you're goddamned gorgeous.""  The fact that she is anything BUT gorgeous gives the scene a powerful poignancy that makes up for many shortcomings earlier and later in the plot.  A wonderful and memorable moment in an otherwise rather forgettable film.",0.6666666666666666,394,0.035510959942818304,0.04471018720441415,0.060250543259282134,0.0,0.03266908654695925,0.23377270836492253,0.08709775732788964,0.054689948360100785,0.0323912339597629,0.030743075111995033,0.13102341529042547,0.0,0.0,0.17680911139312835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039827152186198866,0.03359967173834041,0.08079429165199191,0.024514901022871953,0.09854879014008265,0.04016659461246497,0.03290075119034827,0.06794737393310653,0.0,0.0,0.0864000268185449,0.07164261489926076,0.12976316501208954,0.0,0.0,0.08634124806692153,0.0,0.26433312075153403,0.0,0.18234650776800893,0.07882520112737267,0.0,0.03464785780502176,0.0,0.0,0.04438722235915816,0.0,0.0,0.042650505467490864,0.10492094537339214,0.04307070833502238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08521986051560294,0.21596469567013848,0.10844458145116721,0.08685960123008925,0.040029912845467766,0.07207982133886086,0.12383040319038335,0.0,0.04565645468931465,0.0,0.039084532463126244,0.0,0.0,0.2759254391439379,0.0,0.19461211659257255,0.036325639773645786,0.0,0.0,0.3630320634644399,0.4946056354849035,0.0,0.0,0.04421931173927529,0.06898459113638979,0.10215984691684948,0.019031459875408253,0.03680668897713595,0.0981179354833404,0.04375526071490692,0.0,0.07428201280139902,0.07178765757278173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07491186376650995,0.0,0.0,0.03664586523650683,0.0,0.06870162394160252,0.0,0.05163231165669178,0.0,0.1982832992110974,
824432,B00024JBAE,A328S9RN3U5M68,11,13,1095984000,"Fascinatingly bold, provocative view of Dysfunctional Family","If you like to become so involved in a film that you feel as though you are inside the minds of the actors and the writer and the atmosphere of a film, then MY FATHER AND I is definitely a classic film to treasure.  On the other hand, if you favor stories that are linear and clear with a start and an undisputed finish that brings assured closure, then this film will be frustrating. Anne Fontaine has gathered an accomplished cast of French actors and directed them in a mind excursion that asks as many questions as it answers: are we observing  a family out of sync and falling into disrepair before our eyes, or are we privy to the instant mental response to a letter that triggers a life in a flashing moment that is resolved by psychological hypothesis?  It is this kind of storytelling that the French do so well, and in this reviewer's opinion this is one of the finest films to challenge our minds that has come along in years.Jean-Luc (impeccably portrayed by the exquisite Charles Berling) is a wealthy physician whose practice in Versailles caters to the aging wealthy, a clientele who see him as a god with his Human Growth Hormone injections, Botox treatment, and other battlements against aging (Gerontology, his specialty).  He is married to a phenomenally beautiful wealthy wife (Natacha Regnier, as beautiful as she is talented), lives in a magnificent home, uses his younger brother as his aide/chauffeur allowing that brother to pursue his dreams of being a standup comedian, and maintains a mistress on the side.  His marriage is childless: his wife depends on her husband to be her doctor and has been informed that for her health she should not have the children she yearns to bear. As the story opens, Jean-Luc is readying himself for a party honoring him for his contributions to the town, a party of great elegance given in his own home.  As he prepares to dress he notices a letter announcing that his father has died. Pregnant pause....  At the party that commences his father appears and gradually we discover that the father Maurice (played with great subtlety and nuance by Michele Bouquet) and his sons have not seen each other for many years: the disillusioned Maurice left his family when his two sons were very young to go off to Africa to treat the indigenous population - a physician to the poor in contrast to Jean-Luc's physician to the wealthy.  This history has profoundly affected Jean-Luc who avoids intimacy with his wife, does not want children to remind him of the childhood he remembers with loathing for his deserting father, and in many ways has brought him to a life that mimics that of the very father that he no longer knows.  Maurice ingratiates himself into staying with Jean-Luc and his wife, gently alludes to the fact that after leaving Africa following one of the many government overthrows he is without pension or support, and gently requests support form his wealthy son.  Maurice befriends Jean-Luc's wife, attempts reconnection with the other son, and finally has a confrontation with Jean-Luc over the differences (and very real similarities) between their life choices.  At this point a significant scene brings closure to the tale and we are returned to the image of Jean-Luc reading the letter that initiated  the pregnant pause at the beginning of the film.  It is up to us, the viewer to decide if we have observed fact, or if we have entered the imaginative brain of Jean-Luc reacting to a letter.  This is movie making at its finest.  The direction is brilliant, tense, revelatory, and kaleidoscopic. The acting is so very fine that it defies description.  An outstanding movie visually, psychologically, and technically.  Highly Recommended.",0.8461538461538461,633,0.0,0.02951937249667679,0.0,0.0,0.06470813444574341,0.2612003592364504,0.09584210754297241,0.1624877631440336,0.08554371705165639,0.04059550373945638,0.0,0.027572682701520735,0.0,0.0,0.06705721885968333,0.0,0.02783081795642348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11091893009477398,0.0,0.08092836781299297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044861450302859235,0.0,0.16090192261204203,0.07605946160826894,0.14190356838665508,0.08567459551950674,0.12265326790276897,0.41355621395506464,0.0,0.0887036794200695,0.14543568148869973,0.05573746404735247,0.1872766402661219,0.052043407100175444,0.02998109253073612,0.0,0.021759991695100882,0.0,0.11722455510393824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03463640685533585,0.0,0.0,0.023086591850065716,0.026628885016878982,0.05626540535769794,0.18147581070505792,0.05369943957851224,0.03823201651860775,0.0,0.0713847747673603,0.10901007955907074,0.023201252456286285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02551100138681436,0.0,0.09108825447497647,0.0,0.06424517454822541,0.0,0.025064353960496343,0.0,0.30360432855018155,0.40538175286997863,0.02701491680807694,0.028455207284297995,0.05839055554880198,0.0,0.0,0.08795707462696295,0.0,0.33686227568353133,0.0,0.02961332668185256,0.02452191036085535,0.09479390434516484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17014127253155995,0.024729836187373306,0.027539203257148044,0.0,0.024194999261212293,0.0,0.04535943495353,0.025033007232973862,0.13635849330623379,0.0,0.0748081165807015,

794716,B000189LE2,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,3,3,1146700800,Solid True-Story Irish Crime Tale,"Cate Blanchett has done it again - played someone you can't take your eyes off of, and not because she's a classic beauty but she's just a good actress and plays such intense roles. Here, she's the single-minded outraged Irish reporter out to expose the drug trafficking in Ireland in the mid 1990s. Yes, it's based on a real person, a very real Veronica Guerin, who took her life in her hands with her desire to have this problem taken care off so the kids in her country wouldn't have such easy access to harmful drugs.According to the film story, the drug problem was ignored or the police were just ineffective in dealing with it, so Guerin goes after the mob as an investigative reporter. Her husband pleads with her to stop, knowing she could easily be killed. The gangsters were tough and realistically portrayed on film. There is no talk-now-shoot-later nonsense. You mess with them, you will pay. That's the message they give Guerin and you'll have to see the film to find out what happened.Yup, this is an attention-getter from the start and especially with Blanchett in the lead.

She is my favorite Bond girl and she did a great job in this. Yaphet Kotto is a underrated Bond villain. He was cool and very menacing. I liked the voodoo stuff. It was cool how they had the tarot cards determine character's fate and reveal the truth. The cards determine life, love and character in the movie. My sister and I like playing tarot cards they are fun. This is Roger Moore's first outing as Bond and he did a great job. He is a more light hearted Bond than Connery and has more humor to him. It's a different type of Bond movie which makes it unique and good. I liked the fighting scenes. It had a real exciting ending. It had characters you liked. I thought Seymour was a likable character. It's important to care about the characters in the movie. It was a very fun movie. I have this one as a top three Moore Bond's. This is a must own for any true Bond fan and also a great introduction to new Bond fans.

This movie stands the test of time. Not only does it benefit from the mastery of pantomime performed by Chaplin, it includes sound effects and other technological advances that came with the sound revolution.Of all the silent movies I have seen, this music score is one of the best, probably because Chaplin took the time to write it himself. It suits the scenes well and demonstrates Chaplin's ability to be a jack-of-all-trades when it came to the movie industry.The jokes are still funny, the characters are still likeable, and the end is still satisfying. In fact, the ending is incredible and probably the most memorable part of the film.I definitely recommend this marvel.

But I think the worst thing about it is the constant talk about sex. They mention sex in every episode! It gets annoying. And the acting is bad. it kind of funny, but you can watch a much cleaner show and get ""funny"". For example, Full House. Full house is definitly cleaner than ""the facts of life"" and more interesting too. And it's a bit funny. It isn't the cleanest show around, but cleaner than the facts of life. Although the earlier seasons aren't clean, the later ones are cleaner. So instead of being bored on a saturday night watching the ""facts of life"", I reccomend season 6 or 7 of Full house.",0.09090909090909091,131,0.18932477625854385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19174563735040587,0.07739283611442953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20199606086731417,0.0,0.09590507730717339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10768760697128399,0.06534993926704911,0.0,0.10707302126326347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058719910022839585,0.0,0.16202843591713412,0.2626577046742275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899934834356671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10709742774184781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4186924288197501,0.07227080791660591,0.07718121670639667,0.0,0.09607242432836216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25007094305174615,0.0864636708648544,0.0,0.0,0.3217325221290578,0.0,0.5001137461732956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18389382184000158,0.09077662310116927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11663941158339969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11117652061768563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881872433084928,0.0,0.07550976881382093,

The deep textures of colour and lighting lay subtle to the senses and tickle the eyes with splendid indulgence.  The dark blues and purple worked  brilliantly.  The costumes in &quot;Wings of the Dove&quot;  were superb,  transforming  Helena Bonham Carter into a lavish china doll.  Beautiful to  look at indeed.I wish the script could have been a bit more agressive,  making Helena's character more ploying and devious.  This would have made  her more dynamic of a villian.  Like maybe help her dying friend along by  slipping some cyanide into her glass of wine?Linus Roach (Was he also in  Pulp Fiction?) looked gorgeous in this film.  You would have thought the  filmakers opted for Hugh Grant, but it was nice to see someone less famous  play the role.The Wings of the Dove casts you into the stylish world of  Great Britain and offers intoxicating glimpses of Venice as well.  A  dreamy, magical place where love lives and dies in the same breathe.  A  beautiful escape.",0.8,174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08824999171110333,0.0,0.23035004407224474,0.0,0.05838000271760549,0.06915348737016319,0.0,0.0,0.0891589578138029,0.0,0.053925377583167296,0.07227868505629914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434668699615024,0.0,0.05233795354545318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253193674183249,0.0,0.0,0.18445926360200143,0.07647650396332353,0.27703715776691645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23514022793577288,0.2703487864841767,0.0,0.04207185775466085,0.0,0.0,0.07036305471520903,0.1747517936465278,0.0,0.0,0.22824512665634625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29340986377770095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28575970945926854,0.0,0.08249231027162257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775532254936761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5097716641365501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189333278547122,0.0,0.12568580908024166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11219700945558818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07996633643670319,0.08905069876622428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11023212071756158,0.16479037742908478,0.12094966932580972,

603887,B00005JLQW,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,7,11,1046736000,The art of Almodovar: extreeeemely adicting,"You could spend hours on end talking about Almodovar's art, the result of a work that has evolved from some more-sexually loaded works back in the seventies and eighties to his more mature and hilarious works from the past decade. Starting with ""La Flor de mi Secreto"" in 1995, you start to see a trend in his work. With the help of some of today's greatest Spanish-speaking stars, such as Marisa Paredes, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Cecilia Roth and this time around, the brilliant Argentinian star from ""El Lado Oscuro del Corazon"" Dar&iacute;o Grandinetti, charming Leonor Watling, the sexy Spanish singer Rosario Flores and most-peculiar Javier C&aacute;mara, Almodovar is on a trip to the unknown to tell the stories flowing from his heart, from his childhood, his forbidden places...The plot was beautifully summed up by a reviewer on another site with these words: ""Marco [Grandinetti] is Sancho to Benigno's [C&aacute;mara's] Quixote, and as Benigno's hopes for his patient [he plays a male nurse] become fantasies, Marco tries to inject reality."" As hipnotizing the movie can result there's more to it than a brilliant storyline: direction is impeccable (as usual with Almodovar), filled with details to embellish the story; the music is... well, what else can be said about Alberto Iglesias, Almodovar's long time scorer? This is his most brilliant accomplishment so far!The best advise I can give you is, get up, grab your keys and shoot for a theater that is playing it: you will laugh, you will cry and you will come back home craving for more.

636758,B00005JNZU,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,2,3,1124755200,"Sharp Script and Carell's Skillful Underplaying Make for a Hilarious, Humane Comedy","The very concept of this movie sent a chill up my spine, as I was preparing myself for the return of Pee Wee Herman and the inevitable man-child clich&eacute;s that would come with a character bearing the movie's title. Contrary to my expectations, this film is a frequently hilarious, surprisingly humane comedy that goes well beyond the inevitable deflowering process. First-time director Judd Apatow smartly averts the movie from being a one-joke premise and provides instead a perceptive overview of the romantic anxieties and social pressures faced by those looking unsuccessfully for intimacy. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of crude humor and graphic sex jokes, but more importantly, it has a heart thanks primarily to a thoughtful script by Apatow and Steve Carell.In a sharply comic performance, Carell plays the title character, Andy Stitzer, as a socially clueless, emotionally inert loner in a paralyzing state of arrested development. Surrounded by his exhaustive action figure collection and working in a Circuit City-type electronics store, he rides a bike, doesn't know how to drive and doesn't seem to want to despite living in LA (the one plot contrivance) and can talk endlessly about making egg salad as the highlight of his weekend. Andy works with a trio of co-workers who all think of themselves erroneously as wise in the ways of love, and upon discovering Andy's virginity, they are determined to help him get a woman.But the film doesn't focus so much on the pursuit as it does in peeling off the layers of Andy's personality - the fundamental terror that has kept him from women, a constant need for order and logic to fill the void, and finally an eagerness for life to stay simple and uncomplicated so that he can live without confronting his fear. In short, he has rationalized sex and intimacy out of his life, that is, until he meets Trish, a nice, eccentric single mom running an eBay transaction store. Their burgeoning relationship is the heart of the story, and it certainly helps to have the always wonderful Catherine Keener play Trish in such a warm, loopy fashion that it's easy to believe the mutual attraction.The supporting performances are terrific - Paul Rudd portrays Andy's closest colleague David, who cannot get over his failed relationship which he faces again in a chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend at a speed dating event; Romany Malco plays Jay, a married philanderer who eventually gets caught; Seth Rogen as Cal, who thinks he's a ladies' man despite all the evidence to the contrary; and Jane Lynch from ""Best in Show"" as their manager, a power-driven woman who in a very funny scene, discreetly offers herself to Andy and serenades him with a Guatemalan folk song.There are several great scenes, including the poker scene where Andy awkwardly talks about women knowingly, the already famous chest hair-waxing where Andy yells out a series of Tourette-like epithets, and the surreal musical production number at the end, which will get any baby boomer giggling with abandon. Truth be told, it runs a bit too long and sags toward the last third, but I doubt if I have laughed at a film so much in the past year.",0.6666666666666666,536,0.07135213720699805,0.0,0.060530678927786866,0.0,0.06564196376215821,0.3251902673780878,0.08750271946025269,0.19230480490121998,0.09762551224421584,0.030886015431409716,0.0,0.0,0.04289213427021985,0.0761276518325071,0.10203742314814948,0.07228881892905846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126768152049107,0.04058497287019286,0.09851553347003739,0.09900699399539763,0.12106004911757168,0.0,0.034131648056945255,0.0,0.104929690805892,0.08680174484401534,0.21592715444998803,0.0,0.13997624279295914,0.20976220565295128,0.043371346399918714,0.033743924314557285,0.2655621409641985,0.0,0.061064776726352625,0.11878754985642766,0.045620642743980803,0.0,0.0331110284328859,0.04111683064036514,0.0,0.0,0.035802078751764686,0.0,0.07905658248423651,0.0,0.08072509588832047,0.07025929144431264,0.0,0.028538697114270657,0.2564177037785412,0.02723719897856505,0.058175637368427575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07060823740402604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04826402986630129,0.0,0.047122982508493436,0.09775848405406053,0.0,0.03813910171779885,0.0,0.17020265997873588,0.4969053106886026,0.08221434006757194,0.0,0.0,0.03465266793588754,0.03421161347555154,0.03823989378113771,0.03697782214646995,0.2562927537935428,0.043958701357063805,0.0,0.03731369398315373,0.07212143520127542,0.026398501210648528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03763008371575263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131029153276144,0.1725526325435263,0.0380914030605191,0.1296809418688997,0.038773038596780995,0.0,
841627,B0002NY7UO,A3N0O8HJTGD1FM,2,2,1107475200,Only for Ramones fans? Who do you THINK is gonna buy it?,"I've seen reviews here and elsewhere that complain that ""Ramones Raw"" is strictly for Ramones fans. Well, as we used to say in junior high, no duh, Sherlock. Of COURSE it's for Ramones fans! Yes, the bulk of the material consists of Marky Ramone's home videos, shot on the road. And, no, this is not an in-depth documentary (such as ""End of the Century"") that explores the history and impact of the Ramones. But what it IS is a glimpse into the everyday life of the band that singlehandedly re-invented rock-n-roll. It's a peek into the dressing room before showtime, a ride in the van. It's an all-access pass to hang with the Ramones from concert stages in Europe and South America to the airports, highways and Holiday Inns they called home for twenty-plus years.In showing the band in its everyday life, ""Raw"" even calls into question certain impressions one might get from viewing only ""End of the Century."" To watch 'EOTC,' you'd think that these guys never actually enjoyed being Ramones even for a minute. But ""Raw"" shows them hanging out, joking around, goofing off...just acting like bandmates. You may get a sense of the rift between Johnny and Joey, but the rest of the lads seem to get on just fine.Of course, in addition to the home movies, ""Raw"" sports some pretty amazing concert footage of the Ramones at their peak, GREAT commentary by Johnny and Marky (you've never heard either of them talk this much anywhere else) and clips from various TV appearances over the years. For Ramones fans only? Probably so...but it's a look at the band that any true fan is going to love.",1.0,279,0.0,0.0,0.04568927596703578,0.0,0.09909466903304939,0.21818442601653448,0.0,0.08294511578076523,0.09825186278780525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15323215070041202,0.05134603992291571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080712629498393,0.0,0.0,0.1859017392288837,0.1494633118759161,0.18275512816614195,0.0,0.05152594733470402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338577041120378,0.1920530177481222,0.15364139778024666,0.1494370910469256,0.06887000684760027,0.1050968473500941,0.04998519568654717,0.06207094502471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06532287918952093,0.06093226193459697,0.0,0.1223392037215655,0.04308269562775358,0.3573177799055901,0.08223584620191361,0.04391166260426858,0.12142215727830491,0.0,0.0,0.05329593689420187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049192843862350545,0.05509301959834338,0.0,0.0,0.2202359844110307,0.5432048784078979,0.06205636114335188,0.1307297469904024,0.0,0.0,0.051646665031688084,0.05772785274722891,0.0,0.20833380297506018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06325303061043493,0.0,0.0651390015907261,0.05680726897521822,0.0,0.05382673991940049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039153886562427916,0.0,0.12888211535037983,

Most viewers are probably not aware that the ideas are all lifted from well-known science fiction writers.  A teenage boy of the 1980s travels back to the 1950s and, of course, we get the usual jokes about the absurdity of Ronald Reagan being president, or of a colored boy ever becoming a mayor, etc.  The &quot;circle in time&quot; gimmick also gets a workout two or three times.

And he's not even the main character!The Spoilers is set in Alaska 1890s during a gold rush.  Along side Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott this film really shines bright with great acting.The War Wagon is a good, old fashion action film with lots of action and Kirk Douglas to boot!Hellfighters is about firefighters and how they handle the job and their lives, trying to balance the two together.  Lots of action, romance and gritty reality.Rooster Cogburn, named after the character John Wayne played in True Grit, brings that character back to match him up with Katharine Hepburn to bring justice to the West.Outside of Rooster Cogburn I have never seen any of this films and it really allowed me to enjoy and come to respect the many skills and sides of John Wayne.  I look forward to buying up more and more of his films in the future.

As a matter of further agreement the releases should be excelerated since most of us baby boomers who watched the show back then won't be around for the availabilty of the last season.If memory serves this is the last season of the concise story telling represented by the 30 minute episodes. The show went to an hour in length in the 1962 season and Big Jim was rewarded with his own production company to partner with the CBS network as a means of greater financial incentive to do an hour. People in their reviews have remarked about the great character development of the stars, which began in season one and made the show the success it became instantly. When the show became an hour the beer timeouts in the Long Branch, a source of great comic relief with Doc and Chester, and later outright hilarity with Doc and Festus, became more numerous and longer duration.Guest stars got more air time, extra secondary characters were introduced..and grabbed more air time...and besides slowing the pace of the show with outright filler, the ultimate consequence was less of MATT DILLON!What the Duke was to movie westerns was what Jim Arness was to television westerns....yet the show lasted another 13 seasons until 1975. The last six or seven thanks to Mrs. Paley who loved the show and was the wife of the chairman of CBS network. They moved it to Monday nights and it rose again phoenix-like to the top 20 list....the rest is tv legend and "" get out of Dodge "" became part of the English language and lore.Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series",0.9166666666666666,322,0.037659057362820776,0.0,0.031947582780021355,0.0,0.10393582766368219,0.22884358081655032,0.0,0.057998204097528684,0.0,0.09780827364422784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03590299531222919,0.0,0.04470255747032162,0.0,0.044271782778606224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07799350386619867,0.0,0.04259631654609495,0.0,0.07205758607258905,0.0,0.0,0.030542153477388322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036903575442640654,0.0,0.03561951838168519,0.14016146245137828,0.0,0.10743158367324575,0.0626950688394152,0.0,0.0,0.03495144414465398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11337621466133443,0.09046096385678648,0.02781693248183404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3955949237233195,0.0,0.061409223340303846,0.04245136674715716,0.03822000490655566,0.0,0.03726643330909353,0.04841826435828732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0509466973364232,0.0,0.3979378156528166,0.0,0.0,0.04025899364977048,0.0,0.0,0.633047268829871,0.043392036592668264,0.0,0.046894187034518676,0.0,0.03611320318584898,0.0201826940274299,0.0780663329719866,0.16648511745730796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16719488054019552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04423415863008768,0.07527517969837916,0.038862614338616604,0.042914887386437284,0.0728574615020789,0.0,0.16426682265858883,0.0,0.0,
1186883,B001EZ79V8,ANJFW8DZ4ZCNK,12,14,1234310400,A Glorious Tristan,"This DVD was my fourth Tristan in a year's period. And although the others had much to recommend them (notably Meier's Bayreuth performance)I can say unequivocally that this is performance to own if your budget only will permit just one performance.Where to begin. Obviously Barenboim (he conducts three of my DVD's) owns this score today as Furtwaengler did in his. His approach is both magisterial and passionate. I would judge his tempos were faster than Furtwaengler's but this is really a niggling point. Meier almost trumps her early Bayreuth performance, perhaps not vocally (she touches the C's but only just); dramatically the Chereau staging and direction are preferable to Muller's who has straitjacketed his artists with a vaguely a la Kabuki manner. Visually she is a beautiful woman, but more immportant her acting skills are incomparable. As an intrument her voice is not why you want to see a Meier performance; in fact it is not extraordinary nor idyiosyncratic, but her utter involvement with the text and incorportating it with her interpretation make her the Isolde of her generation. Interestingly in the wrong role she cannot summon up her great skills to cover up her shortcommings, e.g., her Eboli from the Chatelet. She clearly does not have the skills to negotiate the agility required for the Veil Song. O don fatal is another matter altogether, but it is a different kind of music. She also came to grief in a Carmen directed by Zefirelli. I can understand her wanting to do it, but when your director has other ideas it took guts to stay with the produdction.Ian Storey was a name new to me (he sang Otello recently in LA). The voice is not beautiful (for that go to Jerusalem/Meier)but it is virile and even better there is no wobble as he ascends the scale and increases the volume. His instincts are also musical and he has the physique du role. He reminds me of Set Swanholm (not physicaly, but vocally)whose voice (by the time I saw hims as Tristan)was vaguely ""leathery"" but he looked wonderful (unlike Melchior) and was always dramatically involved and musically nuanced.Why did Glyndebourne in their recent taping select Robert Gambill who manages to scupper the performance whenever he is singing: ah, the politics of casting! Gambill sang the first performances and anlthough I don't remember reading any reviews at the time, the DVD was a taping of the 2007 revival. Was Gambill already inked in for these performances? Promised because there was going to be a taping? Gambill is appearing in the new Tannhauser from Arthaus. Given the difficulties of this role, I can't imagine that will sings the role with distinction. And why was the usual cut in the Act II obsserved? Surely this is retrograde in the 21st century. Stimme is very good and would probably be better heard in the house. A plus is the presence of Pape, Bo Skovhus and Katerina Karneus--the Brangane.The presence of Matti Salminin is outstanding; the man is a vocal miracle considering how long he has been singing and the number of times he has sung this role. Rene Pape is knocking at the door, but Salminin need not worry. Isn't it wonderful that we have two great Marks!My only complaint is the booklet that accompanies the set. Virgin should provide a magnifying glass. The copy is white on black and the font size is miniscule. There is no listing of cue points either. Apparently Virgin is aping Opus Arte and taking 3 discs when DGG can put it in two although the price is far less than OA--even if there are two bonuses.In short a highly recommendable performance that justifies the medium; who would have thought that a performance that took place on December 7, 2007 would become available in January 2009.",0.8571428571428571,636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05779954345961196,0.022840379933375093,0.2011577508413084,0.08119177603795259,0.07647224523929229,0.04529224219895966,0.04298764306549685,0.030534723615040397,0.029197436492927355,0.0,0.17659277608759874,0.04733909790939444,0.10061271751449301,0.029470782681007664,0.060813456554743496,0.08756036542441437,0.05568979018066864,0.0,0.028243402446022376,0.05141830206240626,0.04593316489047338,0.0,0.023002346765980876,0.047504965707457505,0.028101428940420437,0.12170233119888159,0.06040601826906736,0.22539811255982478,0.33265127514053106,0.0,0.12164597660260101,0.03018246174308523,0.04696532569196872,0.23100848328975185,0.0,0.35412882782072486,0.11022025605068378,0.0,0.048447650044130874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05656490339231282,0.02491494873790885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028088615187199788,0.07334099188069762,0.056396048768581175,0.13902212952637544,0.15099031600443735,0.03790916281819097,0.020242442245872447,0.08395996166983215,0.0,0.028858407698930423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02732569732835786,0.027014268104619814,0.0,0.160759567363271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05625420515279828,0.1353661398212021,0.4888901097334592,0.028606803567287228,0.030131964907808985,0.0,0.09646025877331049,0.0,0.09314005199729011,0.05146631566321541,0.19207585067278593,0.0,0.09407498368920195,0.051933787379118,0.02509493755101612,0.1469674001850552,0.0,0.0,0.030027842250862306,0.0,0.029161984231663125,0.0,0.05124143791323635,0.0,0.07204844206206223,0.053016215130306035,0.09024598938373424,0.10792985242558231,0.01980406891002368,
1163474,B0019H6IX6,AYW23ZT2ZCXN4,1,2,1237680000,Mitama of the Kushinada,"Blue Seed is a good series.It begins with a mysterious glow-girl talking to one of the cast members in the beganing, in which she then disappears after everyone has ran-away. Afterwards, the story begans with an ordinary school-girl name Momiji who is suddenly attacked by a gigantic 7-headed dragon inside of her school!(After she meets a mysterious young-man with a red jacket that is trying to rid of her...) She tries to escape from this treacherous beast, not knowing or understanding what it wants from her! Blue Seed has fanservice in it, so be warned of pantie-shots, wet clothes exposing the shape of momiji's chest, and her skirt being ripped by the aragami monster in the begining. Kusanagi will also refer to/lift Momiji's skirt for her panties time and time again as a joke, in which she will yell ""pervert!"" and try to slap him. Other than that this is a pretty clean anime. There are a cast of supporting characters whose personalities support the backbone of the main characters. This is a story of the sacrifice of love. How far will you go to sacrifice those who you love? Will you choose between yourself, or for others? Blue Seed ask this question, with a very interesting twist. A must see for anyone that has watched ""Slayers"" or OutLaw Star. The voice of Momiji is the popular J-Pop singer Megumi Hayashiba",0.5,231,0.0,0.15040420739110294,0.0,0.0695266943644831,0.054949088513340454,0.0907392556108374,0.04883252928671307,0.045993982857609306,0.0,0.0517095558540655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113887785087322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370148130085565,0.1105054097447983,0.0,0.055338746209361335,0.0,0.0,0.17567392982518643,0.0,0.0,0.3637673202040288,0.07811636047192971,0.0,0.07261257328945964,0.0,0.18525239995493908,0.0,0.20447004501825103,0.09943742108316656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13767609844408285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04777966117739781,0.3302277594245808,0.0,0.04869900386680054,0.0,0.18185634653795443,0.06942718131783153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06499057430453674,0.0808039338598453,0.3094026184215182,0.0,0.054555950546920265,0.0,0.12770543451162103,0.0676678169803972,0.12212328593769554,0.31555658614947585,0.0,0.0,0.07437645589716045,0.05801570850414406,0.0,0.12804292788887078,0.12381699179623279,0.1980401054876311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06037307386085023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059695043640122576,0.0,0.13613018716709785,0.11555546891557403,0.2550914394887657,0.17369010053548686,0.0,0.14293311301766695,

Whatever it is, it was never meant to be taken too seriously.  Two parts caught my attention early on - one is where the boy working at the movie theatre is about to leave, puts on a leather jacket ready to go on his motorcycle, while a poster for the Wild One with Marlon Brando is in the background.  Elsewhere in the theatre are posters for such movies as Forbidden Zone.  This film is campy and it knows it.The sense of humor is present throughout, perhaps the funniest are Robert Beltran's costume changes (Sant Claus and cowboy), and the kooky conclusion.  That the girls go the mall is pure homage to Dawn of the Dead.My only gripe about this film is that the premise is so good that more could have been done with it.  The girls celebrate their newfound freedom by going to a mall instead of mourning the loss of all their friends and family.  Instead of entirely letting the film run with that premise, there is a lot of time spent wondering what's going on and all too few glimpses of the zombie like creatures.  Still, there's enough in here to grant a few chuckles.",1.0,216,0.12767160867853025,0.0,0.108308586899009,0.0,0.0,0.16163015257037466,0.10438008254587511,0.0491563287568344,0.11645534092529977,0.05526487965396559,0.0,0.07507240215647229,0.0,0.045405506430632854,0.06085910653217013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18120000763758648,0.0,0.08813777085229113,0.0,0.0,0.05914359732836983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05177195261948346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06255518821619449,0.0,0.0,0.15839163837355733,0.0,0.3642141909793688,0.21254860996180233,0.0,0.0,0.05924613375999184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12812255293804767,0.0,0.04715243512658916,0.07742548538410014,0.0,0.12571616092291799,0.0,0.0,0.24705294712165501,0.1949439579869831,0.1040946704536484,0.07195923985822596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058306980046246126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17402660143619453,0.5518683529599426,0.14710753543961386,0.0,0.0,0.12400923177795926,0.0,0.10263495136600784,0.06616505438614072,0.21165648042540852,0.1573121237109906,0.08062848268762807,0.0,0.0,0.04723529312777292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063799414793276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13922420640590616,0.0,0.0,

478434,630580379X,A3CFNVFTZHONG9,4,4,980899200,There's Very Little Not to Like About This Movie,"Lately, after viewing all of Jackie's movies made over the past 10 or so years (the high budget movies like Police Story and Who Am I?), I have started to look at his earlier, less budgeted and clearly less known movies.However, my search lead me to a couple of decent movies, and then Rumble In Hong Kong (IMO, the only truly bad Jackie Chan movie).  After seeing that disaster, I was skeptical as to see this one, but I rented it anyhow and found loads of charm and excitement.  As I watched, I recognized a lot of actors used in some other movies like Police Story (Mars, Ti Pai), and a lot of faces that, although I never saw them before, I loved seeing them too.  Additionally, I find that martial arts movies differ than Anime in terms of dubbing.  I find that in martial arts movies, reading the subtitles and watching the action a bit tiring, and unlike Anime, the original voices aren't exactly better to listen to.  So, while many have problems with dubbing, trust me, the dubbing is not a problem.Every character has a large amount of likability, including Lord Sam Pao, the main villain.  Almost never do you see a movie that so successfully coasts on the charisma of the characters.  Yuen is a tough, but helpful and agreeable man, while Sammo Hung just can't help but be really cool, as well as funny.  Both support Chan, a rebellious yet charming character with a great sense of loyalty and justice.It's not just the characterizations of these characters that works, but remember that these three men are action stars, and while Chan hogs the spotlight, Sammo and Biao deliver some great moves and moments in action.  Going along with the awesome martial art sequences comes the infamous clock falling stunt, a stunt that Jackie broke his skull pulling off.  Another really awesome scene is when Jackie rides through the streets on a bike, and I had to watch Biao Yuen talk his way out of telling the pirate guard the password several times, for he pulled it off insanely well.  This movie never stops with its coolness; it's either adrenaline pumping, funny, or just plain likable.That all covers the movie itself, and know this here and now: the DVD version is better than the VHS version, mainly due to the superior look of widescreen mode, and superior sound quality from the DVD hardware.  This movie is nothing short of a work of art, one of Chan's best of all time, and all the DVD does is enhance it.  Well worth the price!",1.0,435,0.0,0.09938799802632646,0.13393325434225486,0.0,0.0,0.3597662504523945,0.03226882684038176,0.12157239366550793,0.036001861076365146,0.034169983169434204,0.0,0.0,0.047452657315713506,0.11229593913884738,0.0,0.03998747801621918,0.046851424101841295,0.0,0.13919982578729298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027247559077948083,0.03651131719026664,0.0,0.0,0.07552141792073432,0.044674482500387316,0.0386954604830101,0.064020649668765,0.03981428234495074,0.0,0.0,0.11603262733359315,0.0,0.0,0.12241589168590548,0.0,0.13511502625636615,0.10951473567777073,0.05047127552605269,0.11553008738471457,0.07326314310675254,0.0,0.04933503351324125,0.08992452989111843,0.0,0.0,0.1457705078489008,0.33510238044806734,0.0,0.03886481911983813,0.0,0.06314617061807896,0.3491463593603691,0.06026640974436753,0.0643611848917459,0.04449201790063833,0.08011450621098486,0.04587789583470274,0.03905784300789724,0.0,0.0,0.0868825133195052,0.08589231887526591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815269331891886,0.08074966444720481,0.08438851341563576,0.08943059475730293,0.24209938895224367,0.4549563834019613,0.0,0.09580508819179337,0.049148406019587296,0.0,0.0,0.08461153105386428,0.04090950362934332,0.15267709780561786,0.048632627567540415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02920533223423885,0.04635488337995345,0.04906244871299904,0.0,0.12489335149953135,0.0,0.0,0.040730752984181,0.0,0.0381798718125211,0.0,0.11477545521266165,0.0,0.031483684756141814,

379165,6303536069,AJIH1NJ9N28D9,1,1,1108339200,Get rid of the Charlie character.,"They really should make another CRITTERS movie.  With a proper budget, a good script and a dedicated director one solidly entertaining movie could reenergize the whole franchise and take it to a new level.  The most important change that needs to be made is you have to get rid of the goofy Charlie character.  He was in all four movies and sucked in all four movies.  Also make the movies much darker, without so much story and you've got a hit.As far a Part 3 goes some Krites invade a small apartment building and chase people all around but only kill two people.  It's entertaining, but at the same time disappointing.  The story goes nowhere, the direction is strictly by the numbers and of course you got the goofy dude showing up and slowing down the story.  There is a lot of wasted potential here.The one and only reason this movie is in my collection is because this is one of the earliest starring roles for Aimee Brooks, who is now legal and very sexy.  If you don't believe me just watch MONSTER MAN.",1.0,184,0.0,0.0,0.1875037654646889,0.0857602123125046,0.0,0.33577683639620687,0.0,0.05673293935546646,0.0672024738362568,0.06378301930165327,0.09061193993545405,0.0,0.0,0.10480798334131843,0.07023950094396413,0.0,0.0,0.09023211315218042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050861353310420056,0.0,0.08333410597721695,0.06825957522362815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05975171707400689,0.07431888762418477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696849155129331,0.13710375817595977,0.0,0.2942461223663284,0.08176978566145858,0.0,0.07188431785330368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392831212846447,0.0,0.08848750502505284,0.16326053898771395,0.2680779145606754,0.16670620270222233,0.07254658264781769,0.0,0.0,0.16293254278001107,0.0,0.18020863565567907,0.16610106141722789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18944796641747766,0.0,0.08108913891697866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06729400764096241,0.07536523182494988,0.2362843209493647,0.0,0.05021245928656169,0.4246196382369795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07156157105201623,0.07065074507580169,0.07896958701429206,0.07636327026188187,0.12213986043960484,0.0,0.09305598962177375,0.0770568825502542,0.07446934849400748,0.05451580881298097,0.08652782785079767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126803336944704,0.0,0.05356108195082304,0.0,0.23507468090115666,

The episodes are exciting and well edited and leave you wanting them to bring on the next episode.  I had not seen any of season 1, but I did see a few episodes of season 2 and hated the directors.  The writer/director in this first season was good.  The movie was good and the behind the scenes drama was a good time for anyone.I got these DVDs less than a week ago and someone has already borrowed one of the DVDs.  The show is addictive if you have not seen it. It is just a shame that the movie made in season 1 barely made over $100k.  Makes you wonder how Miramax can pony up the $1.5 mil for the season 1 movie and the 1.0 mil for the season two movie (which barely made 240k).  Season 3 is coming soon on Bravo, so I guess that are making profit somewhere.  I suppose DVD sells and the HBO deal made it profitable.Anyway, definitely think about getting the set slightly used and save a few bucks and enjoy Project Greenlight's best season in my opinion.",0.0,203,0.07686975500276648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3503370348966373,0.12569233607251087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924179143599413,0.054676371532024544,0.0,0.07787886975824279,0.0,0.0,0.09036766541817257,0.0,0.0,0.08744676875690474,0.15920052050800834,0.0,0.0,0.21365848916628843,0.0,0.08700719267049989,0.07536256039876423,0.06234271432883995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345045299007199,0.07270664331656516,0.19073193425359602,0.0,0.17543167768558376,0.12797331954265465,0.0,0.07500141773501537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22711994771468869,0.0,0.0,0.07569240013545915,0.0,0.12298230949454922,0.12749830632680464,0.11737374068389078,0.06267432436771095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364114276233064,0.0,0.0,0.10153394872865196,0.07021205916487916,0.0,0.0,0.08708668296961909,0.10477961666518856,0.5907097369209978,0.0,0.09329410550021851,0.0,0.07466467575305208,0.0,0.08239392347170142,0.0796745897236063,0.08495745171774181,0.0,0.09709115087675758,0.08039827893065303,0.0,0.1706392884587986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810799908507799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08759796740487646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08354266863796324,0.18395111967091027,

904558,B0009ETCVA,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,4,8,1114560000,Don't be fooled!,"Having enjoyed Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson's first collaboration in Scream, I was hoping for Cursed to be just as exciting, fun and scary. I've been watching the progress of Cursed (which was supposed to have been released almost 2 years ago but went through countless changes, casting decisions, etc) and so wasn't expecting too much when I went in. Overall, the movie was good but not Wes Craven great.But do not be fooled with this Unrated version!  I originally thought that maybe the theatrical cut was missing scenes or depth that would change my feelings about the movie.  However, I've read from a couple reliable sources that the unrated movie only adds about 1-2 minutes to the run time.  And those 1-2 minutes is probably a splash of blood here, a splash there.  I seriously doubt it will do much to change the film.  Therefore, if you are under the impression that the unrated version will be a million times better than the theatrical cut, I think you'll be disappointed.It was also pretty interesting to see a modern take on the classic werewolf legend and wolf man movies. So, in that aspect it was interesting. Was it scary? Not really. There were a couple of classic jump out moments but I think I jumped maybe twice. It also, of course, wasn't bloody at all, but really does 2 minutes more gore really change much?Also another problem, IMO, is that the movie keeps the standard horror movie cliches that Scream made fun of and twisted. Here you have characters doing stupid things, running upstairs when they shouldn't (or riding in an elevator, for instance), you have plenty of red herrings as to who is the ""master werewolf"" and you have the music cues (that seem ripped straight from Scream) to indicate that you should be scared right....now.All of this aside, it was an entertaining movie. MUCH better than some recent horror movies (Alone in the Dark and Boogeyman, I'm looking at you). It just didn't get over that last bar. It fell short of being a 4 or so rating. However, if you like horror movies, like Wes Craven and really want to see a horror movie in the theatre, then I would definitely recommend this one over the current crap fest. It should entertain you in the way that Scream did, only not as well.  And if you enjoyed the movie in the theatre, then you would definitely want to pick this version up over the PG-13 one.  But, with only about 2 minutes added to the running time, don't expect a huge difference.",0.5,435,0.11064593152030953,0.0,0.0625767133514339,0.12879562681271925,0.06786076784419062,0.1867679011595969,0.030153484096153413,0.08520215013681667,0.06728360784654158,0.15965006245222,0.0,0.08674813927227258,0.0,0.15740177811399725,0.0,0.0,0.08756027472118019,0.0451705255024451,0.0,0.0,0.034896897410937204,0.04195681030942364,0.05092275857315846,0.06823572655257354,0.041717357909137914,0.03417099273985537,0.03528535272534371,0.0,0.0,0.11964771146850137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465356988827035,0.18302571265209194,0.0,0.0631288645156783,0.1842041404975684,0.0,0.07197110428616978,0.06846046902886224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037012246667634634,0.0,0.21794352608366646,0.1342007834381819,0.16690746825083197,0.03631708431876954,0.0,0.11801340413667841,0.16312925236296258,0.028157860165602976,0.06014206759491507,0.12472619728094202,0.11229404933995125,0.0,0.03649745476630885,0.0,0.0,0.16237407678763588,0.08026175491282371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10106287824096165,0.03772811039463418,0.0,0.08356808352726502,0.27650194624287644,0.40741843926997484,0.0,0.0,0.09185308698042417,0.07164796783044251,0.035368021103871605,0.07906492754149667,0.07645546416489062,0.20381220122623778,0.04544457625205172,0.0,0.038574956928081924,0.0,0.21832650450023716,0.0,0.04584622100777485,0.0,0.038902041143142496,0.043321403750581376,0.0,0.07612139842629154,0.04202935516250593,0.03567703787890204,0.07875790764930006,0.05362574661457412,0.12025088921913853,0.32361792125459815,

I was browsing through my local video store, and since I usually like foreign film, I went to that section, and upon reading the captions about this film, and seeming to remember hearing of it before, I decided to rent it.  I was so happy I did.This film, while very &quot;heavy&quot;, is just so well done.  It beautifully intertwines three different stories, with a car crash being the one thing all the parties have in common.  One party was from the car that crashed, the second party was in the car that got hit by the first, and the third party came upon the crash, and rescued an injured dog in the back seat of the first car.  Dogs play a central role in each of the stories.What I liked especially about this film was the clever way in which we see the characters from each of the stories &quot;interact&quot;, even if only passing each other on the street.  I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who generally prefers &quot;non-Hollywood&quot; films.",1.0,181,0.11020473170520959,0.0,0.046745391885168935,0.0,0.050692630159242344,0.13951737417471446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05253291296802188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061799802488164676,0.3128197166679897,0.12536852353692765,0.0,0.10194545566353838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0623691614753477,0.0,0.0446889814214776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05211813228492836,0.17090240531920478,0.0,0.031438569322939126,0.09173481394025354,0.0,0.05376309003912038,0.051140612569792396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05425840532958272,0.06258354832554287,0.0,0.18278862266581244,0.042068371366734233,0.08985337733287023,0.062114426256306705,0.0,0.06404922303104349,0.0,0.0,0.623079540051041,0.0,0.059956283829108385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065989077833455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11266338960960236,0.4499018897296395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14765560638920402,0.0,0.12179970096919233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05569646353754686,0.2038649336388651,0.0,0.06849511432237572,0.06664470145169349,0.05812037932246219,0.0,0.05507095479579965,0.0,0.06279264514000778,0.05330216394028873,0.0,0.04005893576664806,0.0,0.0,

1578599,B008Y1YJYA,AXHCIHVT92GYF,7,7,1354579200,Moderately enjoyable melodrama,"Against the wishes of her upper class parents (Wilfrid Hyde White, Fay Compton), a girl (Maureen O'Hara) marries an impoverished painter (Dana Andrews) and moves to the slums. But the marriage is an unhappy one, due partly to the husband's alcoholism. But when he dies suspiciously, she becomes a victim of blackmail by the local hag (Dame Sybil Thorndike). Based on the novel by Margery Sharp (CLUNY BROWN), the first part of the film appears to be veering towards a dark noir-ish tale but with the appearance of a drunk ex-actor (also played by Dana Andrews), it turns into a soapy melodrama and becomes less interesting. As the painter, Andrews is dubbed by a British actor but as the ex-actor, he uses his own voice and an inadequate English accent. The most intriguing aspect of the second half of the film is that O'Hara and Andrews are living together without benefit of matrimony but passing themselves off as a married couple. Surely, quite daring for 1949. It's wonderful to see Dame Sybil in a decent film role which allows her to display her legendary acting talent, her Medusa harridan will make your skin crawl. Nimbly directed by Jean Negulesco (THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN). With Anthony Tancred and Diane Hart.The Fox MOD DVDr is a decent transfer is a little on the darkish side. A little clean up wouldn't hurt.",1.0,230,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07991220602890116,0.1894712350061705,0.1738223032070049,0.05612686144425151,0.15859292611865924,0.0,0.05943364226998189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24415276421324422,0.32724927559343475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19486835944783484,0.07809724645319417,0.04739310730529045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13850213518645055,0.334483890591242,0.0,0.06727387631804803,0.0,0.0,0.08516975005277919,0.08160215280212418,0.19584387111540014,0.0761938873810926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08245352409784557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26568874433294065,0.10482452449221384,0.05597339073830642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469850553421119,0.0,0.08890486602010939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046788461496619436,0.5605250468092815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18968519761091618,0.0,0.0,0.07180235808957872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084513300007268,0.07823227943659535,0.0,0.07329889567944359,0.09981748180352723,0.0,0.0,
573753,B000059PEX,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,3,3,1172361600,DE-LIGHTFUL,"This staged production of the 1927 George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber hit play, about a theatrical clan towering over Broadway from their Manhatten penthouse, is still a comedic gem, with knock-out performances from Rosemary Harris, as Broadway's leading lady who regards every doorway as a grand entrance, Ellis Rabb, who also co-directed, as her John Barrymore-ish brother, a tempermental actor who remains just this side of frantic measures, and Keene Curtis, a leading man past his prime, grasping at roles with shoe polish adorning his graying hair. The biting 1920's theatrical sarcasm is still very funny, and serves as historical document of what was relevant at a time when emerging radio, silent movies, and sensational staged productions were Broadways's only competition. The foreign collection of exotic people and animals accompanying brother Tony, (Rabb), on his return trip from Europe, gives the production an authentic 1920's global glitz. I would have preferred to see this play filmed before a live audience, which would have comforted the sometimes hollowness of a filmed staged play, but ""The Royal Family"", is a real treat for lovers of theatre, and historical Broadway.",1.0,188,0.09811253620896515,0.0,0.0,0.11420632847128051,0.09026077982441533,0.29810124949143546,0.0,0.3022035758755651,0.1789862126987086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06978606191105367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06773174023283901,0.2722785234907171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15914196205603487,0.0,0.11950670296662724,0.0,0.2884328739543222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.167933865814717,0.0,0.0,0.09572788820499802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11899921708312693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254643440874803,0.07490485290616235,0.0,0.11059786273918949,0.0,0.0,0.09708963907915392,0.12614332507742537,0.0,0.0,0.10675518150842361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28273163377405663,0.11304857475221788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15774494402366204,0.10169248059799899,0.05421762471844985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09917035704340008,0.0725983553478799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11524254174647008,0.09805660724111645,0.10124814383264136,0.11180546560260773,0.28472155825014694,0.0,0.1426539033337014,0.21325898856945122,0.0,

357765,6303115381,A2VGS4F6A5UNE8,0,0,1172275200,NOT AS FUNNY AS THE Original SHOW,"TITLE: RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND was shown on TV on October 14 1978 and it will take you 95 minutes to watch this movie. Rescue From Gilligan's Island is a two-part television movie that continues the adventures of the shipwrecked castaways from the 1964-1967 TV series Gilligan's Island starring Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., and Jim Backus. The film first aired on NBC October 14 and October 21, 1978. It was directed by Leslie Martinson. It has fallen in the public domain.SUMMARY: The movie begins when a satellite belonging to the U.S.S.R. experiences technical problems and is almost about to break apart. The scientists on the satellite dispose of a disc containing important information. Seconds later, the satellite blows up. The movie then picks up 15 years after the shipwreck of the S. S. Minnow stranded the crew and passengers on Gilligan's Island. After 15 years, little of their original possessions are left. Even their radio has finally broken down due to age. The metal recording disk from the Soviet satellite is lost and lands in the lagoon. Gilligan finds it and shows it to the professor. Realizing that the unique alloy can be used to make a barometer, the professor quickly realizes that a tidal wave is on the way, which will destroy the island. Quickly the castaways make plans to reinforce one of the huts to take shelter. When the castaways awaken the next morning, they realize that the hut has been swept off the island and is now a makeshift raft. They use clothes and make a sail, and try to make their way to land. In an attempt to make a meal, Gilligan makes a fire, which spreads to the raft. At first, angry with Gilligan for doing another one of his stupid stunts, the castaways are then grateful when the United States Coast Guard spots the smoke and rescues them. After being towed to Hawaii, the castaways are at first confused by modern life. They are informed that the President is now Jimmy Carter, and that they had missed the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. They quickly part however, to try to return to life, as they knew it before the shipwreck. However, they agree to go on a cruise for the holidays. At this time, the Soviets discover that Gilligan is still in possession of the recording disk from their satellite. Determined to recover it, they send two spies to try to get it from Gilligan, by any means necessary. The Skipper and Gilligan are next seen hard at work, refurbishing the S. S. Minnow II. However, the insurance company informs them that they will not be able to get a settlement unless their former passengers sign a statement testifying that the Skipper was not responsible for the shipwreck.QUESTIONS: Who did the skipper find first? Who did the Skipper go to see next? Who was the next person that the Skipper had to find? Who was the final person that the Skipper had to find? Why did the Skipper have to find these people?MY THOUGHTS: I didn't think that this was as good as the regular show. The movie definitely misses the talent of Tina Louise. She played the role of Ginger far better and she was a lot better to look at also. The comedy part of this movie wasn't that funny either. Therefore, with that in mind I give this picture only 6 star because it wasn't as funny as the original show.",0.0,583,0.024598091764887024,0.09291091731541966,0.0,0.028633015274256955,0.022629554088403583,0.1868446728000233,0.10055292932647472,0.0947079697750298,0.11218544170633002,0.042590849921116,0.030252875899464272,0.028927932472522302,0.0,0.0,0.0703532086437523,0.024921005469446308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02758787556821224,0.023274161273607766,0.11193081816627541,0.05094369056246938,0.1365275502035307,0.05564600797902375,0.02279002590234325,0.0,0.083526124524677,0.07234738199408575,0.01994948218421865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02410462711386657,0.0,0.0,0.07629206085500574,0.0,0.09824082157592211,0.12285323886309273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090165562903354,0.0,0.0,0.024221341727569748,0.0,0.039353971328460545,0.14959661497814067,0.13145736127418026,0.04011119281032613,0.027728325877385423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031625775927082336,0.0,0.0,0.026764915601900658,0.03327729433388546,0.06371027689534461,0.0649811200253944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23470414833624298,0.6734028080487462,0.14171375662545807,0.05970766963247993,0.06126056235564068,0.0,0.21229535556295384,0.06591452289502711,0.025495630489266674,0.353419696915307,0.0,0.062137755967584994,0.05145441774346783,0.0,0.12740947824613405,0.02888930134025469,0.06115342168991749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07615268841023659,0.05606217531368966,0.0951778748213799,0.07879028138016732,0.03576519311811521,0.0,0.019621269430592565,
321139,6302571839,A3UA046AA3DXFD,1,1,1341446400,Kickboxer 3: The Art of Cody Lambert,"When one was pondering how to re-place Van Damme in the Kickboxer series there was only one person who could hold that jock...and that man is non other then Sasha Mitchell best known as dude extraordinaire Cody Lambert from Step By Step. Well being a product of the 90's, maybe we just know he best for that role, but that's nothing to scoff at. Our only hope would be that he roundhouse kicked that nerdy kid with the huge red specks at least once during the filming of that series. Whats so great about Sasha is the fact that not only is he a 90's tv icon, but he's an actual black belt and amateur kickboxing champion. Good work on that lead Southern Sid. So all this martial arts/kickboxing experience only made him 100x more incredible in his role as David Sloan. It's not that fruity Dutch wang chung stuff either, this is real roundhouse kicking 90's action. We certainly wouldn't have it any other way and nor should you. On top his great arse whooping skills, he had the same ""Dude"" voice that we all loved in Step by Step. This leads us to believe that it's not an act but actually his legitimate speaking voice. This makes him an even less assuming yet more lethal kickboxing machine.We open Kickboxer 3 with a very attractive lady running for her life as she's chased by a machete yielding Brazilian nutbar. The scene is tense yet we must applaud the director for the slow motion running rack action. Not the most opportune time for that, but whose complaining? Once captured she's returned to home of our villain Lane, whose running a brothel against the girls will. He captures them then forces them to a life of Merry Xmiss re-enactments with the clients. Now enter David Sloan, well known kickboxing champ, showing up in Rio for a fight and some R&R; with his trainer who looks like a Mr. Miyagi stunt double. David and Miyagi's brother happen to befriend a young boy and his sister after they try to steal their camera. Naturally they all become a big team of good time buddies. Lance approaches David about throwing the fight but he's like no way! No banya! Out of spite he decides to kidnap the young girl and get her ready for the pink negligee scene. Once David discover this he goes straight to Lane's house. He's met by a gang of guards in which he kicks, punches, or shoots to death only to be captured and forced to complete strenuous tasks. This is meant to tire him out so he looses the fight. Obviously it has no effect, the girl gets saved, and Lane gets wang chunged to death.As dumb as Kickboxer 3 was it was equally awesome in every sense of the imagination. The story line is so absurd down to the villains' name being Lane. Seriously, could their be a more pathetic name for a dangerous lunatic? It doesn't help the guy looks like his idol is Don Johnson. Glen Ghoulia would have been a tougher choice. Amongst all the killing and fighting their is a large amount of horrendous dialogue, which tries so hard to be charmingly funny. Every time Cody and Miyagi's brother kill someone the make some half whited joke that makes the viewer feel embarrassed. The fight scenes however are a thing of beauty. When our heroes embark on their revenge mission there are countless gun fights that will leave you speechless. Two guys get launched through huge second story windows, and even Cody launches himself through one. That's always a huge factor in a good B. Also the DMF was very strong even in Rio. In fact in Rio they are a few years behind because most people were still sporting fine curly mullets. So yes we fully recommend the viewing and purchase of Kickboxer 3. We're also excited to see Cody's getting some work as he'll be in an upcoming film called Cyborg: Rise of the Slingers.

871933,B0006Q93CE,A6NA5T5XTW1CY,0,0,1337040000,Do You Wanna Get Rocked?,"This is overall a very accurate, gripping dramatization of the first nine years of Def Leppard's existence. Casting is absolutely superb; everyone really looks like who they're supposed to. There are certain distance shots of the group onstage where I honestly forgot it wasn't the real band. The actors did a fantastic job mimicking the mannerisms and attitudes, and the costume designer deserves a medal for duplicating real outfits any Def Lep fan will recognize. One thing in this movie that really stood out to me is how well they portrayed Steve Clark's alcoholism. I knew he had a terrible problem with it, but to see it so realistically acted out is enough to bring you to tears. Certain events have been fictionalized/tweaked, but it gets the general point across (e.g. in tweaking: Rick Allen didn't drum completely by himself for the first couple of shows after his accident; there was a backup drummer briefly. E.g. in fictionalizing: again with Rick, they show him using drugs just before his accident. I may be misinformed but I have never ever heard that drugs were involved with the wreck).I feel obligated to offer a few words of caution, however. The case simply states it's rated R for drug use, but there's more than that. There is some language (f word used twice, some ""white trash-talk,"" and some crude comments). If that sort of thing bothers you, all you need is a good memory and a mute button handy. One scene involves some groupies and the guys at a hotel; thankfully, it is right at the end of a scene segment [in other words, if you press the scene skip button right as ""Photograph"" is finishing, the DVD will skip the nasty scene entirely and take you to the next part without leaving anything else out. I promise, you're not missing anything if you do that). My other caution is they do show Rick's arm lying on the ground after the accident. You might want to have your younger Def Lep fans close their eyes.Those detractors aside, this is a great movie that I have watched multiple times already and will continue to do so for many years. It's a real treat to get to see the story of one of rock's greatest bands lovingly represented on the big screen. The determination and friendship really shows through, making one appreciate all over again just what a close-knit unit this was.",0.0,407,0.0,0.11075879344942302,0.07462815404418074,0.0,0.0,0.1781895270845488,0.0359606431142956,0.033870316100901826,0.08024153366477332,0.03807930719191196,0.0,0.05172733716694039,0.0,0.12514350802190413,0.04193391223457607,0.0,0.15663482436378118,0.0,0.05170847271547667,0.0,0.0,0.10007426517878602,0.12145960590195218,0.0,0.049751564849291136,0.04075187035968028,0.04208084122126339,0.04978560669276771,0.0,0.1426902655043389,0.04436936010536524,0.0,0.057525477409237316,0.08620513582757486,0.0534724469900308,0.1248084521638801,0.10913701236702371,0.0,0.2509554738704997,0.1708617571665457,0.0,0.08583177942302399,0.04082252131020337,0.0,0.05497936265167589,0.050106313790567604,0.04414031191317209,0.0,0.06497913587343705,0.0,0.0,0.043311270564108814,0.0,0.03518530309241778,0.2188639928937444,0.06716137724241691,0.1434492559493301,0.0,0.0,0.10225340060283739,0.13057913386521136,0.0,0.0,0.1452338693537145,0.09571909882597304,0.0,0.0,0.11619566342087487,0.08035082745192834,0.17997616579919656,0.04702162289470022,0.049831091125104546,0.17986501890023832,0.44363120760135255,0.05068094843709816,0.0,0.0,0.17089282238822628,0.16871772170930638,0.09429177845952814,0.0,0.2673700852608198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044459187237179815,0.06509331961183078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04639405560913772,0.05166452853399107,0.04395988066542442,0.0,0.0,0.042547959713287876,0.14088844594411684,0.09593002567771336,0.0,0.2806853951124825,

953443,B000BYRCQU,A39IY0JU5JI69G,10,13,1167264000,Perfect!,"This is a perfect film.  The script is so smart.  I loved the idea that the well-educated, cosmopolitan Madeleine runs a gallery that features ""outsider art.""  A psychologist would say that she's looking for her own dark side.  She's so polished and perfect that it's almost painful to look at her. No extra body fat on those bones. No wonder she is attracted to the art of those who are demented (one is autistic), delusional, etc.  No wonder she falls in love with the sweet southern boy who comes from a mayonnaise eating, cigarette smoking family.  His mother has hips big enough for all of them!For his part, the male lead,(sorry I can't remember his name, but he's great!) for all of his sermonizing on the importance of family, has obviously left this life behind for the Big City and the Big City lady!  It's perfect.  Opposites attract and then they have to deal with what their attracted to.Madeline loves the crazed primitive artist, but she sees him as a commodity.  When she's faced with the real deal---the culture that spawned this art, she can't quite fathom it. She chooses the representation of the culture over the actual values, when she goes to close the deal with the artist instead of being with the family in the hospital.  But this is her culture and the movie doesn't come down too hard on her for her decision.  It seems to just show it like it is.The film makers are to be strongly commended for not presenting us with another patronizing picture of Southern Christians!!!!!  The scene where the male lead sings a hymn is gorgeous!Indeed much of the beauty of the film is the deep respect with which each character is presented.  That's what saves it and that's what brings us to a hopeful feeling at the end.  Yes, the male lead sees the fault of his wife but he sees beyond it, too, and they drive off happilly into the sunset together.  His mother loves him and he's able to pass that love on to the woman of his choice.All the actors were first rate.  I especially loved the father....before he uttered a word, his face and posture spoke volumes!Everything in this film is done with just the right tone.  It's definitely a movie worth seeing.",0.7692307692307693,386,0.0,0.0,0.0853417954988157,0.0,0.0,0.13584698139058454,0.05483088592095789,0.025821832945710783,0.0611740224516014,0.02903065640334467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09540609980595326,0.0,0.06794634512805815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12691255145395014,0.03814698613844012,0.16204578300481218,0.03101984273531362,0.0,0.0,0.03208132008551026,0.0,0.06575096113341565,0.027195820876425573,0.1353041053571178,0.20422538753595465,0.08771180424525385,0.26288205988637664,0.0,0.0,0.0624023782315739,0.039858974972634104,0.19132181417471894,0.16747776445307538,0.0,0.06543587792602294,0.03112201027455788,0.07729378918208184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049538374146908516,0.0,0.03793792253755148,0.0,0.11425708861119388,0.02682434423965775,0.20393525541647844,0.102404114469506,0.02734047943540956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39083419213344756,0.044292249900053045,0.06125734514352767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828324427002874,0.5475824606363603,0.038637814308384505,0.04069777534271668,0.041756253752065896,0.0,0.06431296377601023,0.08985694672447558,0.0,0.18530534513192035,0.08263610162781776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03536960062741408,0.039387669753342056,0.10054155014151878,0.06920931093644687,0.03821294366677787,0.06487487773213306,0.0,0.19502536991571057,0.036443896873537066,0.0,

Well worth the wait for all of you LOTR fans.  I admit I am not a fanatic of the series ( have not read all the books, couldn't spot a hobbitt without his shoes off, etc), but I loved this movie.  it is well directed and just a stunning film.  Years from now, the debate about last year's Oscar selection might be why was A Beautiful Mind picked over this classic.  The print and the sound are great on this collection.  The movie is better now than the original version (which was pretty good already).  Even though this is a long film, it moves along very well.  I have always been a sucker for the underdog movie (Star Wars, Seven Samurai, Magnificent Seven, Dirty Dozen) and this may turn out to be the best of the bunch (well maybe second best behind Seven Samurai).  This is a perfect gift for those DVD lovers on your gift lists.  Even if they bought the 2 disc set that came out earlier in the year, get him or her this one.  They will thank you for it.  The extras are amazing.  Four commentaries, a ton of shorts, some history on the author- it may be the best packaged disc to come out yet. This is the rare movie that gets better after each viewing. It is also a disc set that you can enjoy at your own pace and relish the hours of extras.  Buy this set, you will not regret it!",0.0,273,0.05553245398878349,0.06991831304355256,0.09422050338073042,0.06464166482814616,0.051088299174280725,0.112485074527913,0.09080299357579866,0.0,0.10130758010523648,0.14422913997929102,0.0,0.06530746752128636,0.2002943905602953,0.03949945054809282,0.0,0.05626146136920085,0.0,0.0,0.06528365052975443,0.12456433167933316,0.15763067750228218,0.0,0.15334675438618103,0.05137058308117448,0.06281298987114353,0.05145057904986124,0.15938534565137868,0.0,0.0,0.0900755808283136,0.0,0.06764171776897787,0.07262781061831469,0.054418412164327745,0.0,0.052524927710654715,0.034447268508753244,0.0,0.25347164353260043,0.1849016555090775,0.0,0.0541827247831527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640766000353058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13326781339152044,0.1842153348735478,0.12719017747197825,0.04527735302529248,0.0,0.056359633314130395,0.0,0.16486045891630038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512655185332777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05680645982511872,0.0,0.06291339441464461,0.11354275633919765,0.5067562531722584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10650584134299919,0.32737781201340055,0.0,0.06137518947926918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056131188758940895,0.08218246074957963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23429609531966777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06328275788373708,0.0,0.11858420339616786,0.0,0.0,0.17718727977286414,

853908,B00030590I,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,3,7,1130544000,"""Is the sword the only answer?""","In 2002, Yimou Zhang directed the Chinese martial-arts film entitled ""Hero"", or ""Ying Xiong"" in transliterated Mandarin Chinese.  Released theatrically in the U.S. in 2004, the film's story centers around three assassins, a warrior and a king who are experts with martial arts in pre-unified China.  Each of the assassins are from the kingdom of Zhao and want to kill the king (Daoming Chen) of the neighboring kingdom known as Qin. As the film begins, the king of Qin has requested a visit from a nameless warrior (Jet Li) who claims to have defeated the assassins.  The nameless warrior enters a great empty hall and is told to sit about 50 paces from the king to tell his story.  The king sits on a raised platform. In front of the platform and separating him from the rest of the great hall are a hundred or more flickering oil-filled lamps shaped like small soldiers.  As the nameless soldier begins to tell his story about how he defeated the assassins, the film flashes back to a Zhao village with a massive Qin army approaching.  Inside the Zhao village is a school of calligraphy in which the assassins have come to live: Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Ziyi Zhang, who played the pivotal character of Jen Yu in the 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").  In this first version of the story with all of the Zhao people wearing red, the Qin army opens fire with a massive number of arrows shot from very long bows.  The arrows begin to destroy the village and the calligraphy school.  The assassins escape the onslaught, but are encountered by the nameless warrior who successfully defeats them.  Returning to the king of Qin's great hall, the king is suspicious of the nameless warrior's story and proceeds to tell what he believes really happened.  In this second version of the nameless warrior's battle with the three assassins, they all wear blue and a beautiful battle scene unfolds over a lake with floating choreography reminiscent of the 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  Returning again to the king of Qin's great hall, the king becomes suspicious of the warrior's true intensions as the flickering oil lamps blow in a particular direction to warn the king.  It is here the final and more honest telling of the story begins with the three assassins and the nameless warrior all wearing white.  Here, Broken Sword explains why several years earlier he did not kill the king of Qin when he and Flying Snow had the opportunity to do so.  During this explanation the film flashes back several more years to the king of Qin's great hall, which is filled with green drapes.  With Broken Sword and Flying Snow each wearing green and taking on the king's massive army, Broken Sword engages in a personal battle with the king; but makes a surprising choice.  Here, at last, the full meaning of the story becomes clear as time shifts back to the present for a highly emotional ending.With a combination of exquisite uses of color, beautiful cinematography, superb martial arts choreography and a complex story, ""Hero"" is a wonderful film to watch.  If you enjoyed films such as the 2000 ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or the 2004 ""The House of Flying Daggers"" (in which Ziyi Zhang also starred), you will probably enjoy ""Hero"".  What is important to remember with ""Hero"" is the historical context for the film: the first emperor of China was the king of the kingdom of Qin, who successfully and brutally conquered the other former Chinese kingdoms to unify China. Other memorable characters in the film include Sky (Donnie Yen), the scholar (Liu Zhong Yuan), the old servant (Zheng Tia Yong), the general (Chang Xiao Yang) and the commander (Zhang Ya Kun).

676121,B00005QW5Y,A22P0C6YIULM0P,1,2,1074902400,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful retelling of the Arthurian legend, with a welcome twist of change which makes Morgan le Fay (Morgaine) the heroine instead of the villainess we're accustomed to seeing in ""Excalibur.""  The movie begins with three sisters:  Viviane (the Lady of the Lake and High Priestess of Avalon), Igraine (mother of Morgaine and Arthur) and Morgause.  Upon learning of her destiny with the future High King, Uther Pendragon, Igraine is reluctant to accept but very quickly falls in love with Uther, and he with her.  Their secret tryst on the night of her husband Gorlois's death at war, results in the conception of Arthur.  When Morgaine and Arthur are both old enough, they are taken from Uther and Igraine and to their separate futures.  Morgaine is groomed by Viviane to become the next high priestess of Avalon, a magical land which is fading away as people stop believing in it and in the Goddess.  One of the other priestesses is Raven, a kind soul who has taken a vow of silence.  Morgaine grows into a beautiful woman in the form of Julianna Marguilies, and is chosen to take part in the Great Marriage at Beltane.  She doesn't realize until after she realizes she is pregnant with the Beltane child and after her reunion with Arthur that he was the man she slept with in the Great Marriage.  Yuk!  Anyway, lots of twists and turns in the saga of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, the coming of age of Mordred by his evil aunt Morgause, and the slow fading of Avalon of the years passing by and the deaths of Merlin and Viviane.  We all know how it ends.  I screamed right along with Raven when Viviane died.While this is a great film which I would gladly recommend to anyone with an interest in the legend of Avalon, there are a few roles which I believe was miscast.  Even though they did a great job anyway, I think that Michael Vartan, Edward Atterton, and Hans Matheson were all miscast for their roles as Lancelot, Arthur, and Mordred.  I really believe that they could have found better actors for those roles, but the final selections are well enough.  Joan Allen really sinks her teeth into her role of Morgause-  wonderfully wicked!",0.5,380,0.0,0.09478774106650181,0.06386702059047812,0.0,0.034630015105221776,0.32405226921103475,0.1231009483561863,0.05797265666096102,0.06867096940044487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0535491136419369,0.10766154156269699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04221773632462971,0.035616457722400637,0.0,0.05197276584423451,0.034821360210024424,0.0,0.0,0.14405169133096832,0.0,0.036904408596106865,0.030528700065498335,0.07594288969704635,0.27510413295521474,0.0,0.036887319909087314,0.04576189665516519,0.0,0.23349953865606454,0.0894874765786209,0.17181481838601304,0.041778301664316585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04338311606014255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02780467949350199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4578555119685544,0.0287384641772523,0.03069108669759141,0.0,0.0,0.04375439889536609,0.0,0.04839693675760282,0.0,0.08286108322208799,0.0,0.0,0.19499172123539532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696453846900432,0.4338983451003231,0.1301187689351472,0.0,0.0,0.03656266038609338,0.1082918874022491,0.040347607638950254,0.0,0.12480883723505937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03804831920446381,0.05570707780726011,0.0,0.0,0.09105493286520115,0.03970418594449523,0.04421467407225851,0.0,0.07769099174903454,0.1715839358000911,0.03641268438024946,0.0,0.27365744218446464,0.04091013843360759,0.0,
1415762,B004LWZW4M,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,2,3,1312588800,From throwing poop to throwing spears,"Now this is a summer movie that has it all. A smart story, great CGI and a likeable cast. The first 90 minutes is an engaging build up with more depth that your average blockbuster, followed by plenty of chaotic action to close out the final half hour. I've seen the first two of the old Planet of the Apes films and the remake by Tim Burton. Other than the originality of the first 1968 film, this prequel, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is my favorite.James Franco plays a scientist who stumbles upon a cure for Alzheimer's by increasing brain function. He tests it out on a chimpanzee who gives birth to her genetically enhanced offspring named Caesar, thus creating the future leader of the apes. Andy Serkis, who famously played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong, shows you why he is the best in the business at bringing motion capture characters to life. All of the movements and facial expressions of Caesar are his. In fact, Serkis ends up being more of the lead actor than Franco. It was also nice to see John Lithgow on the big screen, especially after his phenomenal work on Dexter, even though his role is rather small.The other stars of the show are the incredible SFX by WETA. Most of the ape scenes provide the illusion that you are watching real animals rather than something made in a computer. A few parts don't quite look as convincing, but as a whole I can see this receiving an Oscar nomination for visual effects.Other than some moments you have to suspend disbelief as far as the story is concerned, Rise of the Planet of the Apes will not insult your intelligence, or in my case lack thereof, and it provides a nice launching point for the lengthy series that has come before it.",0.6666666666666666,319,0.0,0.05753322838806272,0.07753061399615208,0.053191267123760815,0.0840773942163243,0.11569982886728572,0.11207770483096545,0.14075044128745617,0.041681155407781986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05493831499135851,0.03250265646670908,0.17425927276093206,0.04629550350255323,0.0,0.055964885165276375,0.0,0.051249721507506604,0.04323617745208242,0.15594957406956048,0.0946375862626938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04371746158196097,0.0,0.08959934035337214,0.03705995424084859,0.09218997242110079,0.05565990121271023,0.0,0.13433677670179608,0.0,0.0,0.17007240136567708,0.0,0.15642942445037453,0.12679068750209715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09171405961840891,0.05488282258154375,0.03375316169702179,0.0,0.0,0.0899914902839719,0.0,0.036553740171315074,0.37896019199080955,0.10466015569705375,0.0,0.0,0.046376285613606356,0.15934540456218088,0.09043843710477877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09944183395910658,0.06181889804882409,0.0,0.060357389540798424,0.0,0.046743962844184264,0.09770080315703328,0.20707654586982607,0.12457358781342624,0.6145133893717918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346925137423803,0.0,0.1262585093933783,0.0,0.057716345003916945,0.09558635905702392,0.0,0.03381247399986128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13260824214820488,0.04878930683695422,0.03322032141317898,0.0,0.10935071003803132,

286837,6301977688,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,0,0,1340150400,Pride and Prejudice Receives the Full MGM Treatment,"Yes, it lacks the passionate intensity of the Colin Firth version, and the romance and lush locales of the Keira Knightly movie. But as a comedy of manners, this version is razor-sharp in the best MGM tradition. Co-scripted by Aldous Huxley, every other line is a barb or a zinger, delivered with staccato aplomb by a talented cast. Even director Robert Z. Leonard puts those wrong-era dresses to work by choreographing the women's movements as a gaggle of Bennets march down the street or several of them float from room to room. The movie also boasts three of MGM's finest character actors: Mary Boland as the fluttery Mrs. Bennet, solely obsessed with getting her daughters married (compare this role with Boland's work as the amorous countess in ""The Women""), Edmund Gwenn as the wise, ever-sensible Mr. Bennet, and, of course, Edna May Oliver as the haughty Lady Catherine, whose every sneer speaks volumes. (Austen purists will doubtless be unhappy with her character's benevolent turnabout at the end.) Modern audiences may not be able to appreciate the exquisite black-and-white cinematography and lighting, the Oscar-winning set designs, or the movie's high comic style, but then, nowadays, the 1940's MGM backlot is just as alien a place to many as is Jane Austen's 1813 England. In the leads, Greer Garson brings intelligence and regal beauty, if not girlishness, to Elizabeth. Laurence Olivier captures the arrogance and intensity of Darcy, even if the script has him cave in a bit too quickly to Elizabeth's charms. And Maureen O'Sullivan captures Jane's sweetness and loveliness as no other actress has done since.",0.0,266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814521675649761,0.0,0.26680886953324634,0.0,0.40572084779494044,0.05339920486037373,0.10136420044895977,0.0,0.0,0.07038342167356453,0.08328060938771888,0.16743729595443438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313156677660379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054154847779385354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11478888922524406,0.0,0.0,0.1426157426917566,0.07656420839860431,0.0,0.0,0.11074351483606687,0.14525718577570768,0.0,0.13360485173205056,0.03248720833227208,0.0,0.05711940641723545,0.0,0.0,0.07317542711969585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297271137408111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649050732088213,0.09366058309681567,0.25893297474526533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17824290751415736,0.1360953620171861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5904561554400977,0.0,0.07105070929761312,0.07289861476977132,0.0,0.0,0.06274937385474937,0.0,0.19410509931892123,0.07213359434027194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06250570948174176,0.17023892272800145,0.0,0.0,

I haven't seen a Disney animation since Pocahontas, and don't particularly care to see one ever again, apart from the old classics, like Cinderella, Snow White and Peter Pan. (Just don't sit me down in front of Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty or any of the Fantasia stuff).The characters are all like previous characters in previous Disney animations. Kuzco was a longer haired version of Aladdin, the male characters apart from Kuzco all had the square jaws reminiscent of the guys in Pocahontas, and Yzma is a mixture of Snow White's evil stepmother and Cruella De Ville. And some of the landscapes look very familiar.I did like the ending, but the rest of the movie didn't really do it for me. And I nearly died when it started, you know a film's gonna be bad, when Tom Jones does the title track! Considering the makers of the film originally wanted to get Sting to sing the opening song but he said he was too old, they need someone more hip and younger. So they went with Tom Jones. Sting is in his 50's, Tom is in his 60's.This is also the first Disney animation to show a pregnant woman, that being Pacha's wife. Never mind falling slightly behind the times, there's also all the hooha about Kuzco and Pacha being slightly more friendly than kids will understand!Like many other Disney films, this one contains a number of hidden Mickey Mouse images. One is in the bushes when Kuzco gets pulled from the water and another is Yzma's head and earrings (upside down).In the scene where Yzma is searching through the various potions she says, ""Lions, tigers and bears...oh my!"" a line from The Wizard of Oz. According to producer Randy Fullmer and director Mark Dindal, they were forced to use this joke, which they detested, by then-head of Feature Animation Thomas Schumacher.There's one great line I really did like, you'll probably have to see the film to enjoy it (not that I'm condoning that you understand): ""Who's in my chair..?"" ""Ooh, ooh, I know! I know! Yzma's in your chair!""There's loads of extras on this DVD, if you can actually have the time to watch them all. Frankly, they all look frightfully tedious, but if you're into that kinda thing, then goody for you.I really can't recommend this DVD, but I'm still giving it a semi good score. If you wanna see it, go knock yourself out. Kronk by far overshadows Kuzco. And the ending's funny. That's about it.",0.2857142857142857,430,0.07841786207245025,0.0,0.1663119920830282,0.09128105805752756,0.0,0.2581168747674345,0.03205592457444248,0.0,0.0,0.033944537513170815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155503647087307,0.07476119508933272,0.11917094961809903,0.04654230922750438,0.09604083918640935,0.09218761165970353,0.0,0.11129582648425326,0.04460394501591436,0.05413557195375473,0.1450816958117695,0.04434938510972735,0.03632690545509333,0.037511572524732154,0.04437973058390009,0.0,0.06359825620993842,0.07910319381292999,0.0,0.0,0.07684471390668116,0.0,0.11125636202061627,0.2188947958354146,0.046605714056098105,0.1565941632761495,0.13055061929738593,0.0,0.03825594885121587,0.18194942452770468,0.0,0.049009532357679714,0.08933122861394326,0.0786948389595688,0.0,0.028961749541727422,0.0,0.0,0.07721679604080345,0.0,0.03136477338501947,0.2601320792461626,0.02993439294669808,0.12787308932035196,0.0,0.039792964602050764,0.04557520407500384,0.03880014838143268,0.0,0.0,0.12946392384752264,0.17065124239000146,0.0,0.050776537403080274,0.0517893883412801,0.035813042276614894,0.040108448406494863,0.0,0.044420276175024996,0.13361226283600192,0.4896175767941355,0.0,0.04758649417462995,0.09764827237824218,0.11425256093263872,0.1879972830399436,0.12607992557370654,0.04063959217380076,0.21667109940017898,0.048311760724164717,0.0,0.0,0.03963167032876266,0.08703792659428629,0.046049044566607036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04605463324434736,0.0,0.12138606265232055,0.04468106686131221,0.03792796983720712,0.04186344667827179,0.028504548317589654,0.0,0.2189317387342386,

This DVD contains over an hours worth of the trailers/coming attractions that you've probably seen at one of those movie theatres that has featured these films.It starts off with an intro that features quick clips from fight scenes of Bruce Lee's and other kung fu films put together in music video style set to the song ""Kung Fu Fighting"". Then after a shortened look back at Bruce Lee's career , life , and some of his movie trailers (including a commercial for ""The Green Hornet"" tv show) we go into the long row of 1970 kung fu trailers that make up just about the majority of this DVD. Features trailers of some of the Bruce Lee exploitation films like ""Bruce Lee Fights Back From The Grave"" and ""Bruce Lee:His Last Days"" (entertaining but oh so inaccurate that its shameful) to trailers of kung fu classics like ""Five Deadly Venoms"" , ""Flying Guillotine"" , ""The Deadly Angels"" , ""10 Tigers of Kwangtung"" , ""5 Masters of Death"" , ""The Kid with The Golden Arm"" , ""Deep Thrust"" ,""When Tae Kwon Do Strikes"" and ""The Executioners of Death"".Some of these trailers might make you laugh because of the cheesey 70's retro style and low-budget quality in which they were made while some trailers actually have very nice film artistry and fight choreography to them.The whole production looks as if it was quickly pieced together but if you liked these films then you won't mind the level of quality on the DVD but its the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",1.0,288,0.05460712394412711,0.06875327330401651,0.0,0.0,0.10047404300440525,0.1935688131797467,0.04464497756296648,0.042049845926537856,0.09961950509883134,0.0,0.06716059764711302,0.0,0.0,0.11652382905176244,0.0,0.0,0.06482047792336121,0.0,0.19258751270329777,0.0,0.05166803268771121,0.0,0.037697889349924824,0.15154380524741648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0535364354458262,0.044287331581136846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702329050685401,0.0,0.1549491350534249,0.06774655632448928,0.06490878319571038,0.0,0.09091033165847381,0.13965732157421462,0.05327988510037322,0.10136195518890681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067130651446283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.513246373132754,0.04169027470609467,0.04452290239169939,0.0,0.0,0.0634735697181666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07212819817836812,0.04987759642333915,0.22343960474888344,0.0,0.0,0.1860846803091853,0.4720852797712519,0.0,0.06627473682104952,0.20399528264728967,0.0,0.05236557419347443,0.05853141058014556,0.0,0.09052875404170908,0.0,0.0,0.057113734554021536,0.055195882074827535,0.04040653255744917,0.0,0.0,0.06604572083396196,0.0,0.0641412810630279,0.0,0.05635232920292859,0.06222828553518276,0.0,0.058304125133548525,0.079397798502177,0.0,0.2613522468276071,
627218,B00005JN5E,A33TBHM3O9AY17,1,1,1119830400,"Enjoyable tale, family friendly, but a few gaps in the story.","I generally enjoy watching Nicholas Cage movies, and this one was no exception.  The premise was a bit far-fetched, but the story was nevertheless reasonably well told and produced.  It offered a great action-adventure story without the usual elements of wanton violence, heavy language, the obligatory sex scene, etc.  I felt perfectly comfortable letting my kids, ages 13 and 9, watch this one with us.My only real complaints are that the characters were a bit underdeveloped, and the plot line had a few significant holes in it.  I thought Cage's character, Benjamin Franklin Gates, was just a little too slick in figuring out the riddles and clues, almost entirely without error, while his evil counterpart, Ian, was only slightly less so.  I also thought Gates came across as excessively altruistic, but I guess that's okay since this is a Disney flick -- family values and all that.In my estimation the biggest plot gaps occurred right at the beginning of the movie.  First, one wonders how, within a few short decades after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all clues to the treasure's location had been lost, except one, which was passed on to the original Gates ancestor and just happened to be the one clue that led to all the others.  Much bigger, though, [SPOILER ALERT!  SPOILER ALERT!] was how Ben Gates figured out that ""Charlotte"" was a ship and where to find it.  I also thought it was a bit incongruous how the FBI was initially portrayed in a very negative light, only to enjoy the balance of the movie as a bunch of high tech superstuds.Notwithstanding these minor lapses, I quickly got over them and settled into the movie.  It was a rolicking good yarn if you have enough sense not to take it too seriously.  It also has a lot of intellectual appeal as you try to unravel the clues along with Ben Gates -- although he was much more astute about it than I, of course.  Good movie.  Try it, you just might like it.",1.0,340,0.04706816308308153,0.05926132062329864,0.11978903416883027,0.16436682715521375,0.0,0.21451506762269112,0.03848137263050674,0.10873356053582797,0.042933108114659724,0.040748548486914414,0.0,0.05535326302086032,0.0,0.06695783984137504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05354458034620224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08721690008249883,0.04503057763716372,0.10655084652914008,0.046145291904208054,0.03817310260669098,0.04747951459502546,0.0,0.0,0.046123924200977606,0.17166209888529968,0.044519045816190886,0.11678717834181666,0.05594759387266086,0.026854667401198563,0.261198051791206,0.0,0.1377724813076474,0.04368405340421313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04723441083517015,0.0,0.13906794340727624,0.05708826591230077,0.10650226123279198,0.13904176877879088,0.05345855143106015,0.03765168367854902,0.2081828264719807,0.03593459071114425,0.19188075468402385,0.15917348917454952,0.0,0.0,0.09315488402261013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04299158558593775,0.0,0.1006353855547597,0.05332409601450051,0.16039416558574865,0.4747283789105211,0.0,0.057124966408654006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567600469550236,0.0,0.20808138089836678,0.1159912179444474,0.0,0.0,0.04757563833009604,0.41793695620706334,0.05527934279765619,0.0,0.0,0.049646134972095614,0.0552860516976019,0.0,0.0,0.05363716087570202,0.0,0.0,0.06843628190640193,0.0,0.11263521393653783,

577915,B00005ALS1,A2HRVVDJMY5M4Z,0,0,1247961600,"It's ""utopian,"" but it's still a nice thought...","This is one of those movies that requires a lot of leaps of faith and suspension of disbelief to truly resonate with someone.  Especially in pessimistic times like today, it's easy to dismiss the idea that everyone will help each other out like all the characters do without a second thought.  But that also works to this movie's benefit.Kevin Spacey portrays Mr. Simonet, a junior high social studies teacher who gives his students an assignment to think of a way to change the world for the better, and put it into action.  Haley Joel Osment plays Trevor, a student who decides to do a pyramid system, in which he helps three people in a big way, and those three help three people each, those nine help three people each, and so on.  Trevor helps his mother (Helen Hunt), by setting him up with his teacher and being there for her through her struggle with alcoholism, a homeless man Jerry by letting him stay at his home and giving him some money for nice clothes, and finally, he helps a bullied friend at school in a way that can only be seen to be believed.  Also, while that is going on, a newspaper reporter who has been on the receiving end of the ""Pay it Forward"" system is working his way up the ladder to find out how it all began.The movie really makes you feel good while you watch it, if only because you wish that life was that simple.  Admittedly, the script isn't very literate, and as I said before, the result shown in the movie is not exactly believable by real world standards.  Finally, the biggest shortcoming of the movie is that the ending is not exactly uplifting for a movie that should make you feel good.  It's realistic, and I give it props for that, but for a movie that's supposed to put a smile on your face, it's really out of place.All and all, though, there's more to recommend than condemn.  If you want a movie to put a smile on your face, and/or restore a sense of hope in the world, this is the movie for you.",0.0,362,0.0,0.0,0.1433538330116565,0.09835046611802233,0.038864701662043984,0.23532143499489663,0.0,0.03253088395772341,0.07706830997567793,0.07314685341348835,0.051957232195487105,0.049681733049281064,0.0,0.06009729766612064,0.12082679376824863,0.04280011169926345,0.10029370614546035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20414865876682897,0.0,0.0,0.07828060191594428,0.0,0.0,0.04141721641598687,0.0,0.08522946762977791,0.10291496187929285,0.1657517418471372,0.20699019030501126,0.05135783093331959,0.07991519303984591,0.15723163643768334,0.050215168390048213,0.16872184960723002,0.18754842874852867,0.0,0.0,0.07841631590610149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04239474353966494,0.0,0.24963790978208678,0.05123896645862481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06758773720959121,0.2102088192545929,0.16126355028731024,0.034444106494367584,0.09524298257072217,0.042874794619089246,0.04910484890935133,0.1254152644579576,0.1629452805081875,0.0,0.09299364349207735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038586640820812125,0.04321471157316541,0.0,0.04786047576433321,0.3167121737961256,0.32463802826806315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206735593724211,0.0,0.0679221938930901,0.0,0.25679669452966086,0.0,0.0,0.0883694211110783,0.04270100865190583,0.031259572842591316,0.0496153867384089,0.210053585705407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0481414638039265,0.12259608702329218,0.04510562850312479,0.09213638644783799,0.0,0.20218907884924037,

VING RHAMES is the only returning characer of the original MI and ANTHONY HOPKINS makes a nice, un-credited cameo. Less smart, less technological, and less clever than the first MI, but delivers lots of shoot-em-up action and a great chase/fight finale. The plot may be too dense for people who are looking for the plot to be near the complexity of the original MI, but for action-fans this movie will certanily deliver. The love story between Ethan and Nyah is a welcome subplot. Directed by John Woo. Filmed is 2:35:1 widescreen. RUN TIME: 123 minutes. GRADE: B-.ALL IN ALL:If you're looking for a crafty, clever, technological spy thriller or a shoot-em-up action film, this set has what you're looking for. Since the two movies are almost completely different in terms of complexity, action, direction, and scope, it depends on what tastes you have for you to decide if you like the first one better of the second one better. TOTAL RUN TIME: 233 minutes. OVERALL GRADE: B+.NOTE: The DVD of Mission Impossible has no special features, but the DVD of Mission Impossible 2 has many including a commentary with John Woo, cast/crew interviews, an on the set stunt featurette, a music video, and a breakdown of all of the stunts in the movie and how they were filmed.

1269777,B002IFT1ZA,AG8K92N37MT27,1,1,1371600000,Glad I Finally Took a Look,"I finally broke down and tried out Season One of Game of Thrones and found myself quickly being hooked.  From the very first scene, I was intrigued about what is going on in this world and that only grew as I was introduced to and got to know the characters in this fantasy world.Game of Thrones is set in some archaic world of sword-fighting, knights, and court intrigue...to put it mildly.  Also, on this world, the summers and winters can last for years and there are these scary beings who live beyond a huge wall of ice that is patrolled by the sworn men of the Night Watch.  The world is broken up into Seven Kingdoms, all ruled by a King who took the Iron Throne when the former royal family was driven across the sea (leaving just a sister and brother of that line to try and re-claim the throne).  The King's best friend and supporter is ""Ned"" (played wonderfully by Sean Bean, better known from The Lord of the Rings) who lives up north, has a boatload of kids he's trying to raise to be honorable, and tries to steer clear of politics.  To little avail, of course.There are many characters to love and characters to hate.  Just as there are dirty little secrets to be kept, double-crossing of all kinds, and hints of scary stuff to be unleashed once the long winter's night finally falls.  Oh, and hints of dragons once past and perhaps yet to be.Be warned, there are gory bits in this show, nudity, and general nastiness.  But there are also scenes where honor is upheld no matter the cost and where characters come into their own, overcoming huge trials in the process.  There are also plenty of gray characters who you never know whether to trust or not, as well as characters who are just plain crackerjack crazy.  This show will definitely keep you guessing...Perhaps, the biggest issue was in trying to keep all of then straight at first and figuring out who belongs to what house and has what totem (stags, dire wolves, lions, or dragons are the four main ones), but by the third episode or so you will figure it all out.  I could have used a bit less gore in a few scenes, as well...but overall this is a fabulous fantasy series, one well worth hitching a ride on.  Take a chance.  You might just get hooked, too!",1.0,408,0.03757698629294852,0.0,0.12751183532309,0.13122266955956463,0.0,0.36154602489950305,0.24577360443287158,0.14467951888647743,0.034275754766349455,0.16265853048562223,0.0,0.0,0.04517754350851543,0.08018393958195019,0.14329900504151943,0.03807028162520476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549490058404866,0.025941177067384535,0.06952157009636063,0.042503485617325955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07368041953571858,0.030475592405826115,0.03790538980635134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631653403595438,0.08933180436064676,0.15007643849170677,0.04170562422237796,0.0,0.14665467561742324,0.0,0.04330764688660095,0.04696966933188935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04267876889140571,0.030059316294071135,0.332406565472142,0.08606541242401371,0.06127539310098036,0.04235885171012603,0.11441013406044201,0.0,0.11155565367592592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05083566827065093,0.0,0.09926764563014885,0.03432244040251465,0.03843906416652448,0.0,0.0,0.07683065112669783,0.34290529972196265,0.04329747153670348,0.0,0.04679198967828553,0.21899433637369417,0.0,0.1208322570876002,0.0,0.33224458681483,0.046300940182299,0.0,0.07860373758821199,0.03798213043183099,0.11122033979378926,0.04413240225508996,0.0,0.0,0.11890534988914031,0.0,0.11266669669158277,0.038777920335097756,0.0,0.21809604572621544,0.08024203264055384,0.0,0.0,0.11989680817373159,
754774,B00009MEKB,A1ZSZ2D9FEDKZS,9,10,1126828800,One of those classics,"The story is one of those classics with an adorable girl having to live with her disgruntled aunt after her mother's death and the little girl trying to change her aunt. The act of the little Pollyana (Georgina Terry) and others are skillful and in general everything goes well. However there are discontinuities in the filming. some events happen suddenly and sometimes you notice a sudden change that is beyond comprehension. For instance you cannot imagine an orphan and abandoned boy become noble in one day. I think the director wanted the movie to fit the time constraint, so he had to rush some of the scenes. Also the abrupt and unexpected end of the movie (where the story is still flowing) is a little confusing. I think those ending moments (happy or sad) should linger for a while so that the audience can absorb the depth opf the feeling and enjoy. Close to the end most of the scenes become chop-chop rush-rush.So there are equally good and bad things that I think exists in this movie so I think a three-star is fair for this DVD.",0.9,187,0.0,0.08986521745163195,0.0,0.08308320114357419,0.13132642693112362,0.28915158969059457,0.17506209191285876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07231222036121557,0.0,0.0,0.08390833810933493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14782113757341556,0.0,0.0,0.06612884769471025,0.0,0.08078806624866315,0.0,0.0,0.07199901822475445,0.2608174058343495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17709873939467552,0.0,0.20361514898903296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572536121878906,0.15816434957154127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19730823973618852,0.0,0.11638894012553469,0.0,0.07243839965237277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2607736814931407,0.14602540143272044,0.15260579263317656,0.0,0.14593522132211353,0.5827672332462481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386555429736949,0.0,0.07650454570034633,0.07397958531201028,0.1972120932485171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07528453075253295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10377833788405486,0.0,0.11386840395114413,

These are ""Dinosaurus"" in 1960, and ""Over the Edge"" in 1979.  It is too bad because she is a superb actor.The timeline is a bit weird.  The movie trailer states that, the dinosaurs were quick frozen 70 million years ago, while the chapters in the movie believe that these Jurassic animals were frozen 1 million years ago.  This includes a Neanderthal warrior who was frozen along side the dinosaurs.Even with its time line inconsistencies, this is a fun movie for all.

88960,0790729385,A92XVSV8LADWZ,4,5,1094083200,Behind Pazuzu --- Powerful Subliminal Horrific Effects,"This film has been around for 30 years. You probably know the storyline, but how does it still be the scariest film in history?A subliminal message is not intense enough to produce a sensation but has sufficient intensity to influence the behavior and mental processes of one's mind. Exorcist, is the first movie applying such technique to increase the horrific effects, and also it brought the subliminal issues to the attention of the public. A report said a filmgoer fainted and broke his jaw on the seat in front of him while he's seeing the original release movie in 1974. He then sued Warner Brothers for the use of subliminal imagery in the Exorcist film that caused him to pass out, and the case eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Later on, subliminal technique was banned in advertising and movie industries for a while.Most of the subliminal shots in the film are: the ghastly demonic face, Father Karras's mother, and Pazuzu, which is the demon inside Regan and later inside Father Karras. If you want to examine those shots in details, make sure your dvd remote control have 'stepping' or 'very slow motion' feature. They are happened in a fraction of second. You should be able to find them from the following scenes:- Father Karras's dream- Lights flickering in Chris Macneil's kitchen- Chris Macneil entering her daughter's room- Father Karras jumping out from Regan's roomThere's also a new ending where Father Dyer and Lieutenant Kinderman meet together and chat about movies. Most people think that it's echoing Kinderman's earlier talk with Father Karras; however, it's also seeding the next Exorcist sequel (not in Exorcist 2 but in Exorcist 3 directed by the author himself William Peter Blatty, where Ed Flanders played Father Dyer and George Scott played Lt. Kinderman).If you want to know what's going on to Regan, check out the Exorcist 2, in which also reveals the truth of how Father Merrin was actually killed in the Exorcist I. If you are interested on Father Dyer and Lt. Kinderman after 25 years, go for Exorcist 3.*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Exorcist I ***1. Film Rewatchability: HIGH2. DVD Featurability: WEAK3.

629040,B00005JNCZ,A328S9RN3U5M68,7,9,1096070400,"Humanism, Awareness, Coming of Age: The Soul of Revolution","THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is certainly one of the finest films of the year - a daring, compassionate re-creation of the journey of two young, well-to-do Argentinean lads who leave their privileged positions of biochemist and fourth year Medical student to follow their idea of traveling by motorcycle from their native Buenos Aires down to Patagonia, up through Chile, Peru, Colombia to Venezuela.  Sounds like a light hearted Trip Movie, but instead this journey, factually made by one Ernesto (aka 'Che' and 'Fuser') Guevara de la Serna and his close friend Alberto Granado ('Chubby'), is one of the most touching and sensitive passages into self acceptance and awareness of the world as a place where equality of people is a microscopic speck of illusion that is revealed by a carefully constructed script by Jose Rivera based on the diaries of both of these men made during and after their journey.  Walter Salles (""Behind the Sun"", ""Central Station"") once again proves himself a director who can infuse his vision of a story with uncomplicated directness of approach, having the sensitivity to allow his well-chosen actors to create wholly believable, three-dimensional characters, whether the actors are the leads or simply minor roles that hold the camera's eye for seconds.Taken as simply a movie to enjoy, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is as beautiful as a National Geographic Magazine feature on the Amazon and the deserted and populated lands of South America.  But given his re-creation of Che Guevara's and Alberto Granado's meaningful excursion into manhood this movie goes far beyond entertainment and enters that rarefied arena of psychobiography.  Traveling on an old motorcycle, the two lads encounter hunger, accidents, lusting after women at every stop, ingratiating panhandling, and the gradual revelation of the quality of life of the indigenous peoples of South America.  They are touched by the plights of the people, the people in turn love the boys, and they eventually spend three weeks living and working in a leprosarium run by the nuns, adding their knowledge of medicine to helping not only the physical needs of the lepers but finding ways to break the psychosocial ostracism that historically curses the 'unclean'.  Breaking down these barriers, forming strong relationships with those tending the lepers as well as the lepers themselves, lays the seeds of 'revolution' or Change in the minds of the lads, especially Ernesto or 'Che'.  The film does not begin to preach or to make the Che Guevara of Cuban militancy fame a hero:  it doesn't have to, as the transformation in the mind of Che is so beautifully subtle.  The journey has given him the  insight that he must devote himself to changing the inequality and poverty of his America.  The events that followed this Motorcycle journey are provided in voice over, black and white footage of people's faces, and a final scene in Havana at the ending of the film. No more need be said.Gael Garcia Bernal gives an incredibly thoughtful, stunning portrayal of Che, saying so much more with his eyes, his body language (especially as he suffers through his own physical demon of asthma attacks), and his perfect embodiment of the spirit  of a man who becomes enlightened by the peasants he comes to love.  Bernal is already a brilliant actor and a magnetic screen presence, and if he is not nominated for an Oscar for this unique, artful role it will be a major surprise. His is a career to watch!  Likewise Rodrigo de la Serna is completely immersed in his role as Alberto and shows the same quality of quiet growth as a character as the movie progresses.  ALL of the many extras in this huge cast are memorable: the leper colony abounds with some of the most touching human beings ever captured on film.  The camera work, the musical scoring, the obvious commitment on the part of everyone involved in this glorious picture - every aspect of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is exactly right.  Ten Stars for this one!

In season two we get further into Davies's personal life.  In the case of a lot of mystery shows I'd say this would take away from it, but this show has always seemed more about Davies than the mysteries.  He's such an interesting, loveable character (c'mon, don't you just want to feed him tea and cookies?) that the mysteries take a back seat.  This isn't to say they aren't good - they are well-paced and would work even without such a good cast - but they just can't compare with the characters.Even the side characters (his landlady, his best friend, his dog) are just so unique and interesting, though not in a completely unbelievable, over-the-top way.  The only character I want to dislike is his wife, and somehow I can't even manage that.  You just know there's a lot of storyline left unsaid, and it's going to keep me coming back for more.",1.0,165,0.08127979844850551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477513348862998,0.2057977707040588,0.13290334725442832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771996088626707,0.11562634635322101,0.0,0.16469361290717202,0.0,0.09954594330414868,0.0,0.27347694128951944,0.0,0.0,0.056111302463595275,0.07518829691667181,0.09193591836776678,0.15061076523203118,0.0,0.0,0.07968613558810522,0.0,0.08199014203942225,0.0,0.10630133165023063,0.3185969468230341,0.0,0.0,0.1512557166332971,0.09661327011257988,0.13912218859603098,0.0902101276706191,0.0,0.31721709619783867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259145894835034,0.16313376775464272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08003489834034642,0.0,0.0650189227745616,0.13481292662368366,0.0,0.0,0.27486921670633724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735898518277726,0.07424014838307393,0.0,0.0,0.09208287497553222,0.1661862872546887,0.2732620411772024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07894821306784029,0.233830112739912,0.1306813354534653,0.0,0.17966297803520193,0.0,0.10266130253845984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010350281823129,0.09830554129280467,0.08573157692932527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059089699231505255,0.17667107872269286,0.12966963778051513,

The Rankin-Bass Original Television Christmas Classics add more warmth to the fire that is the holidays.  Born in 1985 I am nearly 20 years shy of the first time these classics were televised.  But I still remember seeing them as a child on TV during the season and falling in love with them.

Malick wanna-be,and the film just did not work.The film I watched is a masterpiece.I was surprised,and couldn't take my eyes off the screen.Jesse James is  director Dominic's beautiful,raw,vision of the age-old Frank and Jesse story with an ending we all know.So what's different about this ""oater""?Well,its the  great,complex performances by Pitt and co.It's Dominic's lurid,timed,melodic use of cinematic imagery that's at least hypnotic.It's cinematography soooo good,and soooo beautiful,that it becomes a character entity just as powerful as any or all of the actors.It's the dark,sinister,murderous,paranoid,over the top Jesse James presented to us through Pitt's brilliant,schizophrenic,interpretation of a character,said to be a hero,gone worse than bad,doomed from the start of the film,as the evil of bad men should be.It's the cramped,realism of the smokey,interiors,of little farm houses that set stark on lonely,snow covered vistas,where the hint of violence is omnipresent.It's the 2hr and 40 minutes of quality moviemaking you get to experience,which of course is an experience that's few and far between...",0.8,202,0.0666343305459292,0.0,0.11305677519209817,0.0,0.12260342807454304,0.23620230016141783,0.0,0.15393394472163904,0.060780339195022924,0.1730629838486218,0.0819527039706178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12705427192056676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15666991231913605,0.0,0.25219162044084154,0.0,0.0,0.12328086254065015,0.0753703686586095,0.061736419785813554,0.06374972377087396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207245552828152,0.295822163958874,0.08520840740905002,0.13002953529872624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06561374379636571,0.0,0.053303434243199,0.4052456745947631,0.0508725482074262,0.0,0.0,0.06762687700528533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060863125666714035,0.0,0.07123468504428687,0.07549084576810865,0.18165583098561075,0.5120550711430791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142294041904722,0.0,0.18411281914115932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479181864294551,0.0,0.0,0.08059227579349001,0.07028396162856697,0.0,0.06659634570245533,0.0,0.075934051240283,0.06445737775236758,0.0,0.048442572762359706,0.0,0.05315250326999688,

382062,6303619983,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0,0,1356393600,So sad we could believe it is a true story,"A comedy, one more, in this life that is so little comic indeed.  We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head.We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness.That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line.Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom.That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy.Enjoy the details.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",0.0,444,0.0,0.04395043406708169,0.029613357655115084,0.0,0.03211394592801352,0.37121578154458773,0.08561771891780773,0.02688030536019993,0.06368162969174178,0.09066198870191797,0.08586463674952925,0.04105207091587654,0.0,0.09931692693549575,0.03327977106724481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03915037569036047,0.0,0.0,0.07229496956526232,0.032291388713716944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07902213291766574,0.0342230916896709,0.056621229888411145,0.2112756098376893,0.0,0.0,0.27365795675004345,0.0,0.06603401231340886,0.1515741207470737,0.0,0.17924792241150017,0.0968571711949523,0.0,0.10217727671747853,0.0,0.040231083905420385,0.0,0.0,0.10509247029633817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22339128775717432,0.23159437283511042,0.13325224979518868,0.08538360976889735,0.0,0.07085498033897446,0.04057539091360793,0.03454359053426773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3164427954475309,0.0,0.06376836789530467,0.10712509177272404,0.0,0.03954716400887366,0.1427452468188747,0.30177985666049906,0.04022163140950057,0.0,0.04346789997105796,0.10171852034043218,0.0,0.03741612257762414,0.0,0.15432101268707654,0.0,0.08818063879807969,0.07301975031040991,0.035283890632773776,0.0,0.0,0.1735675099731108,0.1266589047807424,0.0,0.08200444891906192,0.0,0.18011573923238267,0.0,0.033767094057802746,0.111812492018669,0.20301972781490885,0.037937782284314374,0.16706905926774793,

I wish I had all her movies.  But I especially like &#34;Pinky.&#34;  Ethel Waters is also very very good in this movie.  Ethyl Barrymore played her role to perfection and, as the movie progressed, I ... like Pinky ... grew fond of the character she played.  I saw this movie many years ago ... I will be 79 in another week ... and I remembered it fondly.  At age 14 or 15, I had no idea I would eventually have 5 children of mixed heritage and that one of them, the lightest skin tone of the five, had issues with who he is ... I think still has an issue or two unresolved in his mind.  I will be certain he sees this.  Of course it is about more than race ... moneyed folk against those who have nothing can be an issue for many.  This is dealt with as well as the ethnic issue, and dealt with very well.  Again, all three of these women are ... to me, and I am sure to many others ... great actresses, deserving of many kudos.  I believe the character of an actress or actor shows through in the movies, and I believe all three of these women are good, intelligent, decent women!

It wasn't made as a star vehicle, like Heaven Can Wait was for Beatty, and the boxer main character was far more accessible to the average joe than the celebrity football star that Beatty plays. I fell in love with Mr Jordan the first time I saw it many years ago, and Mr Beatty's remake, while enjoyable, fell short.I was lucky enough to be able to tape Here Comes Mr Jordan off the TV years ago, but I can't wait to own the DVD.

254374,630150528X,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,4,5,1269907200,The African Queen-Restored to its original Glory!,"This newly released DVD of the legendary classical film The African Queen(Dec/51)restores the film to its original glory.In fact I have never seen it looking this good in all the years I have viewed it.The film opens in a missionary run by Rev.Samuel Sayer(Robert Morley)and his sister Rose(Kate Hepburn)in Central Africa in 1914.During the sermon the congregation is interrupted by the arrival of one Charlie Allnut(Humphrey Bogart),a Canadian who first came to the country to work in construction but is now his own boss ferrying supplies up and down the Ulangi river in his old battered boat The African Queen.After a prim and proper tea hosted by the Reverend and his sister,Charlie heads back to the open river saying he won't return for about two months.Soon after his departure the Germans arrive,round up the villagers and burn their homes and the mission to the ground.Rev.Sayer ultimately loses his mind and succumbs to death leaving his sister alone in the desolate surroundings.Allnut returns sooner than expected after hearing rumblings from the natives of what exactly the Germans have been up to.He takes care of the burial of the Reverend and the pair head out down the river to find refuge.Revenge is on Rose's mind and she persuades Charlie to go down river to the lake where there is the German ship ""Louisa"" which patrols there.It is her thought that Charlie can rig up some explosive torpedoes out of oxygen cylinders on board his boat,put them on the bow and then steam into the ship thus sinking it.Charlie agrees but is sure the river's dangers such as falls,rapids and shallows will be enough to dissuade her from thinking she can actually accomplish it.His feelings are soon put to the test as they encounter their first set of rapids.After a very bumpy and unsettling ride through Charlie says to Rose that she has probably re thought her ambitious plan and wouldn't blame her if she gave up.The experience has had the opposite effect and she is exhilarated and is more determined than ever to carry through.Charlie is beside himself and decides to have a few drinks.Unfortunately this has an undesirable side effect and Charlie gets quite obnoxious towards Rose and insults her.Next morning a hung over Charlie awakes to his entire stash of gin being dumped into the river and a scorned Rose giving him the silent treatment.After a few minutes Charlie finally apologizes and Rose tells him it wasn't his remarks that infuriated her but his backing out of their deal.Charlie relents and agrees to carry on.Their next major hurtle is a French fort over looking a section of the river.They barely make it by as the rifle fire they take riddles the steam engine and tears the hose.They pull over so Charlie can make repairs.Both are so jubilant at surviving that they hug and kiss each other.After an awkward few moments they passionately embrace and both realize that love has somehow touched them both.The morning after the night before Rose serves him breakfast in ""bed"" and finally asks what Mr.Allnut's first name was;after all Mr Allnut at this point is way too formal!After several more harrowing experiences farther along the river and with forced major repairs to the boat's propeller and shaft,they finally reach the river delta which empties out into the lake.However the farther they go, the more the delta grass closes in on them.Eventually Charlie and Rose are forced to get out and pull the boat through the reeds.Along with the oppressive heat and brackish water,leeches are the newest problem to confront them.At the end of the day they are stuck on mud flats and can go no farther and become resigned to death.That night rains come down upstream which filters down to the hapless travelers and raises their boat out of the flats and into the lake which was ironically only about 100 yards,unseen,away from them.They put their original plan into action and Charlie makes and places two explosive ""torpedoes"" in either side of the bow,sticking far enough out to impact the German ship.That night they spot their target and head out into open water to sink her.Along the way a storm brews up and the African Queen flounders and they have to abandon the boat.Both are picked up by the German ship and are interrogated then sentenced to death as spies.Charlie gets his last request to be married to Rose and just as they are about to be hanged the ship hits the partially submerged Queen and sinks.Rose and Charlie are now in the water and cannot believe their luck that they did what they set out to do and are still alive.With their futures before them they swim to the lake's nearest shore.The African Queen took the best actor honour at the /51-52 OSCAR ceremonies with Bogie getting what would be his one and only in his 35 year long acting career.Close but no cigars were Hepburn for best actress,James Agee and John Huston for the screenplay and Huston again for director.The story is fairly simple but well written and is greatly enhanced by its' principals Bogie and Hepburn as both are in top form here.Technically the film has been beautifully restored and remastered in a hi-def print which is simply gorgeous;it has never looked as good as it does right now.It is full screen and its' main special feature is an approximately 60 minute documentary on the making of the film.You will find there was as much going on behind the camera as on.If you have been waiting for the best print of The African Queen you can possibly get,then wait no more my friends;as this is one classic that is a must own by all!",0.8,951,0.04513315179501193,0.17047511549641936,0.038288135818235744,0.0,0.04152123300813462,0.3961555962498991,0.13529769524977098,0.12743308542253223,0.054890789828934895,0.05209778907354818,0.0,0.05307764439117662,0.05426206649462494,0.05350428951470188,0.10039999365867887,0.07620940230428809,0.01785818563730284,0.0,0.017686095831979897,0.0,0.07117328881332108,0.05134331816390787,0.051929261223699896,0.041750654931784856,0.03403353058045989,0.02787711362041463,0.0,0.017028408784504793,0.0884964412340268,0.0732075492894529,0.030351728203035614,0.12827446460115502,0.05902714117114029,0.22113865678907402,0.0,0.02845922057116159,0.13998245051831465,0.10729508361579192,0.15450389828259706,0.08348666096051158,0.057713853419043844,0.014678726682354775,0.0,0.01733872061638719,0.0,0.0,0.060390086618527114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01702064413209628,0.014813960683320816,0.051260825968939175,0.0,0.12476516094978896,0.10337186949881183,0.03679847548929889,0.0339177188433243,0.0,0.01748710943522345,0.13398781402254595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741425017517125,0.0,0.027482777190368336,0.015389526844621824,0.016083030207967763,0.034087932084172275,0.09228013691086154,0.556370101044112,0.15601182116935366,0.10955302316157195,0.0562011534527183,0.043838466043849986,0.23082931194840653,0.040313834039810405,0.0,0.25772235234140195,0.018537120435082276,0.03800393405976468,0.11014472505399975,0.015206588104338895,0.03339626839332155,0.0,0.037401907572024176,0.0,0.015868380372639098,0.017671065393751934,0.0601432315736057,0.0,0.08572015438487501,0.014552881828188268,0.03212583194114941,0.04374853966740141,0.01635035758368979,0.036001562238493774,

However, here the inconsistencies, illogic and absurdities pile up at an annoying pace.  This prevented me from having any investment in the story.The underlying sequence of events is not that substantial (in addition to painfully contrived).  Consequently, the different vantage points have a disproportionate amount of repetition relative to the new information that is layered on.  My reaction at the end was ""Is that all there was?""Two of the worst, most unforgivable absurdities (see other reviews for many more examples):1. The bomb does far more damage to a hotel well over a mile away than it does to the immediately surrounding buildings.  This is absolutely essential to the plot.2.

This is one of the best, if not the very best, seasons of either show.  The addition of Spike to the cast is priceless.  He brings every other actor on the show, especially David Boreanez, to a higher level.  The season was much crazier, funnier, darker and heartbreaking than any before it, and that's saying a lot.  Some people criticize the stand alone nature of the episodes, something the network demanded in order to get a fifth season.  I like the freedom it gave the producers to do different things.  One episode has Angel turned into a muppet, the next has him and Spike on a German submarine during World War II.  There is not a weak episode in the set.  Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof get their finest showcases of the series.  It is worth going back to previous seasons to see how much they have evolved.  Every other series finale I've ever seen, the characters were the exact same as when they appeared in their pilot episodes.  That is not the case here, which is what made watching this series and the Buffy series so rewarding.  The packaging and extras are just OK, but are more than adaquate.

This is only a step above that.  It is more like layered 2D images than true 3D. Yes, there are a few parts where true 3D is apparent, but those are few and far between.Sorry, I can't help but think that some of the people have either let their love of the movie color their perception of what good 3D looks like, or they simply do not have many 3D movies to compare to.I actually found the 2D blu-ray disc, or even the regular dvd more appealing, or at least less distracting.  One thing I noticed in all three versions that I didn't notice before was that the grass in the movie doesn't move when the animals walk through it. Although I didn't pick up on this when I saw the movie when it first came out, it was one of the things that was painfully apparent in the 3D, and far less apparent in the 2D versions.And, yes, I know there are people that will disagree with me and mark my review as ""not helpful"", but I have to call it as I see it.",0.8670212765957447,290,0.0,0.0,0.04329676927489476,0.0,0.0,0.12922453563595668,0.12517900418451242,0.15720343404129536,0.04655346516129321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14520819019234005,0.04865731830213216,0.05170720649044807,0.12116574390727311,0.0,0.0599990671454578,0.05724054675030056,0.0,0.058059755400561165,0.0352334088944716,0.0,0.0,0.04728575565299229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655682786862816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18995297837632188,0.0,0.11647680572680778,0.169934229384724,0.0,0.0,0.09473546861904042,0.05882061662234529,0.06379438993496035,0.11628005731570679,0.10243495501684725,0.0,0.11309619096013081,0.18570679237822058,0.0,0.10051102630819984,0.0,0.08165336363312845,0.14108622088138617,0.11689438222983242,0.08322448031900335,0.057531959275648664,0.20718972643643366,0.05932401719133313,0.05050510944105289,0.13123712269853458,0.0,0.0,0.05553303294378036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04661687377626215,0.15662426517292993,0.0,0.11564135722197427,0.2434872837908916,0.5147601005188326,0.11761359284405257,0.0,0.12710612945884722,0.14871948522198963,0.048942201257645576,0.08205742381216029,0.0,0.14101747086560013,0.06288611936936629,0.0,0.05337995303538566,0.0,0.18882487960923797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989615448926434,0.051008117108082285,0.15800497252241646,0.0,0.0,0.05449252243266108,0.03710360378509687,0.0,0.16284431722407666,

It's a bad mish-mash of ""Vertigo"", ""Lipstick"" and ""Body Double"" despite predating the last one by a good two years.  The direction is TV movie of the week, the extra's acting is fairly atrocious and the script has holes Morgan Fairchild could park her little Fiat convertible in (for instance, the police call with the name of her stalker and his phone number, but fail to mention that he lives right up the street?)  Add in a soundtrack that's completely looped in (witness the scene at the diner), a bad ""Pino Donaggio does Bernard Herrmann"" score and Andrew Stevens heaving and sweating as the main looney and I defy you not to have a good time.  Then of course there's Morgan Fairchild.  I might be biased, because I think Miss Fairchild is great; she seems like a gal that would be a blast on the next barstool.  She is of course lovely and this movie lives and breathes on her creamy flesh.  Would that she would have gotten some real parts; she could have easily inhabited some of the complex Hitchcock blondes.

513159,B000021Y6M,A1C58YXM2A30CY,1,1,1291507200,You Got Some Mail Here!,"When it comes to comedy, Jimmy Stewart is tops and Shop Around the Corner is no exception.Shop Around the Corner has been done a few times both in film and stage, it's most recent incarnation was the Tom Hanks' film, You've Got Mail.In both films we have a man who is in correspondence with a woman but neither knows the others' names, even though they know each other in the real world.Is it a shame that in the real world they hate each other but in the correspondence world they love each other?  What's up with that?  The film has a great way of resolving this with each finding the other somewhat attractive and things work out in the end.The films diverge in the subplot.  Matuschek runs a novelty store in Bucharest where Jimmy Stewart's character (Kralak) works.  Carla, played by Margaret Sullavan, is a new clerk who instantly dislikes Kralak.  Only the audience knows that they love each others' letters!But in the subplot the owner discovers some disturbing news and attempts suicide!  Kralak comes to his aid and at the same time realizes who his pen pal really is.  The rest of the film is a resolution of not only his relationship with his boss and crew, but the humorous way that he plays on Carla before she realizes who her pen pal really is.And just like in You've Got Mail, [You've Got Mail (Deluxe Edition)] the meeting is a match made in heaven.  Ah, Hollywood!The best scene for me is when Carla reaches not her post office box and a hesitant gloved hand gropes but does not find the letter she was expecting.  The look of disappointment on her face is quite heartbreaking.Great performances, a bit of overacting and some dark moments pepper this entertaining romantic comedy.Cast!*  Actors: Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut, Sara Haden*  Directors: Ernst Lubitsch*  Writers: Ben Hecht, Mikl&oacute;s L&aacute;szl&oacute;, Samson Raphaelson*  Producers: Ernst Lubitsch",1.0,323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141839865680793,0.0,0.0,0.04286684545595751,0.0,0.0,0.05526783118196783,0.056501127075416616,0.1671362439495098,0.04480409217084563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05270760539217148,0.17786441079305945,0.0,0.03244323679736834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992215551734892,0.0,0.09214814316703526,0.038114186507188556,0.04740623504436831,0.17172972006435633,0.0,0.18421094743620342,0.0,0.0,0.3498207894834367,0.0,0.2949454210494881,0.07823847616362742,0.0,0.045853281407953216,0.04361663174180466,0.1083250956137486,0.0,0.05353585634594915,0.0,0.05644405609136554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05337604387677988,0.11278071700011724,0.12991344909628766,0.07175825903048136,0.0,0.10595188128329493,0.0,0.21850433414197007,0.04650555471316269,0.0,0.0,0.10344963176743704,0.0,0.0,0.1217207220513577,0.0,0.0,0.09614734580349747,0.0,0.0,0.12811729148216672,0.5191381327804679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802656597369889,0.05037280458619203,0.048710297671534925,0.05194005738770873,0.0,0.0,0.04915273630622649,0.0,0.06954865253879318,0.0,0.11683576036304798,0.05683970634481647,0.0,0.0,0.04696872865415729,0.0969949242220646,0.0,0.18184067329675407,0.0,0.13666131565538178,0.0,0.11246137353534919,

1133347,B0011W8DS2,A2X1OCV002VU1Q,0,0,1361404800,Bhool Bhulaiyaa,"Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a hauntingly comedic film!  A work project brings Siddharth and his wife Avni to India.  The couple go straight to Siddharth's ancestral mansion, unbeknownst to the family, who tell them that they cannot stay there for the simple reason it was haunted.  Siddharth and Avni considers them superstitious.  Curious about the mansion and the locked quarters, Avni  gains access with the consent of her husband  and inadvertently, unleashes a series of strange and deathly happenings!  Siddharth suspecting his childhood friend of a psychological problem , contacts a Psychologist friend, Aditya (Akshay Kumar) for help.  Siddharth's messages go unanswered.  In the meantime the family has contacted another well known Psychologist.  Aditya dramatically and unexpectedly arrives creating disturbances in the house.  Was he the ghost?  Siddharth vouches for Aditya's humanness.  He employs unusual techniques in his investigations, diverts some near fatal incidents, chases after a singing voice and the sound of anklets jingling at night.  What Aditya suspects is confirmed when he, Siddharth and a bridegroom to be, sees who is singing and dancing one night.  Siddharth is devastated.  The film then transports you back in time to a scene of two court dancers, exquisitely executing a classical Indian dance, in the presence of dignitaries.  The Prince enters as the dance is in progress.  Reincarnation or d&eacute;j&agrave; vu?  What follows is a horrifying memory of the past, but the Psychiatrists have concocted  a somewhat terrifying scene that could solve the problem and give rest to the disturbed soul.  Akshay Kumar is his usual comic self as one of the capable Psychologists, the Hindustani way!  I also loved watching Vidya Balan who I think is a great actress!  I really enjoyed watching this movie more so after buying the DVD and saw parts that were cut when watching it on TV.  It's a great movie to own!",0.0,307,0.05579306091027689,0.14049286203597824,0.0,0.0649450201467221,0.0,0.31078562085022143,0.0,0.08592613730939413,0.05089150200913022,0.04830199648375449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03968481657225768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06559001860763276,0.0,0.10558027915219217,0.0,0.11554979376910242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10675554754497305,0.0,0.05469911960212894,0.04524914718065354,0.16884199061145125,0.06795915196404981,0.0,0.21869516410264453,0.0,0.0,0.20765355161395072,0.0,0.2546611545295437,0.09288468802686695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05599012555760771,0.0,0.08242329558828752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24677311280073824,0.042595688401814755,0.09097966805884321,0.0,0.05662412208564153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061407681005421766,0.0,0.07547911144676595,0.0,0.0,0.05096081929077419,0.057073045498047065,0.0,0.0,0.1140755984173347,0.5895240391402123,0.0,0.13542813322498973,0.06947519180705386,0.05419258591348686,0.05350283002575818,0.02990128686326558,0.057828846173511354,0.21582125471907,0.0,0.07047001118347347,0.0,0.0,0.0825681328486557,0.0,0.06935368429854877,0.0,0.05884890446157206,0.06553427726525744,0.1115225122466827,0.11515233576014429,0.0,0.1619108816847387,0.0,0.040561065004141035,0.0,0.04450469942716033,

THis movie lacks: a) heart - commercially driven beyond limits; b) acting - with a screenplay like this, even Pacino could not save this bomb; c) exciting car chases - the car chase with the SHelby is boring, almost slept; d) plot - they managed to destroy the original film of 1974. Be it: even this being a remake, they didn't have a good plot !!All in all, I went into the movie to watch as a brainless action movie. But even so it was disgraceful.

122942,0792102320,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,1,3,1287792000,A problematic film...,"...with a great cast, from a terrific storyteller. Despite the film's numerous faults, it is a movie I like and have watched more than once.Otto Preminger made some of my favorite films, (Laura, Anatomy of a Murder, Man with the Golden Arm, etc), and he does tell an interesting story here, but the production values of the film are weak. First of all this is a period story of WWII in the pacific, told in a 1965 film. Preminger doesn't even bother to dress the actors in any type of 1940's clothing, let alone have their hair and makeup reflect the era the story takes place. The women in the film are all dressed like Jackie Kennedy in 60's era sheath dresses and Jackie-flip hairdos. The music gives a nod to 40's swing, but with 60's era arrangements. The naval battles against the Japanese look like they were done with toy boats, and the story is simplistic.All of that said, Preminger's talent as a storyteller still prevails in this tale of an aging rear admiral (Wayne) who has to deal with WWII, a son from whom he is estranged (Brandon de Wilde), a mature nurse who is hot for him (Neal), a violent, alcoholic assistant (Douglas), an admiral who actively works against him (Andrews), and the suicide of his son's fiancee (Haworth). So this is a character-driven movie masquerading as an action film. I didn't mind the lack of action, because the actors really bring the characters to life, and their predicaments are absorbing.Wayne is really brilliant as Admiral Torrey, who puts up with naval incompetence and internal politics to get his job  done This is the kind of role Wayne really excelled at in the great John Ford films. Patricia Neal is very good as the mature nurse who finds Wayne a big hunk of Heaven. Of course Douglas is terrific as the captain who can barely conceal his violent, angry nature, and I liked Tom Tryon's performance as the uber sexy naval officer and husband who sends his wife swooning at every opportunity. To be honest, he sent me swooning too.So if you don't mind the character driven story, which fails to deliver on the action hero end of things, this is a good film to watch if you have three hours to relax for a movie.",0.3333333333333333,389,0.0,0.0,0.10291877816536268,0.0,0.1488124881783445,0.2047825051672035,0.09918576973437976,0.18684056138468808,0.07377341441412082,0.03500980579219426,0.04973590862155989,0.0,0.0,0.05752796249574815,0.0,0.040970281797497635,0.0,0.04952742583001636,0.0,0.045354632164007466,0.22957716063644099,0.04600373335376763,0.05583448764959385,0.07481736925125938,0.04574118469259855,0.07493387732979125,0.07737756736506543,0.0,0.039646509330491506,0.09839120349341458,0.12237848807890364,0.0,0.10577691353735662,0.15851260362500247,0.0,0.0764985849044,0.17559444503003907,0.0,0.2537990671483761,0.022441273139940657,0.0,0.0,0.11259568372516171,0.0,0.0,0.046067337988310655,0.040582244311820476,0.0,0.08961193474484316,0.0,0.0,0.039820030428092866,0.0,0.0,0.31301165417439725,0.03087381241133411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13352684004719573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387389823446204,0.04136715631470275,0.216156491146313,0.0458143005047527,0.027561072950421154,0.4855606304321368,0.09319130483150626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03877942579794948,0.10836386922139986,0.0,0.20112372416487842,0.049827910006895536,0.0,0.042295685004776755,0.040875415695143455,0.0,0.0474941839041841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04749994796923426,0.0,0.0,0.04608327548418159,0.27382774041458735,0.0,0.17639457313079984,0.0,0.0645149682087738,

603631,B00005JLQN,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,3,5,1064880000,"Umm.....Predictable and tepid..those are compliments, right?","I waited a while to see this film.  It didn't seem like it would be worth watching.  So I asked several people who said it was okay.  Others said it was good.  I should have considered the source.This movie is just plain boring.  I read another review that said it should have been a straight to video release.  I couldn't agree more.The only reason this film made it to the theaters is that Colin Farrell is seeing an upward spike in his popularity. (I doubt it will last.  I like him well enough, but the press on his personal life is far more interesting than his acting ability).A guy is stuck in a phone booth, because someone on the other end of the phone is going to kill him or someone else - that's the premise of the movie.  It doesn't deviate from that - not once.  I knew what was coming from a mile away.  I knew what was going to happen at the end and I knew who would be blamed with everything.There's just not much to this film.  It's threadbare in its plot.  You don't really care about the lead (Farrell), nor do you give a flip about anyone else.  There's no reason to.  The screenwriters nor the director bother giving us enough information to feel any identification with any of the characters.Phone Booth garnered hype only because at the time of its initial release, a sniper started shooting up D.C. in reality.  Since the premise of this film is a sniper, it gave this weak film millions of dollars of worth of free publicity.Don't bother!

210563,6300214087,AE42JLYPXUI45,2,3,1106524800,Friday The 13th (1980),"In 1974, director Tobe Hooper had brought us the frightening, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In 1978, just four years after ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", John Carpenter, brought us the terrifying, ""Halloween"". Both films may have chilled us all to the bone, but those films did not define the term, ""Slasher Flick"".In 1980, director Sean S. Cunningham brought us the infamous, ""Friday The 13th"", the film that had definite potential in defining, ""Slasher Flick"". It was the one horror movie that really made you re-think your camping trip.In the summer of 1957, 11-year-old Jason Voorhees (played by Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake, while at Camp Crystal Lake. In the summer of 1958, two counselors, Barry (played by Willie Adams) and Claudette (played by Debra S. Hayes), were brutally slaughtered. Since then, Camp Crystal Lake was shut down, due to the unsolved murders. But on Friday, June 13th, 1980, exactly 22 years after the two murders, Steve Christy (played by Peter Brouwer) has re-opened Camp Crystal Lake, where has hired seven new counselors: Jack Burrell (played by Kevin Bacon), Ned Rubinstein (played by Mark Nelson), Marcie Cunningham (played by Jeannine Taylor), Brenda (played by Laurie Bartram), Bill (played by Harry Crosby), Annie (played by Robbi Morgan), & Alice Hardy (played by Adrienne King).Only six of the counselors have arrived at Camp Crystal Lake. Annie is still on her way, but she has come across the anonymous killer, who had killed the two others 22 years ago. Poor Annie didn't have a chance to live the rest of her life.Steve Christy goes off on an errands, while the other six continue to get the place in shape for the little kids. But Ned, Jack, Marcie, Brenda, and Bill meet the same fate as Annie, where they are killed by the same anonymous killer, until Alice is the only one left alive. She finds Bill's dead body and runs back to the main cabin, barricading the door. But as she locks all the doors in the cabin, Brenda's dead body is thrown through the kitchen window. Alice runs into the living and sees a jeep pull up. She runs out to meet the driver in the jeep. The driver in the jeep is a woman named Pamela Voorhees. She reveals her true identity as the brutal killer of this whole ordeal. Her motive: the death of her son, Jason Voorhees. She claims the two counselors she murdered in 1958 were the ones that allowed Jason to drown, while they were sleeping together. After a long battle with Mrs. Voorhees, Alice grabs a machete and decapitates Mrs. Voorhees.Alice, relieved that she has finally stopped the madness, climbs into a canoe and drifts off into the lake. She awakes the next morning to the sound of a police calling out to her. But as she looks up, Jason's rotting corpse jumps up out of the water and pulls Alice underneath the water, but Alice finds herself in the hospital. The sheriff of Crystal Lake asks if Alice remembers anything. She remembers everything, including her dream of Jason pulling her into the water. The sheriff brings to Alice's attention that there was no boy.Advice from me to you: Camping does not seem like a good idea right now. But cheer up. Grab your copy of Friday The 13th and enjoy it, until everything dies down at Camp Crystal Lake.",0.6666666666666666,563,0.0,0.10052447141999732,0.04515491429440982,0.0,0.024483925344147645,0.10781631847547528,0.02175854111085969,0.08197502619482518,0.0728270641668251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514400148738907,0.30447311536510985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02518135464996539,0.0,0.018372751426655134,0.02461920912172387,0.030102950763763268,0.02465754696731309,0.0,0.09037064491677929,0.10436781874816504,0.0647527075272481,0.0,0.2593368414721943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025172425576106053,0.21461384961774782,0.1265379000921509,0.06073779023196428,0.029537868113726762,0.0,0.02596692021411156,0.024700295413345938,0.0,0.0,0.030317597075795698,0.0,0.0,0.019658313600741235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030227094553212465,0.042578819372119964,0.16185525965529018,0.06095553894071575,0.043398091115546954,0.060001028570686725,0.0,0.030934997653831914,0.07900891659240578,0.0,0.0,0.029291996688140264,0.0,0.0,0.37912046847532427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069175050873415,0.6391092775122474,0.0,0.0,0.03314026934416319,0.025850333722249815,0.05104262835726591,0.014263173294112438,0.0,0.1617763890782286,0.0,0.13445922727596638,0.11134166565864721,0.0,0.05907857374719642,0.0,0.0330823092082577,0.0,0.0,0.09378125673451665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025744298500511128,0.0,0.019347979964653626,0.0,0.04245825560851122,

While ""Demonia"" pales in comparison to some of his early works such as ""Zombie"" (1980) and ""The Beyond"" (1981) this one definitely one of Fulci's better films later in his career. It certainly isn't as bad as ""Sweet House of Horrors"" (1989) (which I contend is by far his worst film.)The story is based around the 16th century crucifixion of a couple of nuns. Professor Pual Evans and his prize pupil Liza Harris struggle to uncover the horrifying mystery. The story moves a bit slowly, the ending is quite confusing and the gore is sprinkled throughout the film but not incredibly over the top as it was in the previously mentioned ""Zombie"" and ""The Beyond"". I recommend this film for Fulci fans only.

As such, he narrates wonderful descriptions of what goes into presenting The Greatest Show on Earth every day of its season. The circus has changed dramatically from what it was at the time of this film's making, so in a way the film is a good historical account. The circus is the star, much like the ship was the star in Cameron's ""Titanic"". Performances are okay; the script is a bit corny; too much time was given to the parades around the rings. The crash scene, though dated by today's special effects standards, is still gripping. I probably give this film a higher rating than it deserves because it has a nostalgic value to me personally, and I adored Jimmy Stewart.",0.0,129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04828749371196482,0.07795965819858022,0.0734280045524124,0.08697845750356976,0.0,0.11727673576712629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090920466428506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706702335629569,0.0,0.0,0.08820927462324374,0.0,0.08834663701914049,0.0,0.0,0.1869720822522748,0.0,0.09618905138348084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11829994466318448,0.11334458719094256,0.2720252096691419,0.15874883961624417,0.12193574338232387,0.0,0.08849980235427309,0.0,0.0,0.10862628580606722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21576361017075882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581595933804814,0.07280011646792942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259512263957201,0.08709692738552866,0.0,0.0,0.10802962615068212,0.0,0.5953722976582054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15331250048025707,0.19767008796403154,0.15808252366755202,0.1174936740408455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211675286165777,0.0,0.11853209758664802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19060266860269098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

[Review includes proper episode order] Very smart, funny show...would be nice to have the orginal music","4.5 starsFound this at the library and enjoyed it a lot. It's both intelligently funny and very well-directed, and all the actors are good and often excellent (Valley). There is little wasted time; the quick cuts and superfast flash-forwards make the viewer pay attention, and that attention is well-rewarded. Creator JH Wyman is clearly a big Guy Ritchie fan, as the cuts and pace are extremely reminiscent of his style; if you loved Lock Stock and Snatch you'll love this too is my guess.By far my favorite episode is Horse Heir, which is as funny as any tv episode I've seen since the best of Arrested Development or Eastbound And Down. That one alone is worth checking this series out for; it's better than most comedy movies these days.The rest are hit and miss, mostly hit. There are plenty of nice themes running through this sadly brief series, my favorite being Eddie's hallucinations of Moneypenny's lust for him. Some of those are flat out classic. His tension with his flatmate is also often very funny, especially if you've ever suffered an insufferable roommate.But imagine my surprise upon reading all these reviews lamenting the loss of the original music (which may have been either greed from the studio, or lack of foresight in buying the rights to both tv and dvd, which is not uncommon, moreso if the show's future is uncertain; Malcolm In The Middle saw a similar fate). I'd LOVE to see the shows again with it, especially with the Specials and Madness and other great ska groups providing the tunes. It does suck that it's gone, but the good news is that the show was very enjoyable without it as well. Kinda glad I never saw this on tv, so I don't know what I'm missing.Sidenote: the theme is from the song Mastermind by Daniel Ash, of Bauhaus and Love And Rockets fame, and while it's a good one, I kept thinking I'd heard it before, especially the Link Wray-ish guitar tone. Finally I realized it's a lift, of both sound and melody, of parts of Robert Palmer's ""Johnny and Mary"", with a House beat. Check it out and see what you think. I rather like Ash's background music during the show; it may not be as fitting as the original pop tunes, but it certainly has its moments.All in all, Keen Eddie is very good humor, and a little too smart for the average American tv viewer, just like AD and Malcolm, both cancelled far too soon. And make sure to catch Horse Heir...it is truly hilarious.PS And looking around online I found various folks pointing out that this dvd set is in the wrong running order, which I wondered about due to strange shifts in character history (and matchbooks!) while watching it in the dvd sequence. Apparently the proper order is as follows; watch the shows in this sequence and you're bound to have a more logical viewing experience:1, 2, 9, 12, 6, 10, 7, 11, 8, 5, 4, 3, 13Enjoy.",1.0,505,0.03323190438878461,0.0,0.1127674552413628,0.03868306676191013,0.03057241939800169,0.420710432974016,0.13584652684968027,0.17913002021064728,0.030312399093657513,0.028770017323782884,0.0,0.039081498486982086,0.03995359805309544,0.07091215333049437,0.06336456571347455,0.0,0.0,0.040700165764690925,0.11720173754578676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06882468242518108,0.06148268922869921,0.0,0.12315686420614085,0.031793291953385386,0.0,0.03258032241127353,0.0539033101338429,0.0,0.0,0.043462161044100146,0.0976957080124542,0.0,0.09429639338795616,0.14429829332559796,0.0,0.303366583614145,0.27662356405349714,0.042495176659520684,0.032424195226114935,0.06168518977385719,0.1148997609402891,0.0,0.0,0.03334928159325524,0.03991324149252227,0.0,0.040306476187956755,0.0,0.13089166755734702,0.0,0.05316702714204946,0.20210431172290683,0.025371180954204157,0.05419002974432496,0.0,0.06745381524326079,0.03862769997275828,0.13154174696485837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07231854606916394,0.08991493114109898,0.0,0.13168377379028542,0.0303536864014069,0.03399429893652776,0.0,0.03764882978849906,0.11324435087589826,0.44690160157019365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06455723361563291,0.0,0.12467028747853515,0.03444447491494198,0.0918208309788802,0.12284128417752334,0.0,0.0,0.1343608044724773,0.02458994229407457,0.03902930801195588,0.0,0.0,0.10515615031034031,0.0,0.06642592113988442,0.0,0.1514794617126572,0.0,0.0,0.0966372098704203,0.0,0.1325412060285948,

What happens next is up to you to watch it.... it's a beautiful and sad film. If you give this a chance, you will not regret it. It has basically nothing to do with the Showtime cable softcore porn series that followed. This is a beautiful, intelligent, engaging film with a gorgeous score (thanks to George S. Clinton). Duchovny rules in this film. It always makes me cry, always. Intense, passionate, and yes, there is sex in the film (don't shy away from it because of that). Just watch, enjoy, and prepare to have your life and perspective of love and lust forever changed.",0.5714285714285714,132,0.09784913951821694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001846226104639,0.2973009554040753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203433950490256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328638164205665,0.0,0.11615019304898971,0.11983894006591567,0.0,0.0,0.4629132770537877,0.0,0.0,0.09051585136247117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593059957903263,0.07935736170991389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09588617865334473,0.0,0.09254982646331816,0.12139335974654683,0.0,0.22331069879374235,0.325799898753103,0.0,0.19094178686411767,0.0,0.11277157644778704,0.0,0.1114667452155693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827339347947447,0.1081968633277495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323742771263738,0.12671706066190944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333761936585897,0.1409863007742896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09504224742982322,0.0,0.1573214558758315,0.0,0.2703603499823279,0.0,0.0,0.10234067237272797,0.0,0.0,0.22983842034946372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09779336069942787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447370347717665,0.1422709291745136,0.0,0.23415527696898908,

749059,B00008XRYS,AMCH34Z0KHD41,45,51,1051747200,Short is finally Funny,"I had always found Martin Short's over-expressive antics and  routine comedies rather annoying and far from humorous. When Primetime Glick first came on Comedy Central, I had no desire to watch it. But then I kept seeing commercials where Glick (Short in a hideous fat suit) ripped into real celebrities during interviews. The clips were hilarious and I found myself tuning in.How glad I was when I did.Primetime Glick makes constant fun of Hollywood and the simple-minded morons who worship everything Hollywood does. The entire Entertainment industry is shredded by this mock talk show, and Short, as Glick, is the wonderfully obnoxious center of it all.The interviews are the best part of this underrated show, where huge stars get insulted, interupted and even assulted by Glick who half the time doesn't know who the guest is nor does he care about them.It's as if Glick speaks for the cynical at-home-viewer who always rolls their eyes in disgust when someone like Julia Roberst comes on TV and starts babbling about her latest movie. Glick simultaniously makes fun of Hollywood phonies (himself being one) and points out other Hollywood phonies for the insipid blowhards they are. And when he has a good guest on he still rips into them, all in good fun.This DVD comes out right alongside the joyously surpirsing release of a third Season on Comedy Central. Just when everyone thought this show was dead and buried, it comes back with guests like Steven Spielberg, Ice Cube, Mel Brooks and Brandon Frasier.Guests of this show have to have a good sense of humor and be a little masochistic, because Glick is ... relentless ...; fans of this show have to be a little hostile towards celebrity worship to truly get the humor of this.For a great look at what makes the show so original and so excellent, pick up this reasonably priced collection. I'll get it as soon as possible, but I'll also be hoping for season sets.",0.8823529411764706,328,0.10008679670059403,0.0,0.0849073621777954,0.058252217409205234,0.0,0.32944141152398154,0.08182765306627678,0.15414231977669746,0.09129392315590759,0.12997293991658015,0.061547730382895585,0.0,0.0601654903525025,0.0711903255273149,0.09541969566941666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883074660957637,0.0561259409833254,0.0,0.05692919774741832,0.13818933189991597,0.04629290384209363,0.16981288856763163,0.1390949780428777,0.04787701467471473,0.11328605384508295,0.04906219137290014,0.12175821116971011,0.1514422556599616,0.06095573280617194,0.0,0.0,0.060837688956203534,0.047333148311359714,0.12416943651806689,0.11896821730511017,0.11420873306236796,0.13885434758773535,0.0,0.0488270819181787,0.0928907500470725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03696464889336434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056837730840955454,0.0,0.24901010282669117,0.15282423784743474,0.04080195364947122,0.0,0.0,0.05816884143855704,0.0990433164173101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3966010175620072,0.09141827096121789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124559480106529,0.05766169215327678,0.1214718086486433,0.06231553964488222,0.0,0.04798918346052007,0.2145588695470591,0.051869389095768756,0.11061722777662213,0.0,0.0,0.05234052195249175,0.0,0.07405920908032533,0.058773616622402054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05878074959999208,0.050014871153615324,0.258213750751153,0.0,0.19363389442347237,0.0,0.03638111084779429,0.0,0.0,

It re-releases some great films such as Connery's debut in Dr.No but the first one picks better Connery outings with two of his best, Goldfinger and  Thunderball. George Lazenby's On Her Majesty's Secret Service is an  excellent choice however and is better than Tomorrow Never Dies. They made  a mistake in the Moore section, however. They should have put two Moore  films out and two Connery films like last time but instead put or three  Moore films and one Connery. The Moore film choices were weak with the  exception of his best, The Spy who Loved Me. They should have put out  Octopussy and A View To a Kill instead of Moonraker and The Man with the  Golden Gun. As for Brosnan, GoldenEye is excellent but in my opinion isn't  as good as The World is Not Enough. Overall, weaker than the first set but  still good.

There was no other service to use in New York. . . The cop is dirty, obviously, so why not just report him to Internal Affairs?&#34; Those loose ends grated on my nerves.

I love this film and watch it several times a year. Although my DVD collection exceeds 1,000 I still own just over 350 Laserdiscs. My Popeye Laserdisc is 'pan & scan' and I can tell that there are places that would significantly improve with a letterbox copy of this film. I'm glad to see that my new (already pre-ordered) DVD copy will be letterboxed.I am a Robin Williams fan, but still, he honestly made Popeye come to life. I love his mumbling. I heard that they had to edit out some of that improve mumbling he was doing. I think the Shelly was outstanding as Olive. Great Casting! Great Make-Up! It was the first time I ever saw a resemblance between Ray Walston and Robin Williams. When I first saw this movie over 2 decades ago, I came home talking about how cute the baby was who was cast as Sweetpea. I think the entire village was built from scratch and also looks charming.I love this movie and recomend it to any fans of Popeye, Robin Williams (or Shelly Duval). You won't be dissapointed!",0.8,206,0.07900192680768728,0.0,0.0,0.09196092927050795,0.0,0.20003027478774715,0.06458936114945575,0.12166979727999931,0.0,0.20518416064381165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05619295523613237,0.0,0.08003903184398962,0.0,0.0,0.185748469964321,0.0,0.2242495397231455,0.17974464012934901,0.0,0.07308114000268887,0.0,0.0,0.1511638511288246,0.08942055125386827,0.0,0.0,0.23907708891972845,0.0,0.0,0.07741706166388988,0.09604253125304209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04507442673574114,0.1315229744583123,0.0,0.15416353321696466,0.0,0.2731502353229257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11670983916415402,0.0,0.0,0.23337574531821437,0.0,0.0,0.17471304744276958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017869382992417,0.0,0.0781782721830731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596113566880965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08081436095394436,0.0,0.0,0.2692148428996179,0.1517736312517887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673568425904356,0.07575900287127846,0.21169830420544722,0.08188456052123916,0.2619418670762426,0.0,0.0,0.08262832302919253,0.0,0.3507447780171195,0.09278404568219177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895689182647957,0.08152677280143153,0.0,0.07642092293398284,0.08435050033214983,0.05743370656526852,0.0858599301222921,0.0630178188717195,

1686466,B00H9HZGQ0,A11J6CFP5DCBTE,1,2,1401753600,THE NEAR FUTURE looks profoundly disturbing,"I saw a trailer of this film sometime in 2013, and I automatically knew that I would like this movie.  I waited for this movie to come-out to DVD, and once I finally saw it---it left me satisfied that my own intuition about this film was correct.After seeing Her (2013) by Spike Jones, it took me few days to analyze the depth of the film.  Even though the message behind it is quite simple, it should make viewers of this film think more about what the future holds, or rather where our society is heading in terms of human relations.  Her is a film about loneliness, not of one man, but of mankind.  The type of loneliness, where technology, or Operating System (OS) replaces our need to communicate or even co-exist with the living and breathing surrounding. Theodore played wonderfully and very convincingly by (Phoenix) is a young men,heading towards his middle age, who is separated from his wife and working for a company that deals with writing letters and event-whishes for others.  Yes, it might sound strange, but our main protagonist writes love letters and anniversary wishes for clients for a living, and he is really good at it.  To make the story short, Theodore suffers from his recent break up with his wife and tries to cope with loneliness (loneliness is the major subject of this film).  One day he buys an OS, a really sophisticated artificial intelligence, and he installs it on to his phone.  The OS is so intriguing, funny, intelligent, and perfect, that it almost seems human.  Theodore slowly falls in love with his OS, and the OS (Scarlett Johansson's voice) develops feelings for Theodore.  What is interesting is that, Theodore has a human female co-worker friend that he likes, but their relationship is platonic for she too is dating an OS.  There are some quirky and funny moments in the movie...but overall the movie is pretty sad.  The music by Arcade Fire together with the classical music played throughout the movie make the film dismal and almost gloomy. The ending is heartbreaking, and so is the future we find ourselves be living in...Theodore's character is near similar to Tom Hansen from 500 Days of Summer (2009) and Winston Smith from the novel 1984 by George Orwell.  In that, all three characters are lonely, anti-social misfits, characterized by their longing to be recognized and loved.  Even their professions are alike, all three men Theodore, Tom and Winston work in a cubical like environment. Separated from others, dealing with others' emotions while suppressing theirs. Below I a attach a link from You Tube where the movie is being discussed by a group of filmmakers and artists.[...]",0.5,450,0.10875737942268428,0.045643774970503745,0.061508627235310843,0.0,0.06670249122527054,0.34880212676109174,0.08891643458646148,0.0,0.03306759122069593,0.06277003475282507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314345148188281,0.20737192893404327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04261819435169993,0.1219763337463767,0.24010883565017482,0.0,0.17518755500114908,0.20121314993399256,0.0,0.033587747616152415,0.0,0.0,0.03554165343382186,0.0,0.146277150565698,0.0883151555027472,0.0,0.21315117464577438,0.0,0.0,0.15741403254793332,0.0,0.35162433960110123,0.18106006541818703,0.0,0.0,0.06729195645354775,0.08356224822697834,0.0,0.0825953855231358,0.036380505806298445,0.0,0.160667679552105,0.0,0.0,0.03569720878582004,0.0,0.028999775216089676,0.20043111561360266,0.027677249761318683,0.0591155370541961,0.0,0.11037736646225438,0.0,0.035874500593391576,0.0,0.0,0.07980130328768362,0.0,0.0,0.04694783389201853,0.0,0.06622526253112948,0.03708415086493249,0.03875528628133072,0.0,0.17295249537147708,0.3482299539476378,0.1253139222834318,0.0,0.0,0.03521252483092618,0.0,0.11657312029696135,0.0,0.18030010263955495,0.044668908781705104,0.0,0.03791654305943497,0.03664332328704866,0.02682500178915554,0.0,0.0,0.043846290869382666,0.0,0.0,0.07246358824734138,0.0,0.0,0.03506808693242383,0.0,0.18448653799895065,0.039399465198050744,0.02891766110171504,

Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say, 'This s$!t is out.' ""When viewing the same problems, what makes one person call for violence and another person call for understanding?  There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.'Bring on the Night' is a movie about the launching of 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles' album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, ""If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"" is a response to his earlier ""Every Breath You Take"".Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.  In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, ""I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think.""  Good protest songs are made to be sung.Some of the lyrcis from the movie include:  ""One world is enough for all of us.""  ""Love is the seventh wave.""  ""I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.""Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  ""If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.""This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.  If you are a fan of acapella or minimal accompaniment, the film has amazing, open versions of both 'Roxanne' and 'Message in a Bottle.'",0.75,384,0.16043513901047599,0.0,0.03402577788246516,0.0,0.11069686900776107,0.2843515388428129,0.16395807598205406,0.0,0.03658512844642478,0.10417071667052873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028528812362590115,0.038238490599453154,0.0,0.0,0.1473674968145517,0.0,0.0,0.11385009053670739,0.0,0.2215119816397944,0.03710283827607407,0.0,0.07432123208260544,0.0,0.0,0.07864473389648499,0.06505785038132272,0.16183725952417444,0.0,0.0,0.1965207930950774,0.0,0.11380972035482381,0.09951932455297721,0.0,0.25172405384639085,0.04451559504714382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23112778038869314,0.15040293618394518,0.13707210036611353,0.04025045153686038,0.04817273163385583,0.08887928446877467,0.0,0.0,0.03949446937007903,0.04555430660742979,0.09625380579889951,0.2217518070924534,0.0918641818332282,0.06540390262697918,0.0,0.12211866605730617,0.046621165178212985,0.07938124088936595,0.05156787979401747,0.0,0.0,0.04364193162052698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04102894624725546,0.0,0.0,0.10934295526594903,0.500854409435222,0.0,0.04867861483442641,0.04994466100931857,0.03895822756681713,0.07692474505423029,0.10747790666599953,0.04157227988254087,0.19947937453161932,0.04942052641310957,0.0,0.04194988346189645,0.0,0.02967848881044611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12025776232191615,0.041390633292125084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08747620218601874,0.0,0.12797501199473954,

While there is a lot that the fans have seen, I have personally found tons of killer video that I had never uncovered.Nevermind the quality of some of the clips.  For the most part, the video is well put together and I'll take the archival of the history over perfect quality any day.The Cadillac, Michigan documentary is FANTASTIC!  I think this is the gem of this volume.  The Acrobat live video is cool as well even though it's grainy.The concerts are cool.  Nothing polished live, thank you, it's just the way they performed.  Nothing wrong with honesty.I fell away from the Kiss Army for several years but I am so glad to have these videos as my definitive KISS collection.LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!",0.0,147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08557468578791243,0.1381594434010457,0.13012848534006913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060099583587144234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947641594991795,0.0,0.0,0.1166608136969965,0.0781618632403091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09563721772430953,0.0,0.20557899505059765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10482507803848817,0.0,0.24104038182934107,0.23444445316057919,0.0,0.08244062010734847,0.0,0.38952012948134523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10148200614360015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832001393177334,0.0,0.0,0.28028908662379143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11430727314106912,0.0,0.0,0.07717621708188221,0.0864327106624605,0.0,0.0,0.11517244384642616,0.6087194559850329,0.09735715244095594,0.0,0.0,0.08207047753341322,0.08102589561998053,0.09056636993294147,0.0,0.04669208405563827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10503078775701945,0.0,0.17824422326661676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06142659402649429,0.0,0.0673989231718701,

Sorryfolks no other Beach Boys are involved in this preformance!Mike Love and Brian have been fighting for years over the Dr. Landy episode and other hurtful Jelosey episodes etc..  Al Jardine's mad about not being aloud to use the Beach Boy's name after he was kick out of the band and Bruce Johnson went surfingBrain's brothers Carl and Denny are both in Rock n Roll heaven now.Brian Wison was only 23 years old in 1966 and Pet Sounds was his10th Beach Boys album (Amazing) and yes we all know he is a CrazyGenius but some how he just looks like a normal aging Rocker onstage now! I GUESS THATS WHY HE LAID IN BED FOR TEN YEARS so he could think up and plan this concert which is very well preformed by all ( Remember this is the album most respected by all the Royality of Rock: Paul McCartney - Linsey Buckingham etc..etc... )  so they had their hands full,I like it (I saw the Beach Boys Live 4 times) and this is the best performace seen so far by me of their material.I know that the other Beach Boys did not actually play the instruments on the backing track of the album (Spectors Wrecking Crew Did). Mike, Carl, Al, Bruce and Denny were on a heavy concert tour in 1966, but they put the ecellent vocals on top after they got back! Wouldn't it have been nice if the other boys were there too  oh well that's a common problem in Rock (ego) what a shame Mike, Bruce and Carl was not involved in thisMike Love still sings and sounds the same you know and Al's Guitar still works you know. It's like Robert Plant and Jimmy Page deal ( Not even asking John Paul Jones )to play Led Zepplin songs on a show what a waste ( I'm still crying about that )That's only thing wrong with this DVD lack of participationby the surviving members of the Beach Boys. What a shamecan't we just all get along in this world",0.6666666666666666,406,0.08980070861868572,0.1130638681662132,0.15236258011770634,0.0,0.0,0.2955841647294724,0.07341808782168781,0.0,0.04095574672304247,0.0,0.0,0.10560773818293474,0.05398218192763239,0.09581096443128315,0.17122650678742515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15835383611817436,0.050357783827077375,0.0,0.051078488545343866,0.06199369116227073,0.0,0.05078697766558563,0.0,0.0,0.05082172797644675,0.0,0.0728299436331056,0.22646380144358588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054585297552617575,0.08493728243154418,0.22281667024396112,0.0,0.12808913734799965,0.07475043194037954,0.0,0.08761808151682089,0.1666884235150832,0.15524358507780528,0.0,0.051149109522383995,0.0,0.05392765529421281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05099642184637561,0.1795878388674385,0.14894594441490366,0.13711823442470866,0.0,0.10122831219588663,0.0,0.20876292789493936,0.04443223427774249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059306944222458545,0.1230345927281085,0.09186088458192251,0.0,0.0,0.12240553940869921,0.4528639109233505,0.10347140654339738,0.0,0.0,0.0436123465670417,0.12917176359470514,0.1925082944095832,0.04653868492117222,0.07443668221412073,0.0553245170550315,0.0,0.04696139866346366,0.04538445687255428,0.16612004965668828,0.0,0.0,0.1086113331694617,0.09471918614719861,0.10547950661279355,0.134624276701632,0.0,0.051166805112305466,0.04343345352494529,0.04794018961465812,0.032642163024161314,0.0,0.14326346252440375,

1356002,B003O2H7MA,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,1,1,1404432000,Great collection except for Pal Joey,"If it were not for Pal Joey,I'd give this collection 5 stars.  I consider that movie to be a total waste of time as Frank Sinatra simply plays himself, Rita Hayworth ditto and Kim Novak was wasted on the role.  PICNIC is well done but there are touches of definite Stage Play  in it.  Most of the dialogue for stage plays does not transfer well to the screen as it usually seems artificial.  What fits on the stage does not fit well in a movie.  And, one is always conscious that there is no way that this story can end well for Madge.  Holden is too old for the role and is trying to hard to fit it.  He does a good job and one can imagine that the way he has lived his life simply aged him beyond his years.  He certainly conveys well the fact that he is a supreme egotist who is using his charm on a very young girl in order to boost his own ego and isn't even aware of that fact.  I imagine if their story had been continued, it would wind up like the book Show Boat where the man abandons her when he can't take care of her.  One knows at the end as she boards the bus smiling that she will wind up getting off that bus a year or so later much wiser.  Rosalind Russell, as usual, chews the scenery way too much, no subtlety there.  JEANNE EAGELS is certainly worth seeing and Novak does a great job.  The last part where she does nothing but drink and destroy herself gets tiresome.  It is never fully explained why she is so self destructive except that the old actress whose play she stole committed suicide.  BELL,BOOK AND CANDLE is a charmer and beautifully photographed. It's not meant to be anything but entertainment and it is certainly that. It's delightful beginning to end.  My favorite is MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.  It's another story that at the end you are saying to yourself This Can't End Well.  If you look ahead in their story, what on earth is she going to do in a new life married to this man nearly 3 times her age.  She is simply too inexperienced and immature to deal with what is coming in that life.  But, it's a wonderful story, well told, well acted and they didn't sugar coat it by casting someone buff and handsome in the Fredric March role.  He looks and acts 56. I do want to add that all of these movies are very well restored and look wonderful.",1.0,436,0.0,0.0,0.02866560145490805,0.0,0.0,0.256668044667513,0.08287757965710761,0.10408007486562405,0.06164354066169855,0.05850694058417374,0.0,0.039738226157204244,0.0,0.09613835345575504,0.032214673696734246,0.13693568350941787,0.08022051028290694,0.0,0.0,0.03789739344724206,0.0,0.0,0.09330828827936287,0.0,0.0,0.0313065997473581,0.0323275481964052,0.038246540542884164,0.03312780395780045,0.0,0.2045138717224707,0.12347570562995608,0.04419250161112881,0.13244985615142202,0.0,0.09588095521740218,0.1467230898574996,0.0,0.30846437252688425,0.2250175694246999,0.0,0.0,0.03136087556366481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04058394581838453,0.04991858731302787,0.04098378845147191,0.07645820159739078,0.03327279460138932,0.07675601729218477,0.10812089763552604,0.13077303514361766,0.1031900787498563,0.08265096301884019,0.0,0.03429365644968593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.306315250138786,0.04463219841186951,0.061727502865620364,0.0,0.18061589743523357,0.0,0.2993830196107029,0.2758926119708415,0.07786872865136266,0.0,0.0,0.09846308542990023,0.032403286875056975,0.07243728794886581,0.03502328178363076,0.22407310396841018,0.12490551593649428,0.0,0.07068280081956733,0.06830930544500094,0.025003153049518455,0.0,0.12600944625281052,0.0,0.32076960029399976,0.039689975004188,0.10131321900962674,0.034870250491165135,0.0,0.03268640023277379,0.0360780020423613,0.02456527672749758,0.036723608302396696,0.053907374325140645,

Same director, same locations. Same basic story.  And with this version, I get Sarah Michelle Gellar--though a sadder, more chastened Sarah Michelle Gellar I've never seen.  Her character was badly in need of a Prozac through the whole film.  It was like Angel had just gone bad again.Some people have complained about the disjointed storytelling.  For the most part, this worked fine for me.  It added a level of drama and mystery to the whole thing that we wouldn't have had if the story had been chronological.  We're not only interested in what is happening, but in why.Unfortunately, the pay-off is not so grand.  The forces that called these onryou--these vengeful spirits--into being are slightly questionable, and the way they function--especially outside the confines of the house--is never clear.That said, the movie had some creepy atmospherics and a deft hand with the jump scenes.  It didn't haunt me like the best horror movies do.  I watched it at night...in the dark...alone.  And I slept just fine afterwards.  But I had some spine-tingling moments while watching it.

Well, that's the hard part, because there really isn't anything else out there like it. The writing is incredibly smart...mixing comedy, horror and even a bit of drama all together so well. it's a movie that can't be classified, as anything other then just a GREAT film. There are moments that make you laugh out loud, followed by, and sometimes mixed with scenes that are genuinely creepy and unsettling. And towards the end, there are some truly touchingly sad moments. I give immense credit to star/co-writer Simon Pegg & director/co-writer Edgar Wright. I just wish there were more movies like ""Shaun Of The Dead"" being made these days; ones that are as entertaining and intelligent.

Surprising then that one of the best animated films of the past 30 years was a non-CGI release from Warner Brothers.  Starring Vin Diesel as the voice of the title character, this movie takes place at the height of the Cold War somewhere along the eastern seaboard.  An alien robot crash lands on Earth, and befriends a boy named Hogarth.  The movie features both comedy and tragedy, and includes some subtle commentary on politics, pop psychology and other features of American society.  This movie was directed by Brad Bird, later of Pixar fame, and bears a strong resemblance to Pixar movies in the avoidance of slapstick comedy and pop culture references.  There are some scary scenes so I would say this movie is not appropriate for those under 5 years old.  But overall, a good movie.",0.0,157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08922277148378195,0.34378522986212845,0.07929109871341561,0.0746820508430666,0.0884639263333991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11660087161041674,0.06898351495251259,0.09246180508684176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06695281818691755,0.0897157640657509,0.0,0.08985547241676517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12032034011984666,0.0,0.05533420297321498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3581879125796932,0.23526142745965511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07758151966012175,0.4289619604458044,0.14808687863928754,0.15814857756704995,0.0,0.0,0.11273136099391512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858441951310292,0.1984184193131564,0.0,0.0,0.13219725542153096,0.41922028594032895,0.0,0.0,0.12076767254610307,0.09420215043381931,0.0,0.15593086078720172,0.0,0.16078234921273682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14352693344557518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10008377966498876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1054032440280762,0.0,

It also portrays a powerful if subtle evolution in their complicated relationship.""In Divine Proportion"" features the return to duty of Havers, who was shot and badly injured at the close of Set 3.  She rejoins a partner still mourning the death of his child and his marriage.  Their case is the brutal shotgun murder of a woman who has returned to her rural village after years away at university and at work.  As the detectives dig into the murder, they begin to peel away the complicated history of the village, which hides a brutal secret and holds a deadly threat for the still shaky Havers.""In the Guise of Death"" has Lynley returning to his native Cornwall, where he becomes involved in an apparent suicide that is soon shown to be a murder.  He and Havers work with the local police to unravel the connections between the murder and a smuggling ring run by an unlikely suspect, while Lynley wrestles with a family matter.""The Seed of Cunning"" brings our detectives back to London, where a classified document missing from the House of Lords leaves behind it a trail of bodies.  Lynley and Havers soon discover they are not the only ones following the clues.  Their competition is powerful, ruthless, and perhaps beyond the reach of the law.""The Word of God"" presents Havers and a Lynley cranky over a possible divorce with a body frozen inside a meat transport.  The body has a missing kidney, a false passport and a priceless page from a ancient Koran.  The clues lead to multiple suspects and additional murders.  At the end, Lynley must weigh procedure, and his career, against the life of a pregnant woman.  This last episode may be most notable, however, for a frank late night conversation between Lynley and Havers that is a remarkably honest statement of their nuanced relationship.""Inspector Lynley Mysteries 4"" is very highly recommended to fans of this excellent series for its offering of tough and complicated crime mysteries and for the further exploration of a remarkable partnership that fans have come to treasure.",0.0,377,0.0,0.05386263506899723,0.0,0.04979768892195745,0.07871329541391973,0.34661834682606857,0.03497573306080181,0.032942657083882484,0.15608766800573542,0.07407273998140072,0.0,0.0,0.05143327594491701,0.0,0.040785402970965556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14766625349951282,0.07914821880955139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125824415918173,0.03469554632819344,0.08630829488735865,0.05210882529961912,0.0,0.20961025429887395,0.0,0.040463376333782136,0.13268488412005758,0.0508507876648102,0.12204108302991278,0.04748060014994535,0.05470511428163572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05138132392514175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03422162848179403,0.4020870682664781,0.0,0.0,0.04822428001881248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157497619814509,0.055401509753297815,0.0,0.0,0.043761719668723796,0.0,0.0,0.08746938796444874,0.5958544240799473,0.19717148196379555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08204839355035734,0.04585463144731246,0.0,0.26004720496249195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0864830286802988,0.03165525382219578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0487508343047152,0.08276526515300928,0.0,0.09330264088869279,0.0,0.0,
1283527,B002Q5O6ZM,A8V90JHLB3Z3Y,0,0,1402531200,1930's Gives an Insight for the current generation to hopefully avoid a repeat of history.,"I grew up hearing my parents talk about the Great Depression from their perspective.  For my parents, who lived in Chicago at the time, their perspective was different from those who lived in agricultural areas.  The 1930's American Experience gave me a broader perspective of that era.  It is clear that the actions taken by the U.S. Government under Roosevelt was perhaps the most important aspect of the recovery.  Sadly that recovery was also aided by the onset of WWII.  In the episode describing the stock market crash  a scenario that is reminiscent of our recent market fluctuations is described.  In watching the series it is clear that the recovery only occurred when the employment rates rose significantly.  In the current era of global competition, out-sourcing and cheap labor the ability of the U.S. economy to rebound from a downturn may be more difficult.  Everyone should see this series no matter what your political convictions may be.",0.0,157,0.08022485115131725,0.0,0.0,0.09338445479212594,0.0,0.04062533578369031,0.0,0.0,0.07317689882824487,0.13890689684339896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15296784659584392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055383022275828996,0.2226372374292699,0.0,0.0,0.07675190939197327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24882089572724153,0.0,0.18308865728849158,0.08903927178537203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913896952724455,0.08050821043903811,0.09635420890247952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15799221771773866,0.09111688348133978,0.0,0.26612632359098415,0.0,0.0,0.09043387745076496,0.0,0.0,0.07938844661879721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08729178632080409,0.21706285269375206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2733822018280893,0.6164921524260785,0.18487556091810667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04299506513356509,0.08315210710491465,0.04433277378083075,0.0,0.0,0.08390738281657849,0.0,0.17808709702120337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801791190431272,0.08278878094661464,0.0,0.15520778834038507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

In fact, only in its latest incarnation did I discover it. But having done that and loved it, I decided to watch the past episodes... and that's where I met Sarah Jane. She's smart and funny and fearless... everything I wish I could be.But this series is something the new Doctor Who isn't. It's a tween show. When Doctor Who first came out, it was intended for the younger audience. As it went on, it went beyond that. This series you can tell is really focused on the kids... In fact, three of the main characters are children. It's really fun and still has that hint of Doctor Who danger.

575671,B00005A0Q0,AO37T54VEP0JQ,2,4,1101945600,'They Came From Beyond Space' - but they were very polite!,"Let's talk about that title first of all.  Specifically the two words ""Beyond Space"".  Hmmmmm...is it possible to travel from a position beyond space?  Well that's too serious a question to consider here but the silly title is an immediate tip-off that you're in for a cheesy sci-fi treat.  Actually the aliens in this film come from the planet Zarn and without a doubt they are the most polite alien invasion force ever depicted in any science fiction film I can recall.  They are ""bodiless mental intelligences representing the highest form of evolution"" - with the good manners to match too!  The actors portraying the aliens suffer from too restrained direction to be effectively frightening and produce mainly fits of unintentional giddy laughter.  All is not lost though as there is an above average quality to the production design and efficient use of sets and location.Meteorites crash to the earth's surface on a remote farm outside Cornwall, England and an investigation of the site reveals they landed in a perfect V-like formation.  Because this suggests an intelligent design scientist and extraterrestrial investigator Dr. Curtis Temple is asked to head up a team of fellow scientists to examine and analyze the meteorites.  Dr. Temple though is forbidden to participate by his physician who recently placed a silver plate in Temple's head after a car crash.  The rest of the investigating scientists come under the power of alien beings when they first approach the meteorites; soon these aliens construct a barrier around the region of the crash denying entry to inquiring officials.  The aliens selectively take over many of these unsuspecting officials, enabling them to effectively carry out their mission.  The Zarns have come to earth from the moon where they crash landed earlier.  They need to inhabit the bodies and minds of earthlings in order to rebuild their spaceship so they can return to Zarn.  Dr. Temple soon discovers that the plate in his head renders him free of the aliens influence and he quickly becomes a one-man-fighting force.  He successfully breaks into the aliens' compound, uncovers their plans, recaptures his girlfriend and escapes with her.  He enlists the aid of a scientist friend and the two of them devise a way to defeat the aliens - but not before an unscheduled trip to the moon where they will have to affect a mutiny if they are to succeed.Derivative of other films from the genre, this unpretentious and modest sci-fi thriller was created by Amicus Productions known for their science fiction and horror cheapies during the sixties. A cult following inevitably developed and is still existent today adding new 'members' frequently.  Most of the Amicus films possessed a sort of nave charm that went a long way in making their films watchable, a trait that is immediately apparent in many of these genre films produced in the sixties.  The set design of the aliens fortress looks as if it were borrowed from one of the Irwin Allen television series 'Lost In Space' or 'The Time Tunnel'; the location shooting in the English countryside is derivative of a Hammer Studio production; the cast is made-up of familiar faces from previous low-budget features.  All of these elements come together to create a typical B-movie that defies the odds and becomes a respectable entry in the genre, albeit a minor one.  What works well here is the 'fish-out-of-water' twist by having American scientist Dr. Temple be the hero, a sort of foreign-born  junior-grade Quatermass in training (if you are familiar with those films).  The understated screenplay based on pulp writer Joseph Milliard's novel ""The Gods Hate Kansas"" keeps the proceedings on track, being presented as a straightforward scientific suspense story.  In addition the actors are all adequate and give sincere performances; there is no attempt at any self conscious humor.  What doesn't work so well here is the portrayal of the aliens as I previously stated.  Because they have inconveniently decided to land in the English countryside they are forced to takeover the minds of several unemotional British officials and farmers.  It's difficult for us to tell if they are possessed or just 'brought up properly' and displaying the most polite of manners!  It really doesn't hurt the impact of the film at all; it's just that it is so glaring and obvious - and you will chuckle...you'll see.Worth noting: Robert Hutton is a veteran of several of these sci-fi and/or horror cheapies, most notably the dreadful 'The Slime People' a perennial participant at Worst Films Of All Time Festivals and directed by Hutton.  Michael Gough, seen here as The Master Of The Moon, is probably more familiar to contemporary film audiences as Alfred the butler in the 'Batman' films of the 80's & 90's. And don't you just love that vintage car that Hutton drives around in during the film?",0.5,807,0.02007158954431342,0.02527119873586816,0.10216486764110551,0.0,0.09232649539946183,0.2337747745829914,0.11486907203592492,0.09273594947457682,0.05492475173195124,0.03475334859838142,0.049371578364130676,0.0,0.0,0.028553276568233733,0.07654256221823771,0.04067016235205215,0.0,0.024582311385383426,0.0,0.0,0.09495643331545957,0.04566674238527012,0.0415691126212487,0.12997129226919313,0.0,0.018596241122617253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048835229397120955,0.06074101470875997,0.024448348625210056,0.026250516581301803,0.059006794450481646,0.0,0.07593821011878465,0.22411049622013482,0.02385810421838272,0.18322902824126866,0.06683065250802438,0.0,0.05875123468123346,0.01862848116705873,0.023132597852878807,0.05017730355021691,0.0,0.020142483677927637,0.09642808203207712,0.01482591679813177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022796685310701944,0.032112115321526316,0.37730134065176657,0.045971478890552295,0.049094991143028156,0.0,0.06111169300987803,0.0233305720257113,0.039724656193817584,0.025806050302444684,0.0,0.022091452734437196,0.021839677861369575,0.027153658885381564,0.0,0.0,0.054999562541904246,0.0,0.021457308084484334,0.0,0.13679589965120081,0.616964806451168,0.11563581366214913,0.04872035802473592,0.0,0.038991635269829523,0.2309721301284719,0.032271021537860586,0.041607929204047656,0.2662005777769895,0.07419435871811576,0.050703263688381725,0.06297878488258014,0.0,0.014851969446914639,0.0,0.04990006505880579,0.0,0.06351279368153206,0.02357599839282505,0.0401202955035179,0.020713063423455667,0.0,0.01941584793827151,0.042860945015828204,0.043775607663069184,0.0,0.08005297120474562,
1037132,B000L212HC,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,3,5,1300579200,Engaging yet bitter.....,"I have a very mixed opinion of Christopher Nolan's movies. I loved his first indie-film 'Following' as well as 'Batman Begins' but 'The Prestige' marked a turning point in Nolan's career. While there's clever writing and plot-twists abound, gone is the fun and sense of wonder both from the world of magic as well as Nolan's filmmaking.The Prestige concerns two rival magicians: Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) who used to be friends and worked together as ringers for another magician until a personal tragedy sparks a feud between them. What follows is a series of elaborate illusions, sabotages, seductions, and finally murder as each magician tries to ruin the other while seeking to discover the secrets behind the other's illusions. This sounds like a promising story and at first it's quite engaging with great period detail (of turn-of-the-century England and America) and some clever behind-the-scenes insights to the magic tricks of it's era. However as the movie goes on, the plot (adapted by Christopher and Jonathon Nolan from Christopher Priest's novel) starts getting twisted and bizarre as illusions are revealed and the film's credibility starts to crumble. Some people thought the big reveal at the end was clever. I thought both magicians' ""reveals"" unconvincing (even in a movie sense) and the experience as a whole feels fake.The one thing Christopher Nolan excells at in all his films is his casting. Both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are well cast and convincing as the two (unlikeable) magicians. Michael Caine is a welcome presence as Cutter, an engineer who knew both men but works mostly for Angier. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as Olivia, Angier's assistant who falls for Borden. Surprisingly, David Bowie and Andy Serkis give the best performances in the movie as Nikola Tesla and his assistant Mr. Alley.As usual I'm in the minority with my low opinion of 'The Prestige'. I like the idea of using stage magic as a movie theme and this film started out really strong. However, too much revealed too early, no one to relate to and an unconvincing finale make for a bitter movie experience.",0.6,354,0.0,0.0,0.0365068477459577,0.0,0.0791790615687515,0.39225304556064994,0.07036538635234701,0.497063804742267,0.11775845818192691,0.03725552340752509,0.0,0.0,0.0517376194365888,0.0612181160349488,0.04102674034878916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048263922692270575,0.12215173846852707,0.09790932146084398,0.11883202517166779,0.07961655851433508,0.0,0.0,0.04117049076617953,0.0,0.0,0.03490084850895072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16868045626393338,0.0,0.0,0.13347001359476596,0.0,0.12276323048512267,0.047761554675412134,0.0,0.0,0.07987878511348048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589335452804517,0.052194576395125696,0.048686365939964865,0.04237430177441709,0.048876006339509656,0.0,0.2141292269111762,0.032854225121878515,0.07017298247941142,0.0,0.0,0.10004131483955116,0.042584755667359905,0.055328073401437604,0.0,0.04736399038637619,0.0,0.05821734106228826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804133730606249,0.046004386676063456,0.0,0.0,0.47537053752868175,0.0,0.05222813087133961,0.0,0.041798958635038394,0.0,0.04612596471138344,0.0,0.16646379844220385,0.10604828136600764,0.10870760392098724,0.0,0.04349738514008737,0.03184256583569306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13617118735947253,0.0,0.04300888025270025,0.0,0.0,0.12488251173153034,0.0,0.06256982388726572,0.0,0.0,

JMS decided to experiment with some strange and boring music that really didn't fit the show. Ratings had started well and then dropped badly because it is hard to concentrate on the show with such dreadful music.To answer reviewer ""star fire rain"" who disagrees with me about the reasons for cancellation,this show was cancelled due to TNT executives feeling that JMS had not given them what he had promised and a big factor in that is the very lame music. It just doesn't work. Just when they get a dramatic scene,it is ruined by the most lame and lifeless music in the history of television.When the show did air,JMS thought that he could interest someone else(like the Sci-Fi Channel)in taking up the show,but the ratings dropped badly and that chance was gone(again,the lame,flat and very boring music was a factor).Some Crusade fans(like sfr),that think that JMS can do no wrong,may disagree with this but the fact is that the audience was initially there and left. Season one was not the time to experiment and the music was absolutely awful.The special effects vary from reasonable to poor,but the cast are fantastic and the story setup is good. Any fans that blame TNT for the demise of Crusade should remember that they financed the 13 episodes of Crusade,the entire fifth season of Babylon 5,four telemovies and even gave JMS $150,000 to re-edit the B5 pilot. To give such money to re-edit a pilot is unprecedented and shows that he initially had their support.TNT backed Babylon 5 and Crusade to the tune of well over US$40 million and the turning point came when JMS made the mistake of replacing Babylon 5's eccellent composer with a disastrous and musically very different new composer. The result was that Crusade did not match Babylon 5's ratings.JMS then went to the Sci-Fi channel that financed one single episode of his new B5 Rangers show,so by that comparison TNT didn't do so badly. Fans should remember that no-one else wanted Crusade.",0.08571428571428572,355,0.03693890992592445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03398276045659001,0.26187868681129295,0.030200030430657727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04543068903603685,0.0,0.0,0.10509650059507268,0.07043285747341307,0.037423828852179895,0.08769543687436507,0.0,0.0,0.04142866285735576,0.0,0.0,0.05100136533537772,0.0683410584254388,0.04178175478247046,0.034223740689423715,0.0,0.16724137355959998,0.0,0.0,0.11178521094119384,0.0,0.0,0.036197874951752494,0.0,0.0,0.06874058990240084,0.0,0.16860350185709244,0.0614961622205969,0.0,0.07208220226357319,0.06856614782477113,0.0,0.0,0.042079675728648805,0.0,0.04436554749000563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08390812331455226,0.08864668137821873,0.14295843304738792,0.02820132596126408,0.09035235857342308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04065618126001323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3415371065594379,0.06747925576481438,0.15114539711243713,0.03948912809499611,0.0,0.4279808227097444,0.47901210594796134,0.04256225841652166,0.044831449762890996,0.09199487572026635,0.035879283499616804,0.0708452336853056,0.03959348793885393,0.03828674220542734,0.22453949684549387,0.0,0.0,0.0386345030436465,0.18668587255484634,0.19133058310487167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688627648379843,0.0,0.03691785293172737,0.11435835448903325,0.0,0.03573211063049317,0.0,0.134271314590266,0.0,0.0,

If you are a Doctor Who and Sarah Jane Adventures fan like I am that does not mean you will be a Torchwood fan.  I commend it for being a new kind of scifi show like there has never been done before.  It is very original.  I like dark things, but not the way this show is dark.  It has too many atheist and homosexual overtones to the point of being unrealistic.  At times you think that the main point of the show is about atheists and homosexuals.  If you could take those out with some good old Doctor Who style writing the show would have great potential.  Eve Myles who plays Gwen Cooper looks very beautiful as always.  She was also in the 3rd episode of the first season of the new Doctor Who series.

Using martial arts with French swordsmen sounds like a good idea in theory, but to see it played out onscreen was just unforgiveable.  You'd think more time would have been spent on the dialogue than the look of the film.  Granted, it comes across as an attempt to be a trendy action flick, but it falls flat due to the acting.  Justin Chambers had the look to play D'Artagnan, but he left his emotions at the door.  Stephen Rhea was horrible as Richelieu.  His delivery was flat and emotionless.  Thank God for Tim Roth.  He was the only bright spot in this film.  You just want to hate the guy for who he is and how crazily mean he is.  The action sequences are okay at best, but I wasn't amazed by any of it.  The ladder fight sequence was interesting, but it ended kind of unheroically.  It's a shame, since Roth did so well throughout the rest of the film.

He is befriended by an American G.I., who wants to adopt him, but learns that is not possible because of the laws pertaining to adoption.  Also, the G.I. is assigned to another country to assist in helping the country to locate people lost in the bombings and destruction.  In order to not reveal much more, I add that the young actor who plays the abandoned boy is excellent in his facial expressions, etc.  It is also a coming of age story in the sense that the boy realizes that he has to make his own life.

962247,B000CS464G,AAYE34TCTNV2R,0,0,1340582400,Beautiful Film But Not For All Tastes,"In its oblique way, Noah Baumbach's beautifully acted, painful-to-watch ""The Squid and the Whale"" uses its literary ""A Star Is Born"" framework to ask, ""What does it mean to be a man in a changing world?"" Set in 1986, the film chronicles the disintegration of a marriage and its impact on the couple's 17- and 12-year-old sons. No easy answers to the question are forthcoming in this FOR ADULTS ONLY movie.The movie opens with the Berkham family playing doubles tennis. To win a point, Bernard, the father, teamed with elder son Walt, smashes a shot into his wife Joan, who is teamed with younger son Frank. This tennis match is the only thing Bernard can beat his wife at. An insufferably arrogant college writing professor, Bernard spouts constant streams of elitist attitude about culture in general and literature in particular. He published critically successful novels in the past but can't even find an agent for his most recent effort. Meanwhile, Knopf has accepted Joan's novel and the New Yorker is publishing excerpts from it.We learn that Bernard and Joan met at the dawn of the feminist movement, when most men still took their privilege on the top of the work and family heaps for granted. Bernard dazzled Joan and she married him because ""there was nobody like him in Columbus."" The marriage has long been troubled with affairs and other symptoms of discord. The more Joan comes into her own, the more insecure Bernard becomes, and the more condescending he acts. ""Your mother would never have thought of writing if it hadn't been for me,"" Bernard tells his sons, insisting on his share of credit for her success, even though Joan, like Bernard, has a Ph.D in literature.Shortly after the tennis match, Bernard and Joan unsurprisingly tell their sons they will be separating and they will share joint custody.  Bernard gets a house ""on the other side of the park"" because, continuing his competition with Joan, he wants a house ""just like your mother's"" but cheaper. Of course Bernard's new house, dilapidated with peeling paint, minimal furniture, and a poster of a tennis player that tennis-loving Frank does not admire, is nowhere near as nice as the family home Joan keeps.The boys shuttle back and forth miserably under the joint custody arrangement. Both parents and children act out in ways that are all the more disturbing because they are believable, and that are shown graphically. Bernard continues his ""how-dare-she"" rant against Joan to anyone who will listen. Joan dares because she's figured out after almost 20 years of marriage and sea changes in opportunities for women that Bernard is a terminal jerk and she can.If you don't want to venture into this unpleasant soup, I don't blame you, but you will miss a haunting, thought-provoking film. ""The Squid and the Whale offers a career-best performance from Jeff Daniels as the obnoxious yet egg-fragile Bernard and terrific support from Laura Linney as Joan, Jesse Eisenberg as Walt, and Owen Kline as Frank. The script and storytelling are finely wrought and heartfelt. Perhaps, having had to observe and endure the anguish of their parents' divorce, Walt and Frank will be better men than their father.",0.0,533,0.03202800598362539,0.08064992586051391,0.027170551896263648,0.0,0.05892973330433408,0.40546927756607615,0.13092518935702835,0.14797769444774317,0.05842853230387561,0.08318328160327478,0.15756332638990272,0.07533137148845097,0.038506191596523916,0.06834320551148824,0.0,0.09734536970458205,0.0,0.07845142652047336,0.0,0.07184172270106762,0.060608358051500714,0.0,0.13266271560884418,0.08888301654948476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03625179873890489,0.09420008696421953,0.025975272426556766,0.09692374279817847,0.07802390083049818,0.08377529844191031,0.21969842383327093,0.03893640180628665,0.060586866892146596,0.21853978474547778,0.11421031248830145,0.10964117465502078,0.05332045410979959,0.12286708788067655,0.031249557851602473,0.08917576332963299,0.0,0.0,0.03648532424830215,0.1285645237687747,0.07693459408121155,0.04731509189892009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036376410145595284,0.025620467661369124,0.21249015391242185,0.09780821777847105,0.0,0.07220747004322706,0.0,0.07445665414701413,0.0633881797684286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16590824598315335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036284918602181915,0.10914182663239458,0.4922418443511524,0.14761499675812106,0.0,0.0,0.031109253329845248,0.09213989691092059,0.05149450015557588,0.0,0.1415910729452161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023699117863297002,0.037615385983282755,0.03981248168607358,0.03873693740449195,0.0,0.0,0.032009748446045275,0.03305159851944067,0.0,0.06196329319820115,0.17098179997155546,0.13970447343736536,0.034808294769879566,0.0766437666062871,

440039,6304935811,A34PAZQ73SL163,2,3,1187049600,He'll Never Fade Away.,"I've been watching Patton about every other year since I was a child and have to say that the movie never gets old. As far as performances go, George C. Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather. His perspective adds to one's appreciation of the film. Patton also has some great action scenes such as the initial battle in the desert against, who he thought was, Rommel. The German General Staff scenes are speculative but unquestionably entertaining. I find Patton to be a fun and noble flick.",0.6666666666666666,200,0.1326123338179342,0.0,0.056249994144608365,0.15436526605628798,0.0,0.23503904084381488,0.054209727964541786,0.2042344588851932,0.0,0.057403558590172946,0.0,0.07797760644150531,0.0,0.09432528090270725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07794916877483739,0.0,0.12547480811311973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499918140279793,0.0,0.0634357663702881,0.0,0.06500609385717096,0.05377545982418375,0.40131389201709894,0.0,0.08671815104845722,0.2599039704326904,0.0,0.0,0.16452118869162433,0.0,0.11349264188485254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04897717301487449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21995449262486852,0.05062200887875729,0.10812299876024391,0.0,0.0,0.0770721620927511,0.06561487514910973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06056338430948822,0.0678273394406925,0.0,0.0,0.18076120448177693,0.5095332801519415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066067904431856,0.06872555590201616,0.1465648738845172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29437942507737375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06993782413038595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556008793608049,0.06413993526680563,0.07079521449512531,0.0,0.0,0.052890735519892464,

1108643,B000WCBULO,A1U360OMVQRPUB,0,0,1198195200,Have No Fear!,"When I was a kid, one of my favorite cartoon heroes was Underdog.  He was like Superman, only not as serious and certainly not as skilled.  His city had to have been running out of phone booths, because every time he changed from his secret identity of Shoeshine Boy to Underdog, the phone booth blew up.  Super, yeah.  But not so talented.And he talked in rhyme.  Everything was a couplet.  His questions and answers all rhymed and there was never any explanation as to why he had a quirk like that.  Best of all, the character was voiced by Wally Cox, who had the nerd voice down pat and whose underplayed emotions even at critical times were terrifically funny.The cartoon series started in 1964 and ran for 124 episodes.  It was revived again and again as comic books, and even as a radio show, but never as a movie until Walt Disney films produced it and released it in 2007.My son watched the movie in the theater and thought it was great.  He's ten, older than I was when I first discovered Underdog.  The movie is also live-action (with MAJOR CGI effects) which lends itself to the younger crowd.  And it stars a cute beagle as the main character.  If you're a kid, what's not to love?I sat down with my son and popped the DVD into the player.  Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much, but I can be a ten year old kid with the best of them.  When the remix of the show's theme song came on, I have to admit that I got excited and carried away, and even started singing along (the words that I could remember).The movie gave Underdog a police dog background that I wasn't exactly ecstatic about.  But it had him screwing up and immediately drawing sympathy, so it worked.In fact, the story pulls in the origins of so many things that weren't explained in Underdog's original cartoon run.  Never once did the series tell how Underdog got his powers.  It did mention the Underdog Super Energy Vitamin Pill, which gave Underdog a ""lift,"" and that got edited out to some degree once drug awareness started kicking into the kid's cartoon.  But no one mentioned where the pills came from.  The movie takes care of that, but it doesn't give Underdog the nifty little ring he kept his Underdog pill in.The movie explains where the costume came from as well as the name.  It even tells viewers how Underdog got the name Shoeshine, which my son and I found particularly hilarious.Some of the cartoon purists seem to hate the movie, but I thought it was really well done.  It brought the idea of a super-powered dog into the real world (well, as ""real"" as that could be) and paired him up with a kid (Jack played by Alex Neuberger).  Their dialogue and twist on the normal boy/dog relationship is great.Peter Dinklage stars as Simon Bar Sinister, the diminutive mad scientist that constantly plagued Underdog in the cartoon series.  There are moments when he steals the show and he is awesome.  Patrick Warburton, his hair appropriately styled, stars as Cad, Simon's henchman, and is a riot with his deadpan delivery and his thesaurus that only has the P section left.Although UNDERDOG isn't the most stunning film ever made, it's a great family film.  The pacing moves along so that even the little guys will be kept entertained, and the characterization (and Jason Lee's voice portrayal of Underdog) is well done.  It's a goofy little movie well worth watching, and will probably be watched again by the kids.The special features section is well done, and most of the kid will be interested in the behind-the-scenes feature showing how everything was done.  I know my kid loved the sections where they showed how the dogs were put into wire harnesses to ""fly.""This is one for the kids, and one for the grownups who can remember being kids.  There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!",0.0,668,0.023543063810873642,0.0,0.03994491804437842,0.02740492685948183,0.0,0.3218954126074797,0.019248029921432687,0.23567929872455104,0.021474747212004344,0.10191025253466263,0.028955310622112398,0.02768719486970189,0.05661006347595744,0.11722094245199732,0.06733571434040769,0.04770425507850366,0.0,0.0,0.027677097621855933,0.13202306933337146,0.04455183509732943,0.026782508371783243,0.04875868295546732,0.06533589794498314,0.0,0.0,0.0675716467337546,0.10659151386512605,0.02308145210499332,0.0381876721614144,0.18999054453803987,0.0,0.061581329727528084,0.18456611340531992,0.11448507818562098,0.022268018715744825,0.1460396907321404,0.11193789485975095,0.10745966816341938,0.18290842040379665,0.0,0.0,0.043700726327375046,0.027133487667193805,0.0294278501643389,0.0,0.0,0.056552882456799104,0.13912102156633033,0.0,0.02663572750629849,0.1159123641231302,0.05347895499370829,0.07533210844589218,0.15619671281753128,0.03594830589146962,0.07678159597825221,0.0530780803437646,0.0,0.0,0.046595219256116746,0.0,0.0,0.02591227168398858,0.0,0.09555002942231126,0.0,0.09329105707970306,0.08601598842884801,0.04816636083839296,0.025168448783156383,0.02667222412972797,0.17650092167280212,0.5653685343123137,0.027127112517519304,0.028573384667233224,0.0,0.06860312845835266,0.022576652379484946,0.012617481334841604,0.02440210652291701,0.13010049966518222,0.0,0.0,0.07387125707948443,0.0,0.19162754897776058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14899525034127636,0.055307152763552685,0.023529643107365036,0.09718193425995955,0.08048644891251239,0.045547817320970595,0.07541091560841603,0.08557800253737209,0.0,0.018779700582880022,

927607,B000ALM40I,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6,7,1246147200,"Dark, Funny and Swayze Crazy","Picture 'Pulp Fiction' only with a dismembered member and a man getting his face caved in during sex only to have it eaten by a dog, and you might get a sense of the madness that goes down at 11:14. The film is very cleverly written and directed by Greg Marcks. Focusing on a handful of interweaving stories occurring at 11:14, weird things happen and people collide in surprising ways. At the center of it all is a manipulative girl (a sexy Rachael Leigh Cook) who has three men wrapped around her finger. Her religious dad (a creepy and funny Patrick Swayze) goes overboard protecting and following his little girl around. A drunk driver (Henry Thomas) has an accident when something thrown from a bridge smashes through his windshield. Figuring it's a deer, he's horrified to discover it's a mutilated body. A concerned driver (Barbara Hershey) pulls up next to him and calls the cops before taking off. When the officer (Clark Gregg) arrives to administer a sobriety test he already has two people (Hilary Swank and Shawn Hatosy) in his backseat. The driver makes a break for it and so do the other two. On the other side of town, a trio of rowdy teens (Colin Hanks, Ben Foster and Stark Sands) drive around in a van destroying property. What happens to one of them is horrifying and hilarious, involving a retrieval mission like you've never seen. In another part of town, two convenience store employees come up with a plan to rob the store and then rig it to look like an armed robbery.

What's more, she's horribly overindulged by director Jacques Rivette, whose pacing often seems to take her lead and drags scenes out far beyond their natural lifespan just so she can slowly, dreamily roll her eyes up heavenward while smiling like an idiot another three times for no discernible reason. While a certain degree of affectation might have suited the character, this is in the realms of the absurd, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast are excellent and the film has a lot going for it whenever she's offscreen. The ending in particular, where the various characters find themselves on stage as the plots and possibilities are casually resolved, is quietly marvellous.",0.0,175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936140895937664,0.17473617532230845,0.1410548721405162,0.06642780402712437,0.0,0.0,0.10609625125954161,0.0,0.0,0.061359099819004725,0.08224244780328116,0.0873974846792535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08162203390334569,0.0,0.1191056923417938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09764150162952298,0.08457362360659054,0.1399248971468588,0.0,0.21015152640983042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21404382669547828,0.0,0.19687352179579826,0.0957430966730963,0.0,0.08416834088330508,0.16012548789971848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17313945229972433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09797713310968895,0.0,0.2861631481920238,0.0658597751547446,0.07033458909603435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17073130916147436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4468614202343089,0.0,0.07879361095262798,0.088244094295181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45574942116016015,0.19879496256598042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04623219164990158,0.0,0.09534123450865671,0.0,0.0,0.1804496488686238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08621585724795862,0.0,0.09830448282014435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

While some of the courtroom scenes drag, the rest of the script is tight and packed with light humor in appropriate moments.Two marines, Downey and Dawson, are accused of murdering private Santiago during a disciplinary procedure known unofficially as a Code Red.  Assigned to represent them is naval lawyer Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), joined by internal affairs officer Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore).  The chain of command extending downward from Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Jack Nicholson) denies ordering the Code Red, so Dawson and Downey's only hope is if Kaffee can prove they were following orders given to them from above.Kaffee and Weinberg find themselves facing off with prosecutor Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) and hard-core marines such as Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland), Lt. Col. Matthew Andrew Markinson (the late, great J.T. Walsh), Cpl. Carl Hammaker (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and of course, Col. Jessep.Innocence, orders, protocols, procedures, guilt, and morals are strewn over the courtroom in a trial over the loss of one life, and potential loss of two more.  Where is the line between right and wrong drawn?  Kaffee (the carefree one), Joanna (the serious one) and Sam (the stable one) are forced to work as a team to uncover the truth as to what happened to break down the chain of military command the night private Santiago died.The cast is first-rate and the performances stellar in this tense drama.  The scripting does drag at times, but can't distract from the overall plot.  Jack Nicholson, though his screen time is limited, steals the show with his portrayal of Col. Jessep, a war-zone hardened marine of high stature, slated for promotion.  This movie is a must-see for fans of courtroom or military dramas.

1073568,B000Q66Q2O,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,7,7,1287446400,"Two and Three, my Halloween saga recommendations, once you own the original of course!","There have been many sequels to John Carpenter's 1978 classic, ""Halloween"", including an uncalled for remake that spawned its own sequel. But, I don't think I could give a higher recommendation to any of the sequels than I can to this particular pair, except maybe ""H2O"", which wasn't a masterpiece but at least dealt with the original victim character of Laurie Strode. However, before I go into WHY I recommend these two sequels, let me give the customary brief synopses.""Halloween II"", from 1981, picks up right where the original classic film left off. On that same fateful Halloween night in 1978, Michael Myers is still on the loose, Dr. Loomis is still in hot pursuit, and Laurie Strode is still fighting to stay alive, this time from largely from a hospital bed. The movie itself is little more than an extension of the hunt for Michael and an increase to his body count, a story-less plot that is the main reason I don't like slasher film sequels (and many slasher film originals) and tend to lean towards monster-type horror films. However, read on to find out why I feel this one can be one of the more enjoyable Halloween sequels.""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a complete change of tactics from the creators of the film series. Leaving Michael Myers for dead, this 1982 film was meant to turn the Halloween franchise into something that the Myers fans didn't allow. A shame too, because it would have meant completely new horror stories set on the holiday in each new installment. The first and only one in this attempt at turning Halloween into an anthology series, ""Halloween III"" is about a doctor who travels to a strange little town to investigate a mysterious death. While there, he and the daughter of the deceased strike up a romance and uncover a disturbing plot by a mad warlock to exterminate countless children and their families through murderous Halloween masks. Horror films always fit well around Halloween, but this much maligned sequel is one of the few that I consider a must-watch near or on October 31st.So, why do I recommend these two installments of the Halloween franchise above all the other sequels? Let's start with Halloween 2. As a standalone film, this doesn't work. It just doesn't. It is nothing more than an extension of the ending of the original John Carpenter masterpiece. This really is nothing more than a feature-length extension of that film's climax. There's no plot. There are new characters, but they don't amount to much in the long run. What makes this film work is that, with the returning cast, writers, and crew members, you can watch this film right after the original as though it is one long movie, and in that way it works well; especially if you enjoy all the chasing around of slasher films, which I admit gets a little boring for me, but with the superior style and cast of this film compared to the many lame copycats, it is still entertaining. This one also has the big reveal of Laurie's relationship to Michael, which I assume was only cooked up to give this one more importance. Admittedly, even John Carpenter and co-writer Debra Hill didn't want to make this story-less sequel, but they manage to keep it interesting with the great visuals and dialogue, and a classically disturbing scene about the whole razorblades in the candy scare that was prominent at the time. So, basically, this is a great one to directly follow (and I mean immediately) a viewing of the original film. Together, it's like an extended cut version of ""Halloween"". Though, if you don't have the original film handy, then no point viewing this one. Recommended as the ""Halloween"" 1978 companion.As for ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", this is the one that is great as a standalone film. It needs no prior knowledge of the previous 2 films. This is its own story. Why do I love this one? Well, besides the fact that I would have loved the whole idea of making the film franchise an anthology series, this one is just a disturbing little film. I mean, the evil conspiracy plot of the villain is just so wicked, and he and his creations so creepy, that it's just a really fun movie! Granted, it requires an attentive viewer. It has a big Nancy Drew quality of sneaking around in the dark trying to unveil a plot, but it's full of worthwhile stuff, including the crazy death scenes, kind of attractive in a different sort of way female lead, and of course that unforgettable television commercial jingle, ""Eight more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween; Eight more days till Halloween, Silver Shamrock!"" I'm part of a small group of folks who really love this one!So, that's the films in a nutshell. Part 2 brings back Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, while Part 3 stars Tom Atkins, Stacey Nelkin, and Dan O'Herlihy. The double feature DVD release is basically a repackaging of the two films' separate disc releases, so we happily get two separate discs here rather than a double sided, cramped one. The films are in anamorphic widescreen and unfortunately, only ""Halloween 2"" includes bonus features: the trailer and some text stuff. This is definitely a great way to own these two films, just make sure you already have the original 1978 classic first.And, if you want more of the same, there are a total of 8 films in the original Halloween franchise (I'll review all of them here on Amazon this month, if I can), and if you just love Halloween themed films (like Halloween 3), I highly recommend the 2008 release ""Trick `r Treat"" for a really fun, creepshow-style anthology focused on one of my two favorite holidays!",1.0,972,0.03652645888653684,0.0229943771917334,0.046480135881895944,0.021259020114431457,0.1344132683024864,0.2219610959884497,0.04479423616356112,0.0703173806586311,0.049976278200615856,0.015811113962171303,0.02246171041037171,0.02147798589885765,0.0,0.09093264091516508,0.017411605255291975,0.0740119266479264,0.043358125293246834,0.08947022199431573,0.02147015308849628,0.020483040154920463,0.2592038550199404,0.04155237392970255,0.07564784441997707,0.06757797850139809,0.020657614847456512,0.0,0.06989044972065568,0.0,0.03581028017964338,0.0740589908126262,0.036845681331279655,0.0,0.0,0.03579369813177019,0.0,0.08637064791558914,0.13594609781076242,0.0651257884373958,0.2188212015328866,0.13175394000506108,0.04670807622009022,0.1069160244324216,0.05085041595472242,0.06314536393940128,0.06848483067763074,0.04160982412701305,0.14662189066994097,0.0,0.04047050477890042,0.0,0.041324647186423584,0.01798350561590604,0.06222841894850706,0.0,0.343308183856731,0.09760252843613251,0.2233587643322409,0.06176195890519717,0.018535267949122847,0.02122859223518664,0.01807282151273838,0.0,0.0,0.08040444811476381,0.0,0.07412170840078793,0.0,0.0,0.10008869778495144,0.01868221796673171,0.05857230289359835,0.10345317690098596,0.17425968458539082,0.4912066664945696,0.021043509205968102,0.022165436255048045,0.02274192073146485,0.08869665998910463,0.035027096369420654,0.2251205299661383,0.037859241592954986,0.2018475840830606,0.022503260037834764,0.13840538182873613,0.057304679125160435,0.0,0.04054162104519452,0.04289860724773311,0.06810643985552108,0.022088842374684815,0.05779057612890553,0.0,0.018252818504852046,0.0,0.06243632924633223,0.035333134423598755,0.0,0.06638603659200787,0.039697249603128225,0.08740866950272065,

I will say that the performances are nothing short of brilliant. The brutality is honest and true and the depiction of the neighborhood balanced. Yes folks it is true, not everyone who lives in a supposed ghetto deal drugs or commit crimes and I appreciate Spike Lee for showing that.The performances are brilliant especially Kietel. I am a fan of Harvey Kietel and I love his character in this film. Filmed as a typical racist(maybe just ignorant) cop and in the end coming to a realisation that he played a part in the violence.I too believe this to be Spike Lee's best film(I can't believe I just said that). Yes, even better than Do The Right Thing in my opinion. Check this film out, you won't be sorry.BTW, the soundtrack isn't too bad either. A great songs by Seal and Desiree stand out.",1.0,165,0.0896093601168067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722655355688092,0.14652329523671523,0.06900308081309629,0.0,0.15515588951945194,0.11020939660506252,0.0,0.10773431200380613,0.0,0.08543082757514317,0.18157143041252333,0.10636930000417442,0.0,0.0,0.10050096163062826,0.3391454457390807,0.0,0.06186159420989341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573016203402357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09039249978816613,0.0,0.0,0.08781169824771295,0.0,0.0,0.2779273620309197,0.10651420745174932,0.15337944404522896,0.049727435174073374,0.0,0.17486276756953806,0.0,0.10327519337018173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882368825242084,0.0,0.07168206831865812,0.148628568485881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909441293323209,0.0,0.1773502300118852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10151953697942609,0.30536179028780347,0.4303799454215837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14407357144978386,0.0,0.09903742876905694,0.2208265234575735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668180993002886,0.09567607608731067,0.06514521736891818,0.0,0.14295819490068767,

She makes up for a quickie script and cheap Production values by giving a performance that is at times way over-the-top and at other times sensitive and perceptive. Davis' Margaret Elliot is a has-been hag who drinks too much, shouts at people, and is completely removed from reality. In short - she's a Diva, 1950's style. Imagine Margo Channing from ""All About Eve"" after falling on hard times. The script is supposedly based on Joan Crawford but Margaret Elliot is much more Bette Davis in most places, especially in the scene where she comes from her auction only to be greeted by her Sister wanting a monthly check. She ""goes off"" on her and orders her out. Later, after being humiliated into accepting a Sales Clerk job at May Co. she declares that she will not degrade herself by ""waiting on a couple of old bags.""

1432458,B004XKVRBE,A3D0WBUQJ1UFOT,2,2,1314057600,Series (Five Stars)  Package (Four Stars),"This superb series is even better in season two and deserves Five Stars. The package deserves only four stars because, unlike its predecessors, it is not packaged in a protective outer case. This may seem picky however, it breaks the visual continuity of the displayed sets. I do agree that it is a bit overpriced for half of a season although, I would have purchased it had it been twice the price. Unfortunately, the public is taken advantage of when shows are released in partial seasons. The only reason for this is to make greater profits. If the majority of consumers would simply not buy such sets this tactic would eventually be discontinued. I intend to be more disciplined in this respect in the future.",1.0,125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052339823248467476,0.08450210224130095,0.0,0.0,0.17896128828294902,0.12711870402351533,0.12155146169266899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12268942559293569,0.0,0.0,0.1159207144685125,0.0,0.0,0.1427059021649525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11698868714683885,0.0,0.08382516523802586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977603631078007,0.32056945380664564,0.0,0.2948538078645883,0.2867853063561373,0.1321686997128191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372309356077668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16536033962777974,0.22857665001107663,0.0,0.0,0.233021737304476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398269223458355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07044262328880758,0.397130136521879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27696437041519595,0.0,0.11423263335755734,0.0,0.130547440114094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666127622362975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3369910058486164,0.0,

1419685,B004M64QSK,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,0,2,1322265600,"Poor packaging lead to scratches, TWICE","NOTE: I RETURNED both Speed Buggy and Wheelie & The Chopper Bunch. Speedy came in playable condition. Wheelie has to go back. Disc two has fingerprints on it and it looks like it was rubbed on a table. This disc is the worst of both shipments. WT Heck is going on? Wheelie has to go BACK to Amazon.com. The second shipment came just a day after I shipped both sets back to Amazon.com. I'm waiting until at least tomorrow to send Wheelie back 3 hrs to Orlando, Florida.On a positive note, Speed Buggy has brought back many good memories. The little dune buggy car is adorable. Love that little car and his sputtering voice and ""Room a Zoom Zoom"". The cartoon was no frills but the little talking car is great fun almost forty years later. It's GREAT that Hanna Barbara resurrected this cute cartoon.*****************************************************************************************************************I ordered ""Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch"" and ""Speed Buggy"" from Amazon.com. The two items came together in a box from Amazon. The dvd boxes were sealed with plastic so I thought everything would be just fine. Well, I was WRONG. Both sets have CIRCULAR SCRATCHES on them. Them have these SCRATCHES due to POOR and CHEAP design. To save MONEY the manufacturer put a SWINGING DUAL DVD retainer in both boxes. Wheelie is a three disc set and Speed is a FOUR disc set. The sets are the same size as a normal SINGLE disc box. The SWINGING DUAL DVD RETAINER allowed the discs to SPIN in place. Since the discs are mounted back to back in an offset position the design left a perforated area in the plastic where the retainer ring sits. So the delicate back side of the disc was pushed into the hard plastic perforation causing circular scratches. So both sets have scratches. This set also will not play on my cheap Samsung DVD recorder/vhs player. So I need to either watch these CARTOONS on my computer or I need to buy another dvd player. The design of the discs is not the standard dvd format. I ran into this format before with the tv movie about Ted Bundy called ""The Deliberate Stranger"". I had to watch that dvd set on the computer. At least that movie did not arrive with scratches.This review is only for the packaging",0.0,387,0.04329229621163409,0.05450730341415524,0.0,0.05039370494807441,0.03982769753427915,0.1753834673624811,0.07078869764301404,0.03333693946906787,0.07897792104209195,0.0374796489970464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03079319912046781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35625931387027326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029886726756754477,0.08009552395302971,0.0,0.04011012567419736,0.0828363368337954,0.04900160222311673,0.16977383564878265,0.10533242581289445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04242380535282514,0.0,0.0,0.16112754739027257,0.10291881593033968,0.19760281934019122,0.09609776704552297,0.0,0.08448013377328797,0.04017966404089001,0.049894567452191126,0.05411356892290855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639558695853869,0.0,0.0,0.08525844286913357,0.049170039619205234,0.10389365566282745,0.0718058024743677,0.26441498344682657,0.0,0.04880146430911577,0.0439371532240811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15817098742595617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802171612092593,0.5821934333429302,0.0,0.10508466040953413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160086350232037,0.0,0.31100685272920575,0.0,0.10936157824709533,0.0,0.0,0.12813651040490362,0.10168952965325342,0.0,0.0,0.045663459973590635,0.050850935530233544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04622326307139688,0.09441935675347615,0.047050416081785805,0.0,

And it's not for lack of time that these things aren't spelled out: a lot of meaningless and incongruous new stuff is added in that is not in the book and therefore unnecessary.Yes, the book is mucked about with but it's not all to ill effect: Tom Hardy gives a delicious performance and is disarmingly likeable as Ricky Tarr. Unfortunately, the time spent here on Tarr is taken away from getting to know the four suspects, and even the mole doesn't get enough airtime, unlike in the miniseries, where everyone is explored. I also missed seeing much of the Peter Gwillem character, who is quite yummy in the miniseries and has a lot of screentime therein, but Benedict Cumberbatch as Gwillem here is hardly seen, plus there's a homosexual plotline tagged onto him that is needless but not entirely out of place.I'm of two or three minds about Gary Oldman as Smiley. Oldman's leathery expressionless face hardly moves, especially not behind those immense glasses which he does not remove even when swimming. So even though Oldman gives a presumably authentic reading of the character, he's much less expressive than Alec Guinness -- who though more cheerful and perhaps less stolid than LeCarre wrote him, is often more appealing to watch because his face actually moves and his eyes twinkle.All in all, I'd say this movie has merit on its own, and is certainly worth watching. I think it could be a bit of a puzzle for newcomers, especially if they do not pay attention, but some folks love being puzzled like that so this can work for some people. Do check it out if you have the inclination -- for instance, it's just $3.99 to ""rent"" it for a 48-hour viewing on Amazon Instant. That's how I watched it and it was totally worth it. It's worth it even if you are just the least bit curious and/or want to compare it to the book or miniseries.",1.0,421,0.07701080404357957,0.0,0.09799670555086262,0.04482159733240492,0.0,0.31198210812172017,0.03148074253232471,0.08895247206274792,0.0,0.033335467936649064,0.04735729746675077,0.0,0.0,0.10955339544701702,0.0,0.03901088521663459,0.0914143936324999,0.0,0.0,0.21592777395795756,0.07286589099073996,0.0,0.1860747455577253,0.03561962080829174,0.04355362051292585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550084387393703,0.0936856613478936,0.07768383882132153,0.0,0.1007181510972115,0.07546588300232968,0.0468109630552561,0.10926008013652948,0.19108191008450545,0.0,0.285599565762781,0.25641627799519034,0.049238642544182705,0.07513903854609726,0.07147387652675044,0.04437765021883116,0.0,0.0,0.11592421666808347,0.0,0.02844208653197616,0.0,0.13069064468565555,0.0,0.0,0.21561394907137124,0.19159838126325104,0.1175891108712878,0.0,0.0,0.11723686867860603,0.0,0.19051977093584127,0.04950641000785534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14068178387320548,0.07877755855855573,0.0,0.0872464791482334,0.18370078610669677,0.4068581246171059,0.04436722346625818,0.0,0.0,0.037400839336542466,0.0369248065231322,0.0619088316461318,0.07982078538218863,0.14894834666212337,0.0,0.04863465217409958,0.0,0.0,0.05698413203460604,0.045222782842978246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04522827124262277,0.038483452050105324,0.03973600757738452,0.13163805261620834,0.14898970085184773,0.0,0.0559861778126146,0.04184798093557307,0.06142955110699345,

The wonderful Donald Crisp does his usual excellent job, as the father of the young girl who's being haunted, played by Gail Russell.The story begins with brother & sister on Holiday in England. They buy a beautiful but isolated mansion on a cliffside at a very cut rate price. They find out in due course that the house is said to be haunted.I won't spoil the story, but the cast is more than competent, the plot first rate, and the ending, satisfying.If you like your ghost stories a bit more sophisticated than the currant fare, you won't go wrong with The Uninvited. sloanranger-Wattpad.",1.0,128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863843032735516,0.16288491737861485,0.0,0.08256323073450857,0.09779950442031925,0.09282318524958637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22878998893067284,0.20443855682420112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12197191520043876,0.07401833390874633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10511670078741715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10506802621251897,0.0,0.10141219234491622,0.13301771833026346,0.0,0.1835208265981284,0.05949962894023586,0.0,0.0,0.09951012078121624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21519532007458117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11855755471631546,0.16371445336364598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10610111743380583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.343863673046395,0.24293932551782615,0.07307400090533217,0.5664517315821607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20563552086417008,0.05746206972300669,0.0,0.05924989135601173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837495945407667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371609773660269,0.0,0.15589447744944418,0.0,0.1710516442438927,

Whether movies, television or the Kardashian family, there is LOTS of drama behind the scenes!

I think he's probably right on that.  This was meant to be the story of NYC arson investigator Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) who after the first fire-homicide comes up against a pair of Eastern European criminals who are behind a series of arson-murders. One of them is Czech and the other is Russian, with the Russian capturing everything they do on video so he can realize the American dream of becoming a Hollywood director. The Czech's father was a fireman so that is why he is so good at setting fires.  It is this aspect, the Russian capturing everything on video and keeping his movie rolling despite anything else that might happen, that made this action adventure film (not my favorite genre by a long shot) work for me. I thoroughly enjoyed that part and found it very funny.  My standards aren't as high as hubby's in this genre so if you are a true devotee of this genre, be warned that it may fall short for you too.  Any action adventure movie that keeps me laughing, by contrast, gets positive marks for doing so.",0.5,225,0.0,0.08149850171050513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09833652271947342,0.10584219791811217,0.09968978276908366,0.05904330089708241,0.11207801694705273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12342319418776851,0.0655797402145153,0.07683665921698303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18373818647548834,0.07363661536792701,0.17874474054970113,0.0,0.0,0.059972057708109455,0.0,0.0732664599504122,0.0,0.0,0.2611827924682012,0.0,0.0,0.19029431048035314,0.0,0.06122434487520423,0.08030516324769187,0.07694133419526038,0.18465798045944756,0.14368393850687902,0.0,0.06315671383073791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474768502974859,0.06495862177481358,0.0,0.1434387839881992,0.0,0.0,0.12747714373631291,0.07351830501618126,0.05178007804087342,0.21472591558296392,0.14825599252948998,0.105552787884925,0.0,0.0,0.1504801322658092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756935269460686,0.0,0.0,0.2956186070915346,0.06621500379080007,0.06919887251506379,0.0,0.39704467051263653,0.24871053733649992,0.0,0.0785605032692755,0.0,0.0628731522977441,0.06207291133772306,0.24283611712083525,0.0,0.07154042720743314,0.07975784520681624,0.0,0.0677012681659818,0.06542789126267504,0.19158778655889674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12523050710390196,0.0,0.0941162697581992,0.0,0.10326692103293054,

1159083,B00188NXN4,A2NC9G399V3UF0,0,0,1239753600,Stupendous,"The tagline for the film says it best:  Once upon a time in the far away kingdom of Dor...lived a brave and virtuous mouse with comically oversized ears who dreamt of becoming a knight.  Banished from his home for having such lofty ambitions, Desperaux sets off on an amazing adventure with his good hearted rat friend Roscuro, who leads him at long last, on a very noble quest to rescue an endangered princess and save an entire kingdom from darkness.Whew.  That is a mouthful, yet it does not even scratch the surface of the Universal animated film.  The story is enchanting, and the entire production is packed with big name voice actors, and a manifold thematic presence.Matthew Broderick is Desperaux, repeating an earlier role from Ladyhawke when he played Phillipe the Mouse who also crawled through a sewage system to escape.  Other actors included in the cast are Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Kline, William H Macy, Tracy Ullman, Emma Watson, Sigourney Weaver, and Christopher Lloyd.  The 3D animation is outstanding (very early Disney like in many spots) , and only on a couple of occasions are the backgrounds not meshed well.  It`s not a far stretch to imagine Mickey Mouse in the place of Desperaux, and Goofy as Roscuro as they take on the rats at the film climax.Not many of the modern animated films keep viewers interested in the story, but this one does.  Desperaux is a modern Galahad.  While his mouse companions are scurrying in fear, he is walking boldly into the unknown.  While others are eating books, he is reading them.  His befriending of the princess,  is enough to outcast him.  Roscuro, the rat, is inspired by Desperaux`s tales of honor and bravery.  His honor, is tested and in the end rings true.  The mourning king, lives in the past, while playing his mandolin amidst tears.  The dark pall that hangs over the kingdom remains as long as a king does not hope, and forgiveness does not live in the hearts of the Dorians.  The Princess`servant, traveled to the castle to be in the big house, to be a princess.  Once there, even being near her princess was enough.  The jailer, who lost his daughter many years ago, still mourned too.  Only when he found her, and she realized that she has value to her father, does she truly become a princess in her own life.  Specifically, the themes of courage, forgiveness, redemption, and encouragement are dominant in the film.I really liked this film, and highly recommend it to film goers of all ages.Tim Lasiuta",0.0,427,0.0,0.0,0.030930276567389982,0.04244054105361513,0.13416826835940976,0.24001956272886912,0.14904196027787214,0.11230273698643149,0.06651357949906313,0.06312917788335837,0.0,0.0,0.043834485224467375,0.025933398482825713,0.03475973698077111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178281989654138,0.2069851157958375,0.0,0.050339972232054886,0.10118220250055049,0.0,0.033779922256073014,0.0,0.0,0.03574500748211603,0.0,0.14711408548196062,0.17764091364561369,0.09536770398396834,0.25009918961260375,0.0,0.0,0.2713966078474046,0.043338054199247196,0.22882341238540263,0.08093156142535424,0.0,0.0,0.033838486037193326,0.0,0.1367200017817754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749941967121378,0.2217356858385008,0.11134242830259307,0.02972688536066684,0.08219917752114801,0.0,0.04237979621912544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04012894600432953,0.0,0.0,0.14164934759133024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795405470807049,0.0,0.0745465950570032,0.5603558014556548,0.0,0.044250069019647,0.0,0.0354139957469701,0.034963251209452255,0.03908003384430072,0.03779023417908626,0.18133170224838793,0.044924485057877966,0.0,0.0,0.0737059612324459,0.02697848290728867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03845682609873948,0.0,0.0,0.07525022584036785,0.0,0.14107492574784167,0.0,0.07951803882411224,0.0,0.0,

819148,B0001ZX0OC,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,17,22,1114300800,A Masterful Psychological Study,"""Mystic River"" aspires to transcend its genre so boldly that I found myself overwhelmed by its audacity. Those who expect a plot driven murder mystery or a crime story will be sorely disappointed. In this film, the plot recedes into insignificance. Like all great works of art, the heart and soul of this work is not its plot, but its characters and its themes. The result is one of the most powerful explorations of tragedy to come out of modern cinema.Clint Eastwood has crafted a film of unique scope, examining multifaceted aspects of tragedy with a mix of depth and simplicity that, on the one hand, relentlessly examines themes of sin, guilt, victimization and vengeance, while on the other, combines directing and acting so clean and uncluttered that we are not so much audiences to a narrative as we are witnesses to broken lives.This film cannot be approached lightly. It is unsparing in its intensity. Characters are trapped in the arc of tragedy as inevitably as in a Greek play, unrelieved by either redemption or reprieve. The darkness of the story does not result from some self-indulgent existential auteurism. Rather, it arises out of an uncompromising sense of authenticity. Eastwood takes this tragedy to its honest conclusion and does not give in to the Hollywood hankering for happy endings. This is an intelligent film for mature people who refuse to put up with cop-outs.The acting is nothing short of inspiring. Sean Penn is unforgettable as a tormented Jimmy who claws his way out of evil through the love of his daughter, only to sink back deeper than ever in the aftermath of her murder. Tim Robbins, in a similarly pitch-perfect performance, is tormented by even crueller demons, and never finds any sort of relief, save for transient moments of grace with his son. Kevin Bacon gives a subtle and restrained performance as a cop who acts as our disjointed moral sense, never sure of guilt or innocence, counting on the law to separate good from evil, and silently praying that that will prove sufficient. The supporting women, from Laura Linney to Marcia Gay Harden turn in performances in every way equal to those of the lead male characters. Character flaws abound, suspicion builds to blind fury, events unfold and vengeance compounds into tragedy until we arrive at an ending nothing short of Shakespearean.It's a shame that the typical film synopsis leaves the impression that this is another who-dunnit. This film is no more about story than ""Hamlet"" is just about some guy out to catch his father's murderer. In both cases, focusing on the plot is to entirely miss the point. This film is a modern work of art, sharing a deeper kinship to masterful psychological studies like ""Heart of Darkness"" or ""Crime and Punishment"" than to any crime story. What matters is not how characters act, but why they act. We are compelled not by the arc of the story but by the arc of tragedy. We sympathise not with the virtues of the characters, but with their tragic flaws.Approach this film the way you would ""Othello"". Then prepare to be moved by a depth of insight rare to our superficial age.",0.7727272727272727,533,0.05808536458434926,0.0,0.02463799047713634,0.0,0.08015535791372863,0.17648427437326691,0.09497734402779864,0.13418472471784604,0.02649121055752094,0.07542978544651006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08263059962849323,0.16613043860517987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03257268543031287,0.21983626305553117,0.0,0.060148625915309846,0.08059824929895887,0.0,0.02690791985161234,0.027785421696631632,0.0,0.02847323890010265,0.0,0.0,0.03537565473440376,0.0,0.11384021715679299,0.035307147995369374,0.0,0.18015430676537775,0.06904319554545599,0.21541334502981355,0.04835046581348544,0.2599675691659036,0.028336793146567594,0.0539091394755952,0.03347182287434432,0.0,0.0,0.029145262897183062,0.034881768386086795,0.0,0.0,0.03285778681146334,0.0,0.0329857726181421,0.16262672487089874,0.44959597999057616,0.08869153440136893,0.0473588211754446,0.03273851348503122,0.11790114117963235,0.03375828254864845,0.11495956176821825,0.03734018765654342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958187953109384,0.059417938388868455,0.15523877173931752,0.09870842694665637,0.13855623594581382,0.36266756965036395,0.033463958500869015,0.0,0.036164818526178,0.0,0.027850518842641586,0.1400841259281644,0.0,0.2888851474356992,0.0,0.0,0.030375817793832693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10830470596228861,0.1756313781422569,0.0,0.0,0.029026126535826643,0.0,0.0,0.1404692692273969,0.062017848964519784,0.1055688740793326,0.03156382094629373,0.023166605754975943,

""The Devil Inside"" was theatrically released and hit the No. 1 at the box office, displacing Tom Cruise's ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol."" While the commercial success of ""The Devil's Inside"" proves the popularity of the found footage genre, the film itself is a huge disappointment because, simply put, the film is just boring.""The Devil Inside"" begins with a murder case involving Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley), who apparently killed two priests and a nun during the exorcism performed on her. Twenty years later, her daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels to a hospital in Rome, where Maria was locked in. Isabella attempts to find the truths about the murder with a help from young priests Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth), who perform an unauthorized exorcism.""The Devil Inside"" is not scary. That itself is not a real problem. ""The Last Exorcism"" was not particularly scary, but it at least had a few interesting characters. In ""The Devil Inside"" you have none. We relate to none of the characters that keep talking, and then yelling. The storyline seems contrived. Some of the questions are left unanswered (for the sequel, perhaps).Actors are so desperate trying to look real that it is obvious they are acting. The acting is amateurish, and so is writing.  The abrupt ending (with a brief note from the filmmakers) has been already criticized. What really amazed me is the end credit that rolls so slowly. In short, we feel short-changed.Apparently the film was really shot in Rome.

No Contest.,"Viewed: 11/02, 11/03, 3/05, 4/06Rate: 104/06: Casablanca is one of the most honored films of all time and ranks one of the top two most romantic films ever made, rivaling with Gone with the Wind. Serious writing, brilliant acting, ravishing cinematography, and unpredictably thrilling story are throughout the picture. Everything that I desire in a film is all contained in Casablanca. When I think of Humphrey Bogart, I think of him as dark, mysterious Richard Blaine, a typical anti-hero who turns out to be a greater hero than imagined. Ingrid Bergman has never been more beautiful. Paul Henreid is just a classic...easily the best role of his career. Sixty-two years have passed by, there will always be Casablanca, and Casablanca will always have a place in my heart. From the start to the end, Casablanca is impeccably made because every aspect as possible in this film is streamed through without any flaw. It stands the test of time as the better alternative of Romeo and Juliet story. Precisely exquisite and rare, Casablanca is a masterpiece.",0.0,175,0.0,0.0,0.14816279218613632,0.0,0.0,0.22110504247117127,0.07139435995521123,0.20173300559326818,0.0,0.1512012872441466,0.10740038734396214,0.10269672089799214,0.10498838752296138,0.0,0.08325337271889344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16525066537132638,0.0,0.0,0.08078081471058365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08561320335635701,0.14164485525387663,0.0,0.0,0.11420804204465933,0.08557355992912018,0.0,0.0,0.2166748553579158,0.0,0.298940239371612,0.048459985843638295,0.0,0.08520293889415471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763384201022613,0.20976468049489289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08598790713902112,0.0,0.0,0.38624089094605,0.0,0.14239828500845642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641496998243385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18670848905301551,0.09893201424232463,0.05951575013967426,0.37746940678836177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482039403862034,0.0,0.046800478169705076,0.1810234900791208,0.09651316982946058,0.0,0.22059453394714787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011626156053369,0.0,0.08447247012450441,0.1864749821315244,0.1269696014052404,0.0,0.0,

Alex and Hugh return but take on the ice roads of Alaska, including a stretch of ice over the Arctic Ocean. New characters include, Jack, a veteran of the Alaskan ice roads, Lisa, a young lady in her second year of driving the ice roads, trying to earn the respect of her fellow drivers, and a couple of other new minor players.Alex and Hugh find themselves at a huge disadvantage as newcomers and are treated as rookies. Hugh's hard-driving demeanor and his arrogant attitude makes it hard for him to be accepted on the Alaskan roads. Alex, on the other hand, takes it all in stride, realizing there is a lot to learn and a lot more danger on the Alaskan roads. Lisa has a goal to make it to the &#34;heavy-haul&#34; team, and she struggles through the challenges, taking two giant steps forward and then one small step back. Jack, her mentor and friend, seems happy to teach her the skills and tricks that will help her advance her career. He is a very patient and cautious, yet determined man who faces each challenge with the confidence that only years of experience on the ice roads can give him.

1395518,B004BR7XGM,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,2,3,1332374400,"Kidnap, Hit men, Landfill and Elephants in this Thai Based Action Fest!","This is set in Bangkok and tells the story of Curtie Church (Djimon Hounsou) who is a hired `hit man'. He has been hired by a distraught father whose daughter has been abducted by some drug gang where by they turn her into an addict as her introduction to being trafficked onto the sex industry. Where she winds up on a mortuary slab.So as retribution he pays him to kill six for a fixed bounty. Church duly obliges and attracts the attention of one of the girls, who follows him and becomes a sort of partner, Mae. The grieving father then asks for a bit more revenge and Church is starting to feel empathy for the girls so he signs up. This time he needs some new weaponry and where better to go than an International Arms Dealer in the shape of Jimmy `The Brit' (Kevin Bacon) who after an initial reticence agrees to hire some kick butt guns that the army would be proud of. A word on Mr Bacon, I have immense respect for him as an actor, but he really could have done with a language coach on his Mary Poppins attempts at an English accent. It is dubbed at one point and then he starts to sound like a lost Australian, pretty poor and verging on the embarrassing.Meanwhile Churchy has declared war on the gangs who have formed an uneasy alliance to find out who is killing them all. Church and Mae take up residence at a Buddhist Temple which he uses to launch his attacks from and we get lots of Eastern wisdom from the ephemeral Mae.This is a very full on action film, the action is pretty much there right from the start and is actually really good though not gratuitous. There are a few twists in the plot but nothing heart stopping and some nudity but mainly incidental which you would expect in a film of this nature. The few plot holes are forgivable until the end and that is where you have to do a rather large leap of faith to believe what has happened, I can not say what, as it is a plot spoiler. So for a ninety minute action fest with some decent plot and questionable accents, this is the one for you. If you can live with that and the plot holes then you should enjoy, but I felt it was just OK, hence the rating but will still give Mr Bacon another chance as he still tends to deliver in most of his films.",0.6666666666666666,427,0.0,0.047955475531191186,0.03231191405888613,0.0,0.2102422304831322,0.270028873912561,0.06227983123492521,0.14664904378470095,0.10422705370125183,0.03297456079855769,0.0,0.0895859904048389,0.0,0.13545914166111553,0.10893730273491747,0.07717706611025185,0.0452123468977043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720770069039192,0.0,0.15776588867011176,0.10570195272464984,0.043082086333093426,0.035288851765549877,0.0,0.0,0.14936686482966516,0.12356182877808594,0.3073711724877642,0.0927880150465696,0.14944158590415604,0.11197327507174502,0.0,0.03602572453424149,0.118133223627613,0.04527393991173711,0.23904482132738009,0.06341004545489369,0.0,0.03716277208995606,0.0353500315567619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03822305357376206,0.04574629182356147,0.0,0.0,0.04309190656609939,0.0,0.0,0.06093702861710892,0.21058226377438902,0.17447404486907236,0.0931643041974856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03769142093334413,0.0,0.0,0.08384296543488641,0.0,0.0,0.049325580561775245,0.0,0.10436901720696708,0.19481167919913675,0.04071810853001744,0.04315095166206793,0.07787654816523783,0.36586660604990434,0.0,0.04622669390451124,0.14228690963138527,0.07399183674059315,0.03652503933605786,0.10206429065095504,0.039478301993174036,0.23152761387478868,0.0,0.0,0.11951065752706451,0.03849918185796797,0.028183596070993668,0.0,0.0,0.04606695502900395,0.0,0.0,0.07613362030952413,0.0,0.0868085803314357,0.1842208259396053,0.040667184438563375,0.08307006343825588,0.08278982579631664,0.15191120698044117,

594522,B00005JL3A,A329U9CDUPKXAC,1,4,1031961600,There are better video game movies,"Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'",0.25,163,0.0,0.0,0.07444959666278725,0.0,0.0,0.13332238942749158,0.14349841074770672,0.06757855409529262,0.0,0.15195279036155024,0.0,0.10320714582431802,0.0,0.06242204310508161,0.0,0.0,0.10417337037285192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16607199693829278,0.0,0.06058449914805675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14234886083628673,0.0,0.1068960242152222,0.0,0.0,0.10668901467462975,0.08300655467735596,0.054437944069314105,0.20863057258826387,0.25035503087636973,0.19480336983988544,0.0,0.17125283187657084,0.08144969643771233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12964732999853862,0.10644208964967167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21060670658992564,0.0,0.0670006850773114,0.0715530176498941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08684447108335556,0.0,0.0,0.09659091919258597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24047573353251422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25289700761605616,0.10111937560175241,0.0,0.10928067186142489,0.17048393950407345,0.42078510757769794,0.14109926002134893,0.0,0.2424821529221547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887056259170992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056415888155417,0.3000223283321959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07000345487203187,

1218879,B001N26GFM,A3NPVNPMXN8L2G,1,4,1252800000,Drives A Powerful Emotional Steak Into Inhumanity.,"A story of innocence against a diabolical truth. It is set in WW11, but really it could happen anytime, anywhere. For in reality, it is a story of mankind's struggle within Himself.Seeing the cover of DVD with two innocent children, one in pajamas, next to a barbed wire fence; I knew in my gut that this was Tombstone Territory Hardcore. Experience weathers the face of innocence, laugh lines troubled by worry lines next door to evil. Some live in evil's mist never knowing; many Germans have claimed suprise over the Holocaust, some even denying it. In 2000 there were a suspected 5,000 to 7,000 camps. Today we know there were over 20,000 such camps. Six known extermination camps, 12,000 ghettos of starvation, 10+ million slave laborers, 10+ million POWs, and thats not counting other types of camps. Each camp was an island unto itself with many independent bureaucracies, giving free reign to their many independent commandants, to have absolute power over thier prisoners. Even today the truth is still slowly coming to light.In this fabled/allegorical movie the fence represents a fact. The fence is seperating the two innocent children and they both wonder at its purpose. On one side, hunger & abuse. The other, an abundance of food/toys. Both wonder what the truth is. The irony, of course, is that both are being protected from it (sound familiar?). This brings to my mind an observation by the screenwriter Robert McKee, ""What happens is fact. Truth is what we think about what happens."".Shumel, the boy inside the fence, is close to death's door and not aware of it. Bruno, son of the SS officier running the camp, is just as unaware of the fact that this where the ovens of hell on earth are burning. A holocaust of inhumanity so diabolically evil that it cloaks itself in plain sight/shadowed by its very own unbelievable reality.By keeping the truth from the boys, they know not what they do. When they dig a hole. Are they digging their way out/in/ or their own graves? The truth is killing them, not protecting them. The only ones protected by the truth are those that keep it from us, keepers of the darkness that fears the light of day.The Founding Fathers knew that a secret government is a bad government. That power corrupted. The Germany of the 1930's had passed from the light into the darkness quickly/quietly, as quick the rest of the world followed...into hell.The two inocent children here should have been told the FACTS. This week was the week of 9/11. More than one third of Americans do not believe the government's official findings. There are secrets. There are truths. What we must demand are the FACTS. History may not repeat itself but it Damn sure rhymes.So this movie is very prescience in its meaning and message. Fences are still being built. Don't depend on the Goebbels of today. You just have to dig out the Damn truth yourself.But remember, when you find the truth, it just may be.... unbelievable.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!",0.25,508,0.03093744962077444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538475621307508,0.06266608219761477,0.20234748060902796,0.04764634706800021,0.02821951787275035,0.026783627899571404,0.0,0.036383165899858336,0.0,0.0660161134762773,0.1474740987281835,0.0,0.0734475696687624,0.03789007434455806,0.03636989731684585,0.06939550585416561,0.0,0.0,0.02135758978565029,0.11447538957198952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03501742186887067,0.0,0.10036324865098924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19190771477127536,0.07354762767281865,0.22946708029437157,0.1716829601799243,0.11868345295373968,0.09055652314412305,0.0,0.0,0.11601157426499999,0.0,0.031046722664758126,0.0,0.04570400894372064,0.0,0.0,0.06092720903772859,0.0,0.14848853118227748,0.34209140977728086,0.0708583796529408,0.07567282161517301,0.034874399733908296,0.03139827598206643,0.0719213986591098,0.06122980678662817,0.0,0.0,0.03405077632304428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05651590910120914,0.06329441120427089,0.06614666829406586,0.035049413997949946,0.1686808608533573,0.5794924287091417,0.10694152005146654,0.07509537889705388,0.0,0.12019992229601227,0.1483375424725857,0.09948221597838977,0.0,0.15386612030304894,0.0,0.11722761138361618,0.0,0.06254201641204857,0.06867648257534954,0.0,0.038456863254947016,0.11225382404642367,0.0,0.07267797709067131,0.18551888252353052,0.06385237748513209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04498250802724575,0.0,0.04935602650048794,
1223446,B001OQCV2E,A328S9RN3U5M68,0,0,1269820800,Noah's Ark: The Haves and and Have Nots,"2012 is an odd film.  It can be viewed on a number of levels: it brings to the public eye the old Mayan prediction that the earth and civilization as we know it will be destroyed on December 21, 2012, it is an exercise in computer generated graphics in the hands of Roland Emmerich, it poses a few questions as to what is important in life and how learning what is important is learning how to live in the now, and it is a roller coaster corny simplistic mess of a plot that sells out at every chance it gets to make a meaningful statement.The cast, watching the crumbling and burning of the planet, is huge. John Cusack is a satisfying hero/returned dad, Chiwetel Ejiofor represents the good in science, Oliver Platt propels the action with his usual ability to steal a scene, Woody Harelson is, well, Woody Harelson as dopey as ever, Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet add the appropriate glamour and love interests, Danny Glover makes a fine President of the USA, Johann Urb is a very screen-powerful presence as a Russian pilot, and Osric Chau makes a very positive impression as a personality the camera loves and a character with whom we can identify (he needs some important roles to allow us to further examine his potential).  And there are others equally as well cast.What will bother those who find a degree of credence and associated anxiety with the Mayan prediction will be sorry to see the silly manner in which 400,000 of mankind and animalkind are saved in boats to land in Africa to restart civilization.  But then this is Hollywood and Roland Emmerich tends to concentrate more on CGI than on content.  It is long, but then it is entertaining - to a point.

The plot is not new(Stage Door, How to Marry a Millionaire and Valley of the Dolls to mention but a few), but Judy, Hedy and Lana do an admirable job. Never mind highbrow critcs; Hedy Lamarr wasn`t THAT bad and Lana does one of her best acting jobs ever. Judy is a tomboy and it`s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of Lana`s character Sheila.The musical numbers are good, but sadly;  footage from THE GREAT ZIEGFELD are edited in(note the finale). James Stewart are good as well - as are Edvard Everett Horton, Charles Winninger and Eve Arden. The film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of Garbo`s first sound-entrance in ANNA CHRISTIE.",1.0,125,0.0,0.0,0.08887092268290749,0.0,0.19275058497924794,0.31829544534345106,0.4282372483642312,0.1613378372814569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259481511179199,0.2235406831669384,0.0,0.0,0.12435236668852369,0.0,0.0,0.11749191197789845,0.09912056116669445,0.11917341916279349,0.0,0.09690780569776958,0.0,0.2911761412006749,0.10022392311600314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552048292798786,0.0,0.0,0.12735530613027277,0.0,0.12996578988368512,0.12452177256085736,0.17931016625704685,0.05813448291004533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380082264529108,0.23167479398687776,0.0,0.08541325922952805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14279481510940767,0.3521987580104963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10175384209916795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578095049694785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049670414051178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15231766981535794,0.0,0.0,

432781,6304697961,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,3,3,1383177600,The Legacy of John Carpenter's 'Halloween',"During the fall of 1978, the devil came home - to Haddonfield, Illinois.Upon its initial release, Halloween had difficulty finding its traction with moviegoers, but after a few positive reviews, John Carpenter's horror flick was off and running.  Even more spectacular is that fact that the film was produced on a ridiculously tiny budget of $325,000, eventually cashing in big with an impressive $70 million.By now, most everyone is probably at least vaguely familiar with the concept of the boogeyman and quite possibly even well-acquainted with the boogeyman himself - the man in the white mask that walked around stalking babysitters, Michael Myers.  This cold-hearted killer has engrained himself in pop culture, creating legions of fans, endless merchandise, and several sequels featuring the character, including two reboot films.  Myers is the villain everyone loves to hate, having been forged into the spitting image of evil - unrelenting in his mission to stalk and eventually eliminate his prey.The creation of the Michael Myers, one of the most iconic and recognizable characters in the horror genre, leaves little doubt that Halloween is the greatest horror film ever created.Directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precinct 13, The Fog) and co-written with Debra Hill, Halloween stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, who along with her high school friends, Anne (Nancy Kyes), and Lynda (P.J. Soles), is stalked by an escaped murderous mental patient, named Michael Myers (portrayed by five different actors, including Nick Castle & Tony Moran).  Desperate to find him before he kills innocent people in the small town of Haddonfiled, Illinois, Myers' doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), sets out to stop him.  However, Myers' whereabouts is unknown to everyone, except for two young children, Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) and Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards).  Charles Cyphers also stars in a supporting role as Sheriff Leigh Brackett.Halloween is not only the best horror film ever created, but it's also the most important horror film ever created - okay, maybe it's the second most important film, slightly behind Psycho.  Following in the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Halloween continues the trend of a modern day killer unleashing his fury on the innocent women of suburbia.  Both of these films took the simple premise of a mysterious killer shadowing beautiful women - just before mutilating them, and made it, well - hip and frighteningly entertaining.  There's just something so nail-biting and downright creepy about a man lurking in the shadows waiting to strike a moment's notice.While Halloween is responsible for elevating the career of director John Carpenter, it's also responsible for introducing Jamie Lee Curtis - the (at the time) unknown daughter of ""scream queen"" and Psycho star, Janet Leigh.  The amount of screen time devoted to her character was quite sizable, regardless of the fact she'd never acted in a feature role.  Regardless, Curtis demonstrated the scared, vulnerable qualities required to be the leading lady in this unnerving, often unpredictable slasher flick.  She's innocent, likeable, and had the make-up of a future Hollywood star - even though it's safe to say no one could have predicted the future roles she'd amass.  She would go on to star in several popular films, including True Lies, Trading Places, and three Halloween sequels (Halloween 2, Halloween H2O, and Halloween: Resurrection).Today, John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis are the top names that casual movie lovers typically associate with Halloween, but let's not forget that back in 1978, there was only one star of Halloween (pre-release): Donald Pleasence.  As the hard-nosed Dr. Sam Loomis, Pleasence has the film's most memorable lines, including the famous ""...the devil's eyes"" line.  He took on a role that he was incredibly uncertain of at the time - and wasn't even the first choice for the character.  As such a low-budget production, Halloween was unable to gain the interest of original sought-after, popular actors Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  Still, Pleasence turned out to be the right man for the role of Dr. Loomis - which quickly became the role that would define the rest of her career.  His professionalism illuminates this role as the overly concerned doctor, and he obviously become a fan favorite - which is never more evident in the way he returned to the role for four sequels (five Halloween films in total).The success and legacy of Halloween led to the creation of several similar, yet moderately unique horror films, including Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Regardless of the success of those individual franchises, Halloween still stands out as the one film that jump-started the slasher craze of the 1980s and beyond.  Without Halloween, there's little doubt that the more recent horror franchises, like Scream, Saw, and a slew of easily forgettable knockoffs, would have enjoyed the same successes that they achieved.  And, while the slasher ""craze"" is currently non-existent (at least for the moment) from overuse and a lack of progressive originality, there's little chance Michael Myers won't rise from the ashes again one day to stalk babysitters (or his female relatives if you liked the direction of the sequels).Overall and on its own, the original Halloween is the best and most important horror film ever conceived or created.  Even today, the story is as solid as ever, but the acting, camera shots (in which we see through the killer's eyes), and imagination also have withstood the test of time.  Sure, the film owes some of its success to Psycho, but the character of Michael Myers/The Shape/The Boogeyman has taken on a life all its own - which eclipses the wildest dreams of his creators.  The fan base of Halloween is strong, despite that fact that the original conception might not be as scary to this generation as it was the previous generations.  Although the inclusion of several sequels to the franchise certainly diluted the original storyline, Halloween will forever and always be one of the greatest films (and not just of the horror genre) to ever grace the big screen.GRADE: AFNDNreview.com",1.0,997,0.016924983694349117,0.04261890923954277,0.014358094851294736,0.07880502622217517,0.03114102001223924,0.2571210052180171,0.013837306613344447,0.1303296905701783,0.061752327449509696,0.05861019198833528,0.0,0.019904177530859008,0.04069667435655198,0.060192509824727916,0.06454305049469315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09491068425483391,0.14412635070984953,0.01925380320622676,0.08178883660823748,0.03131308698130634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03831403696255582,0.049779400462545274,0.041179372437408206,0.08536449668940493,0.061846806042226254,0.04427049129575769,0.09951269995087712,0.0,0.016008360538672668,0.16797945444824705,0.020117889715845223,0.12553480134846742,0.056353668526541,0.10821380617199969,0.049540854091671714,0.015708110177665727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05095429144661894,0.12196670167555165,0.01250167055818699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019222868538488563,0.05415585317824239,0.3649392120774715,0.10337218570024682,0.08279682311512605,0.038157550417488854,0.0343541769306222,0.0,0.050245583952851725,0.021760457965730572,0.0,0.0,0.018415890324851768,0.0,0.08767309333770407,0.0,0.01545910945689222,0.017313270659136133,0.018093464329406474,0.0,0.14995568117415217,0.6909487487433399,0.0,0.02054125467569472,0.0,0.06575790021023437,0.016230235642452327,0.03628256161924305,0.07017017977369443,0.18705711823648763,0.0,0.042754556597599996,0.01770188495990475,0.0,0.08766547268920849,0.0,0.02103863736358947,0.02047027324383671,0.035703965052003565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07714837493275749,0.016372042136558542,0.018070835743121523,0.08613020093074875,0.05518262564108805,0.013500627136014557,

Fantastic!,"The Night of the Hunter, a movie about two children and a secret that preacher Harry Powell is desperate to get, is suspense at it's finest. I can't really tell much about the movie, or else I will ruin the entire plot, but Charles Laughton definitely proved himself as a director in this film. Sadly, it is his only movie he ever directed. Yet, if one only has one movie to direct, a movie such as this one would do fine. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat about ten minutes in. It's full of brilliantly directed scenes of action, and the acting itself is amazing in this movie. Once again, there is not a lot that I can say about this film except that it is simply a fantastic film and should be seen by everyone!",0.3333333333333333,140,0.34060168576019356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293588363261641,0.0,0.13113901057295596,0.0776697455399208,0.0737176862119397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060566292667343605,0.0811798116013015,0.17253648280654346,0.10107639103584708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24170224179019242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631399614570732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08348086680548061,0.0,0.08589459228309149,0.0,0.0,0.08344221076249744,0.0,0.08053884547536275,0.15845866085287516,0.0,0.2914946448377112,0.1890120432368032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700075420580645,0.0,0.0,0.4402756157235067,0.0,0.09633595018657184,0.08384623797891855,0.0,0.0681151870638488,0.1883104656047377,0.0650088157876174,0.2082774349881361,0.19197250395306933,0.08641877288322448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09371935921702719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17410023975710137,0.2453786101199011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08270780369767196,0.0,0.22817417941106927,0.0,0.0941093518247577,0.0,0.10755013353376368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09091525918659757,0.0,0.09254216359207686,0.0,

928608,B000AM6P2U,A328S9RN3U5M68,4,5,1132012800,The Janus Effect: The Polar Effects of Comedy and Tragedy,"Woody Allen's finest film that dealt with the potency of interpersonal relationships in a purely serious mode was the magnificent 'Interiors', a film that remains one of the most visually beautiful and hauntingly touching films of the past. In MELINDA & MELINDA he seems to be looking at his life in films from a high vantage that has revealed to him just how closely related comedy and tragedy are, how the lives we live and the stories we tell depend a great deal on personal perception drawing on our individual past experiences that bring us to the unique human we each become.  This seems to be the point of the bifurcated stories presented here by a fine cast in a very successful format.The opening, intervening, and closing scenes in a cafe where four people debate over drinks the differences between comedy and tragedy (two are writers specializing in one of the two forms of drama) set a marvelous 'Greek chorus' effect for the film.  The same story, essentially, is adapted by each of the two writers who share how they see the development of the accidental entry of a strange woman into the lives of two different couples/environments.  And it is this parallel of thought lines that propels this film.  There are some constants: the strange woman Melinda (brilliant Australian actress Rhada Mitchell) plays both forms of the character, the basic incidents of marital dysfunction, extramarital affairs, racially mixed couples, the 'woman on the edge' persona that pervades all of Allen's films, etc are the ideas that, while core, alter in each tale.  The two stories are closely interwoven so that acute attention from audience concentration is demanded.Rhada Mitchell gives a bravura performance as the two Melindas, and she is surrounded by some very fine actors as the various couples and lovers:  Chlo Sevigny, Jonny Lee Miller, Brooke Smith, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Sunjata, among others.  There are fans out there of Will Ferrell who probably would include his performance, but for this reviewer he is an awkward actor who vacillates between his own persona and that of Woody Allen here.Allen's script and direction are uniquely Woody Allen and in this film that combo succeeds.  There are some holes in the script and some dallying on certain moments that grow tiresome, but the ideas are smart and the concept rings true.  Recommended.

1292162,B002VECM4A,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,2,2,1270771200,EXTREAMLY GOOD ACTING,"PRECIOUSI have always been a fan of Tyler Perry and any thing he puts his hands on, so of course I had to see this. I knew that this would be great when Perry was announced as a producer, he was the main reason I wanted to see this. Then I found out that Mo'Nique was starring in it, which made me really interested since she is a comedian. Needless to say I was not disappointed by this film at all, this is a very powerful film. I also must say that the hype this film received was well worth it, at least in my eyes.The film follows the life of young Precious who is a mother trying to better her self in school and such. But her home life is not that grand with an abusive mother and her mother's boyfriend who rapes her. So we live her life with her feeling her pain being there for the downs but also for the highs. She finally meets some people who truly want to help her and her journey is an increasingly interesting if hard to watch one. From her mother to teachers there are people affecting her life for better or worse. This great film is based on the novel ""Push"" by Sapphire.I must say that Gabourey Sidibe did a marvelous job as Precious and gave a truly award winning performance. She gives a truly hauntingly wonderful performance and you can see every emotion she pushes forth. I hope she has a wonderful career and continues to get roles like this, she will no doubt win an Oscar one day. Also the now Academy award winning actress Mo'Nique portrays one of the coldest and most interesting characters ever on film. She defiantly deserved the Oscar because this was so far off from her usual career. I am absolutely impressed by her and I hope she does more serious roles because she may win an Oscar for leading lady one day.Also in the film I was actually impressed by Mariah Carey, I was not a big fan of her movie ""Glitter"" I think it was called. She did a really good job in this film as did singer Lenny Kravitz, I was impressed. Paula Patton as well did an excellent job in this film and really added another level to the film. It should also be said that all of the students in the film were really well cast as well. Geoffrey Fletcher did a great job turning this into a screenplay and director Lee Daniels did a marvelous job.This is a very hard film to watch at times with a lot of bad things happening to this girl, but it is a great film. It has been a long time since a film like this has come out, glad to see things like this come out. Tyler Perry was great to get behind this thing and I am glad that I went to see it. This is a great DVD with some good extras including a great commentary.",1.0,509,0.0,0.0,0.0452711611945434,0.15529545710945264,0.12273478404844368,0.1621408215265863,0.02181455634187253,0.10273257857927888,0.07301455030399337,0.04619957377053748,0.06563240576212442,0.06275799392445662,0.0,0.056936205879716754,0.10175231718396548,0.02703256292734448,0.0,0.0,0.031367553350444013,0.0,0.3534465421043552,0.0,0.07368020109619414,0.049365177724175834,0.060360895718783114,0.04944205080940439,0.17869046868041158,0.03020109842757357,0.07847737759945221,0.02163980234160311,0.05383095640392196,0.4550078378067838,0.0,0.026147012811929264,0.0,0.025237229517997884,0.1158588048876096,0.031715914877730046,0.13701184586673132,0.1036486866081445,0.0,0.0,0.07429165170725566,0.0,0.0,0.030395646757311674,0.026776532280506776,0.032046813250104104,0.019708922001923004,0.0,0.0,0.026273616657963492,0.030304911244856375,0.06403265155263153,0.1032639619161515,0.06111246300000262,0.08701963049326994,0.0,0.02707973268110527,0.0,0.07921231730261188,0.06861085752925233,0.0,0.11746962424800778,0.1451635380724305,0.0,0.3455422517770124,0.0,0.0731140005058487,0.05458884865521224,0.0,0.0,0.12729531854135992,0.1794112884739718,0.0,0.0,0.03322558571871619,0.05183376574441167,0.0,0.2573980638386767,0.027655875940415523,0.20642728467750088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393993882794423,0.21717910772652968,0.06267418522618727,0.0,0.032271448591054346,0.11257482095598796,0.03134089579540896,0.0,0.027535035909901626,0.0304061624614058,0.07743172401955152,0.02848872800743478,0.07759115776925014,0.028998526225208866,0.02128378011261111,

All words that could describe ""Scream 4,"" a woeful idea to squeeze just a few more dollars out of a dated and tired ""franchise"" that frankly never should have gotten past one sequel.Not a single frame entertained me, made me laugh or kept my interest. I FORCED myself to finish watching this cinematic turd. Is it ""meta"" to talk about how bad reboots are IN a bad reboot? Are you tired of hearing the word ""meta""?You know, I don't enjoy saying this but Wes Craven has gone the route of Romero and Carpenter. Once brilliant and innovative filmmakers that have become withered old men with nothing to say, who have seemingly lost all inspiration and just paint by the numbers.If you thought ""Scream 3"" was REALLY stretching plausibility then wow are you in for a treat in the misbegotten ""Scream 4."" Just about everything that happens will make any discerning viewer go ""Oh PLEASE.""It's not cute any more. The first film said and did everything it needed to and with every sequel you just made movies that you started out making fun of. It's a caricature of itself.The surviving characters from the first three films reprise their roles. Cox is looking very old, Campbell is as unconvincing as ever and Arquette still plays the cardboard cut out to perfection (not a compliment.) Campbell returns to the town where it all started to promote her new book, new murders take place and blah blah blah. If you've seen the first three, you have seen part 4. Reboot? More like repeat.LET THIS DIE.",0.2727272727272727,264,0.12693370461404996,0.0,0.16152389304368361,0.0,0.0,0.2571135650965365,0.15566519490048913,0.09774443948681005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045143076058745596,0.06050735893115255,0.0,0.0,0.0777298640258138,0.0,0.0,0.060050908429836444,0.21659901832214637,0.043814180327575454,0.058710339182871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062222450040792784,0.20589090430092494,0.0,0.0773062705333406,0.0,0.0,0.07715656304266909,0.12005922987385391,0.11810713623066565,0.0,0.10863274226557489,0.1761001183183397,0.0,0.24769710282200808,0.0589037086636157,0.0,0.0,0.14459899168401463,0.19107306382406747,0.0,0.0,0.07697798902253127,0.0,0.06249477938349787,0.0,0.15230892968475998,0.17544646735567881,0.0,0.051746517052707296,0.0,0.06441221784199341,0.0,0.1884154876249942,0.0,0.0,0.06985370863870506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21627597406277954,0.30482150967680083,0.0731286487390087,0.0,0.07903082687130951,0.0,0.0,0.10204175176153342,0.0,0.28057755825328556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06415113345253919,0.046962287131007696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061393381465547736,0.06776367315237805,0.09227968783334076,0.0,0.40500709434880244,

762055,B0000A9GHP,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,3,3,1253059200,Excellent horror anthology from Amicus,"I've been on a horror binge lately, and watched this Amicus gem for the first time tonight. ""The House that Dripped Blood"" is a horror anthology that reminded me of another Amicus production, ""From Beyond the Grave"", which was also an anthology. ""The House that Dripped Blood"" boasts an excellent cast, which helps move the stories along.A Scotland Yard inspector investigates the mysterious disappearance of a well-known horror movie actor [Jon Pertwee]. His last known address was a sinister manor in the English countryside. A constable tells the inspector that it is the house which is the problem, bringing misfortune to all who reside in it. In the first story, a horror writer with writer's block moves into the house with his lovely wife, and immediately his creative juices start flowing, creating a homicidal character which becomes all too real as the days pass by. In the second story, Peter Cushing plays a retired stockbroker, who is pining for a lost, dead love, only to discover to his horror that a life-like wax figure in the local waxworks bears an uncanny resemblance to her. When an old friend comes to visit, both men find themselves drawn to the wax figure, with predictably disastrous consequences. In the third story, Christopher Lee moves into the house with his beautiful young daughter, who turns out to have a fascination with the dark arts. At this point, the inspector has had enough, and goes to the real estate agent to get the keys to the house, only to be regaled with the last story, that of the movie actor who comes into possession of a sinister cape which makes him embrace the role of a vampire all too realistically. When the tales end, the inspector decides to visit the house himself, ignoring the dire warnings of the realtor.I liked this anthology, though I think I preferred ""From Beyond the Grave"", but both are wonderful horror anthologies that will satisfy the cravings of classic horror fans, especially fans of Cushing and Lee.

Thanks to those who do this.The 2.35:1 (or 2.40:1 - it is hard to tell the difference) video presentation was great to excellent.  I didn't see any grain at all.  I give it a 9.5 on a 10.0 scale.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master audio was disappointing.  I thought I heard sound from the surround speakers once during the movie, but I wasn't sure.  I think the ending music had some surround sound.  But during the movie, 99% of the sound came from the center or front speakers, and I couldn't hear any stereo separation coming from the front left and right speakers.  The sound just seemed to come from the center speaker.Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase, because of the great video quality.",1.0,133,0.0,0.0,0.08621533282813446,0.0,0.0,0.1543921618540977,0.0,0.0,0.09270027672737048,0.0,0.12499170681256475,0.0,0.0,0.14457397926527019,0.0,0.0,0.12063654070826105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3760482492879211,0.0,0.09415846101054105,0.19445817884930003,0.11503118912807314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05798404096121268,0.11279468338061995,0.0,0.09915849487321017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501363097604258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16856401566856122,0.07758922307957555,0.0,0.0,0.20628480510721287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058097401692141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10396012895028309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6833491141275301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446602000923297,0.0,0.22464250130199157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150400134831145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830838119531944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810665393964213,

270478,6301815807,A39AWL2FKWDFK6,1,1,1181001600,Eisenstein's incredible historical classic,"""Battleship Potemkin"", a vintage 1925 silent film still remains today a seminal offering in moviemaking history.  Sergei Eisenstein, skewing historical facts a tad chronicles the failed 1905 Russian Revolution which attempted to overthrow the yoke of Tsarism.  Tiring of oppressive rule and defeat at the hands of the Japanese in the Russo Japanese War, the proliteriat grew weary of the Tsarist regime.News of a worker's revolution had spread to the beleaguered crew of the Potemkin.  Unhappy with the squalid conditions aboard tempers began to percolate as the men were being forced to consume spoiled maggot infested meat.  As a group they refused to eat a meal of soup and were threatened by Captain Golikov with hanging.  When he ordered a group of protesters shot by the armed guard aboard the ship a mutiny ensued.  During the violence that followed, ringleader sailor Vakulinchuk was killed.The corpse of Vakulinchuk was brought ashore in Odessa were its was displayed in martyred fashion to the thongs of citizens of Odessa.  The sympathy of the massive crowds leaned towards the rebellious crew and against the Tsarist government.  Suddenly as a mass of people congregated, one of the most famous scenes in cinema history unfolded.  The superbly choreographed and photographed massacre on the steps of Odessa played out under Eisenstein's direction.  The Tsar's Cossack soldiers began shooting at the innocent people cheering for the Potemkin on the steps.  The moving scene with the baby carriage hurtling down the steps will forever be etched in any viewer's memory.The guns of the Potemkin blazed gainst the city in retaliation as she and her crew turned to meet a squadron of the Russian Navy ordered to engage her. They bravely steamed ahead to met their ultimate fate.",1.0,288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578262878156646,0.0,0.14085116852783047,0.08342196857182298,0.03958860982233502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08719199020150659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04326711917275657,0.0,0.03156843770156796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05175889750816791,0.0,0.0,0.04612797382120091,0.11139946779907581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985597981469974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05847493761202083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05492209915653721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42979557835190474,0.0698233700886614,0.037283744386823504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045251579424973515,0.11758586699488452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05921932289104775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031165684545511142,0.7467288399717147,0.052689726811214574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08770248919184272,0.0,0.0,0.22742795801950866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10151001510476516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16113687558539622,0.0,0.04718977705271575,0.05211033798094367,0.0,0.04882422262259942,0.09973228603298259,0.0,0.0,

He can play anything from a sweet Frank Capra movie to a bizarre Hitchcock flick like this.Get this: Stewart plays a pharmacist who drugs his own wife just to shut her up - but we still care about him because it's Jimmy!",0.3333333333333333,88,0.15270177536884194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15465434488432817,0.0,0.2351739356769099,0.0,0.0,0.18780594462436598,0.0,0.1835881953590295,0.10861461706709065,0.0,0.15470638192322192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14125756516743082,0.1727216137699594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1540363102658937,0.18599953091227212,0.19971016632560007,0.1496384105756366,0.18563933344256048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26137128286891564,0.25421901101810707,0.0,0.1489903232149604,0.14172281374898996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834027555366466,0.11279344924562125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215218454971133,0.08442513240707324,0.0,0.12450255110931083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407235906153965,0.14668061832682375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24551330480916386,0.0,0.33753597127101426,0.0,0.0,0.1597111884754705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18468833548494468,0.16106540926737659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14771298725095294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12180630537035612,

1467180,B005LAIH2C,A311626XD2C4T2,0,0,1398556800,Insufferable Bilge from the Sewage Treatment-Plant of Hell,"In the annals of truly execrable fantasy/action flicks, this piece of sewage rises above all the other festering floaters to achieve an incomparable stench. It is the pinnacle of bowl-swirling revulsion ... the triumph of the fecal over the feasible. If anyone doubts that our present society of lobotomized, nihilistic sociopaths is on the ascendency, gaze at the positive reviews for this wretched cinematic slap in the face of coherence and doubt no longer.To begin, the idea was actually outstanding: storybook faves Hansel and Gretel survive their gingerbread nightmares to grow-up and become avid witch-destroyers. So many reasonable, exciting, funny, ironic, satirical, scary and even MEDIOCRE things could have been done with that basic plot-line alone, but this Stew of Stool-Samples fails to even hit the level of mediocrity.The dialogue is ludicrously bad: it was clearly written by the kind of 21 year-old college graduates who emerge still utterly illiterate from their &#34;educational&#34; years, probably with degrees in Pole-Dancing or The Sociological Implications of XBox Character Motivation. Indeed, this ghastly piece of brain-sludge plays-out like a cheap video game from the early '90s, designed by bored Japanese gamers trying to approximate an American fairy tale after reading a synopsis translated from English into Sanskrit into Chinese into Japanese and then back into English.The action sequences are juvenile and just plain disconnected from any remotely purposeful trajectory. The entire pacing is arbitrary and dimwitted. The performances are colossally repugnant -- all of them. The CGI is half-baked. The witches look like diseased wax-figures in need of a free clinic. The story is a mangled piece of pork gristle. And Famke Janssen ... Oh, Famke J is looking awfully embarrassed, here, and deservedly so. Someone clearly needed a check and needed it bad. She sleepwalks through this travesty without even the decency to camp it up since it's obvious everyone is going down into the aqueduct that leads directly to Hell's Central Sewage-Treatment Plant, anyhow. But who can blame her? One hopes she was heavily sedated during the &#34;filming&#34; of this barrel of sun-burned fish-guts. I watched her hit her pathetic marks during this &#34;movie&#34; and truly imagined her fighting with the director -- screaming and begging and scratching her own face in anguish after seeing the rushes:&#34;PLEASE, can I do this whole movie in the cheap CVS Drugstore Halloween mask so the crowds of ill-bred millennial spawn drooling into their popcorn will never know it's ME?&#34;Too bad for you, Famke, and too bad for humanity. Our Entertainment Culture receives yet another nail in its already overloaded coffin.

It was an excellent season as all the prior ones and there has not ever been a series created with the humor and action as this series (I have never seen one like this remotely and is miles different then something like LaFemme Nakita), it truly is unique and puts you in the greatest moods after you watch the show.  Shaw is an issue during the ENTIRE season all the way through, Scott Baccula's character of Chuck's dad (he did an excellent job too as always) leaves the biggest mystery in the end of the finale and his character ends up giving you a ""JOLT"" with what he goes through and unleashes upon Chuck.  Chuck must step up to the plate to protect his loved ones and do something deeper in the very end as he also progresses through the series and as far as protecting family, ironically so does John Casey (Adam Baldwin).  The general's character even has a few bumps more than usual in the finale and everyone is left in a forced situation of change.  It leaves the staff of the Buy More in a real ""BANG for the BUCK"" so to speak, and literally leaves them in uncertain unstable ""explosive"" situations as well.  That is all I will say.  They did an excellent job with romance, action, and humor, it has been a fun ride.",0.8571428571428571,279,0.0,0.06532109695353167,0.13203808205103973,0.06039139492462917,0.19091671971407523,0.31526712269871887,0.0,0.3595563872940995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202684052432089,0.0,0.03690231252084143,0.0,0.052562200271561575,0.18475388237662776,0.0,0.0,0.058187035930838384,0.0,0.0,0.03581600361456671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15259165952026058,0.042076499648717736,0.1570036210912058,0.0,0.0,0.10168066769085443,0.0,0.0,0.28964085963840236,0.0,0.14800347971648828,0.14395345130411347,0.0,0.0,0.14445292094712492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412874695519583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08300352588036224,0.1434191228043836,0.03960908834193773,0.042300310720055904,0.05848326704751683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105606627410588,0.0,0.06852754494261276,0.09477539483455337,0.0,0.0,0.058776760441501215,0.03535905960519013,0.47343639891102873,0.0,0.0629662894785355,0.06460393324084474,0.05039286846773676,0.09950294973721555,0.08341426731262193,0.0,0.08600954159218835,0.06392595974421042,0.0,0.10852521233963026,0.05244049324753942,0.03838943084309819,0.060931941314071585,0.12898189048180955,0.0,0.054722708872697846,0.0,0.051851551241809395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055393572227445884,0.11315136817394321,0.0,0.1241527467249486,

This is shot video diary-style, allowing us to see their target-practice, bomb-making, and theft, along w/ many candid moments. Cal and Andre have had enough. There's no turning back. They have decided to carry out their plan no matter what. They take full responsibility / blame, making sure to point out that movies, video games, parents, etc., had nothing to do w/ their decision. Chilling in its realism, ZD offers a look inside the heads of these enigmatic men. Outwardly, they're each quite personable, w/ obvious intelligence and a sense of humour. Inside of them is a different story, and that's what the final 15 minutes is about.

The movie might best be described as ""ROCKY with a realistic ending"".Marisa Tomei is also marvelous as a stripper who is getting too old for that game and is trying to resist Randy's romantic advances.BE WARNED: It may all be fake, but the wrestling sequences in this picture are so brutal that you may find yourself turning away from the screen while they are in progress.  (I did.)  And, the crowds for those scenes are nothing short of sadistic.Bruce Springsteen wrote and sings the title song over the end credits.  It's a great number that didn't even get nominated for an Oscar.  Frankly, I think it was the best song of 2008.  It really brought the theme of the movie home. Michael B.

This mishmash has more ingredients than a Spanish paella.  A Spanish-made dubbed into English mess involving a werewolf, a couple of innocents that want to help him, and a pair of vampires putting the bite on everyone.  I don't know where the title of Frankenstein fits in but at one point the male vampire starts experimenting on the wolfman.  I'm not sure why, perhaps to make a better, more obedient monster.  Check out the beehive hairdo on the female vampire.  Other than that the picture is excellent and the color is magnificent.

One wouldn't think so, but Lasse Halsstrom (director) does so with stunning clarity.The film is about Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), a man broken apart by an unsatisfying marriage to a [witch] (played excellently by Cate Blanchett).  Before the marriage ends, they have a child, Bunny -- who is the highlight of her father's life -- and the mother is killed in a car accident. Coincidentally, Quoyle's ""mother"" and father were killed very recently, too.Enter Agnes Quoyle (Judi Dench), Quoyle's ""aunt"" who's heard about the death of her ""nephews"" parents and is there when news of the death of Bunny's mother arrives.  It is clear from the outset that Agnes doesn't want to hang around, but feels compelled to when she sees her ""nephew"" fall apart in front of his daughter.  She recommends that he and his child come with her to Newfoundland, to discover a new life for themselves....The trouble is, is that their old life also awaits them in Newfoundland.  Agnes is not -- exactly -- as she appears to be, nor is Quoyle's family.  Quoyle soon discovers his family lineage: Piracy and wickedness.  And he soon finds a new love interest who is just as broken as he is (Julianne Moore).A curse on their native house in Newfoundland, ghosts, a sixth-sense that some natives have (that comes alive in Quoyle's daughter, too, as the days slip past), homosexuality, incest, murder, family bonds, and a beautifully austere landscape round out much of the story.  Didn't I tell you this film had it all?  Well...now you'll just have to go and see it for youself!  And please do.A remarkable tribute to film making.A+ rating.",1.0,289,0.11258099324251433,0.0,0.0477533275251748,0.06552405222964126,0.05178567712200291,0.25654622781665803,0.0,0.17338446261876284,0.0,0.048732643907836534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08007727114195339,0.10733128112289374,0.0,0.06681869745175727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2130432082385769,0.0,0.07772000280592292,0.05207181432945367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06371398067897552,0.0,0.13695772869945802,0.1703473397404083,0.2742602288960427,0.0,0.1654837428950459,0.0,0.0,0.209504934033187,0.0,0.3853974658693695,0.12495043008905322,0.0,0.10984468602639462,0.0,0.06487505229237275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06368492823374733,0.0,0.0,0.045028992721702986,0.18672995591690686,0.08595091987938674,0.045895408980206075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05570362577218548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06124907597131821,0.0,0.21869276449948388,0.0,0.10283034410737747,0.057581893202437874,0.0601767251947985,0.0,0.19182110888919027,0.27035457938803803,0.12971961914375996,0.06831778675831945,0.0,0.05467575222599813,0.053979846662936766,0.030167878580002062,0.0,0.2799584461942443,0.13871803856616444,0.0,0.0,0.0568974043866403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05937358524003533,0.06611856300389879,0.0,0.11617900257274315,0.0,0.16335443493728047,0.0,0.0818453927896842,0.0,0.08980298237314265,

255451,6301562178,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,1,1,1345420800,"THEY DON""T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE","Now this is one mighty movie that fits into the ""they don't make them like this anymore"" category. Here is a disaster film of monumental proportions that would bankrupt several European countries if filmed today. The cost of making this film with modern special effects and a similar all-star cast would be phenomenal.Films buffs have to see this film and watch all the extra features on the making of THE TOWERING INFERNO.Sadly, modern audiences might not fully appreciate THE TOWERING INFERNO and its background story. We've gotten too sophisticated with all the computer generated special effects. Yes, they are incredible, but take a step back into the early 70's when specific effects required a lot of labor and often danger.PRODUCER/DIRECTOR IRWIN ALLEN was famous in the 60's for his sci-fi fantasty TV shows like LOST IN SPACE, THE TIME TUNNEL and LAND OF THE LOST. He took a different career path inthe 1970's with the disaster epic THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE to become the king of disaster films. He followed that huge success with THE TOWERING INFERNO.The world's tallest and news skyscraper is about to celebrate his official opening with a gala party. Many members of high society and the political world will be attending the party on the very top floor. Unfortunately, corners have been cut to save costs and many safety features are compromised. A small fire turns into THE TOWERING INFERNO.Again, you need to watch the special features to truly understand the undertaking it was to film this movie. Fire is unpredictable and yes, stunt actors were actually on fire in several scenes. The bravery of this cast and crew is amazing.Speaking of the cast, another fun part of this film is seeing actors who were in their heyday in the early 1970's along with famous actors like Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones from the past. The cast list is astounding--Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Robert Wagner and even O.J. Simpson. Who will survive the towering inferno? It's easy to draw comparisons with 9/11 and people trapped in a burning skyscraper. Fortunately, the people in our story have some chance for survival.Back to the special effects, it's still amazing to watch although some effects look cheesy by today's standards. Again, we have to remember that there were limitations on how realistic special effects could be. The crew of THE TOWERING INFERNO did an amazing job.This film is a step back in time. It's not as realistic in many ways as modern films, but considering the resources that were avalaible at the time, THE TOWERING INFERNO is an amazing achievement.",1.0,434,0.0365416001600864,0.0,0.09299880648483862,0.0,0.0672344932447072,0.24055753072197916,0.05975040622652693,0.05627722339718789,0.03333132987549225,0.09490600875698559,0.0,0.04297377829030734,0.0,0.05198304864262068,0.03483764573842393,0.0,0.0,0.04475365499440058,0.0,0.040983061934863806,0.20744904201119405,0.0,0.050452801759477556,0.03380299576391724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854350464975318,0.07372190986352889,0.0,0.0,0.0716170713095911,0.04442357189533471,0.034562580418791844,0.20400367709977632,0.1303055699202672,0.18763877935646278,0.08111295742984759,0.04672743806847577,0.0,0.10174298984544797,0.0,0.13702643924104047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05398304129804498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058462140020507175,0.22223267325300655,0.11159198572208395,0.0297935137332756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396309841640568,0.0,0.0,0.03976051693730252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07475984914546627,0.07812877707606956,0.0,0.12452280018872998,0.6142628573293417,0.0421044646982198,0.04434924893879539,0.0,0.035493370927907025,0.07008323222769096,0.1566705036078398,0.11362480603044087,0.22212438131847978,0.045025176579824404,0.0,0.0,0.036935581066773006,0.05407790229276918,0.12874916988318064,0.0,0.08839199535462386,0.0,0.17168639379426326,0.0,0.03770944398994375,0.0,0.07069556205929524,0.07803106534208559,0.18595795546734556,0.07942741052225745,0.029148300974692815,
1311977,B002ZG99B8,A1C58YXM2A30CY,0,0,1294963200,Green Hornet as a Comedy?,"First Impressions:The Green Hornet is based on the original radio serials of the 1930s, predating Batman, yet has enough similarity to make audiences get in tune.This movie was a lot of fun for the most part -- millionaire playboy whose Dad (and now Britt) works at the Daily Sentinel, and has a partner (Jay Chau, Kato) and pretends he is a criminal when he is actually fighting crime.On the Radio:So far, this aligns well with the radio show (except Kato in the radio show was Filipino -- but I digress), except the radio show was straight and this is a comedy. Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet is also the executive producer and the co-screenwriter so this is clearly his baby.I loved the fast cars, the incredible skill of Kato and the egocentric jerk that is Britt Ried! His egomania really gets on Kato's goat and they fight it out with each other -- a slapstick fight that was a bit boring I must admit.Lenore Love Interest:Catherine Diaz plays the secretary who through her criminology knowledge actually unwittingly helping them out with her explanation of gang profile. The subplot of a love triangle was not played up which is fine, since that was not the main theme anyway!The bad guy wants to control all of LA crime. He is paranoid and lives on a trigger. This guy is bloodthirsty and has no qualms about killing people who disagree with him.The impossible stunts, the over-the-top action and the crazy situations the Hornet and Kato get into is just as goofy a comic book-like movie as you can see. There's even panel shots!If you liked other similar films such as Rush Hour or even Lethal Weapon.End Credits Worth the Price!The ending credits play the original Green Hornet theme as composed by Billy May back in the 1930s, and we even listen to the singing of Jay Chau (Kato). Recommended for older teens and adults due to the over-the-top death by car and the gross methods of accidental and purposeful death!Fun film! A nod to Bruce Lee and coffee baristas everywhere, LOL!Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") directing from a screenplay by star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg based on the radio series created by George W. Trendle. The movie is played purely for laughs and should be taken that way.",0.0,390,0.03872649187483585,0.0,0.03285312728439657,0.04507895343952733,0.0,0.35299512363192603,0.0,0.14910536382380782,0.03532427342934595,0.033526873124502046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02754560695301098,0.14768261912089115,0.0392348774469939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13030055126813947,0.036642135742521495,0.044055123886150585,0.08020420598063752,0.03582414111756173,0.08760739233206985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139015305634004,0.0,0.11719482442557796,0.09434218174868902,0.050648226681381255,0.07589919209941519,0.0,0.03662914278241443,0.07206714820943994,0.04603226252322161,0.2651440780669228,0.021490713824034897,0.0,0.03778523548581247,0.03594213218459424,0.08926491455153958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04651252616386862,0.08581618488444664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04398434147474927,0.061957702469817987,0.19269849853857215,0.14783035326280794,0.0,0.0,0.03930333930586328,0.09002886452956183,0.07664547802375596,0.04979066531591007,0.0,0.04262365284696074,0.04213787380317278,0.052390765956785795,0.0,0.15345646569259763,0.07074477442178213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10557460403735656,0.650990800872524,0.0,0.04700097481114989,0.0,0.03761558702488075,0.03713682093200226,0.10377383171534295,0.0,0.10700255463073478,0.0,0.0,0.040504139705488426,0.0,0.17193396851049178,0.0,0.04813904897235993,0.04683856036551404,0.04084758181916267,0.0,0.0,0.03996416330657154,0.044131296799827135,0.07492258405987048,0.0,0.1126152771466405,0.0,0.061782266562846765,

For once Brosnan doesn't play a suave, drop dead gorgeous ladies man. Instead we see Brosnan play a successful, middle aged, psychopathic hitman with no home life, family, or friends to speak of! His career is all he has and he goes from country to country living from hotel to hotel assassinating those his employer wants him to eliminate.Near the start of this movie, we find both Brosnan's character  and Greg Kinnear's character in Mexico City, Mexico on business. Kinnear plays the role of a mild manner/straight-laced business/family man. Both men are going through a mid-life crisis of sorts as Kinnear's character is on a new business venture and Brosnan's character begins to realize that he is a VERY LONELY middle-aged man with no place to call home.The two begin to form a unique friendship during their time in Mexico City. Brosnan's character later reveals to Kinnear's character that he is an assasin, which Kinnear's character doesn't believe. By the end of their stay in Mexico City, the two are no longer speaking to each other as Brosnan's character has no social skills to maintain a friendship.In the end, Brosnan's character shows up at Kinnear's home in Denver in need of help! He has been failing at his job miserably and is about to be assassinated by his employer for failing to do his job. So, Kinnear comes to the rescue and helps his friend out. I don't want to spoil the ending, so your on you own!

558514,B00004Y7GM,A2NJO6YE954DBH,5,6,1173225600,Apparently for every act of pleasure there is a corresponding act of perversion,"It has been a while since I have checked out an offering from the friendly folks at Something Weird Video, and given that it is one of the few films in their collection to appear on a DVD without a second feature film I was inclined to believe that ""The Curious Dr. Humpp"" is one of the crowned jewels in their collection.  ""La venganza del sexo"" (""The Revenge of Sex"") is a 1971 Argentinean film from writer-director Emilio Vieyra (""Sangre de v&iacute;rgenes""), known in the U.K. as ""The Curious Case of Dr. Humpp,"" and as you might suspect, this film is really something weird.It begins with a shadowy figure, first seen only as shoes and claws, goes around abducting a couple of lesbians, a drunken sailor outside of a bar, a young woman whose wall is covered with beefcake photos, a quartet of pot smoking hippies, and a stripper (Gloria Prat).  The police are baffled by the string of kidnappings, which means it will be up to reporter George Foran (Richard Bauleo), who thinks the crimes are similar to something that happened in Italy thirty years earlier, which were done by some mad scientist studying sexual aberration.  To the police this sounds like a wild leap in logic, but of course it is just a way of working in exposition.  Indeed, Dr. Humpp (Aldo Barbero) has taken all of these people prisoner.  I doubt I can improve on the description that Netflix provides on the sleeve for this DVD, so I will simply quote it: ""With help from aphrodisiacs and clever inculation by a talking, pulsating, disembodied brain in a jar, Humpp turns his 'guests' into sex machines, using an elixir derived from their orgasms to stoke his genius and stay eternally young.""  So you have your science fiction, you have your horror, and you have your sex machines, thereby making ""The Curious Dr. Humpp"" a true triple-threat exploitation film.When his film was brought to the U.S., Vieyra added an additional 15 minutes of sex footage, which is enough to make it seem like this is a soft core porn film with the science fiction bit thrown in to provide a veneer of legitimacy as opposed to a science fiction-horror film that has found a way to make sex a necessary part of the science.  After all, Dr. Humpp is not just a voyeur, even though at one point her literally says: ""Put the lesbians in one room.  I want to observe them.""  He does indeed observe them, but in addition to making him hot and bothered the sight opens up some lesions on his hand.  His nurse (Susan Beltran) brings him the aforementioned elixir, but the stuff is not working as well as it used to, which means he needs more aphrodisiacs to keep his ""guest"" going to produce more orgasms and a more potent, so to speak, elixir.For me the problem is not so much the sex, because compared to what we have on late night cable these days what Vieyra is shooting works fine, unencumbered by either hysterical moaning or cheesy music.  Ultimately, it is the talking brain in the jar that strikes me as being unnecessary.  The weird looking automaton is bad enough, but it never speaks and therefore fits the tone of the rest of the film.  But the ranting brain is just over the top and I think the story, such as it is, works just fine without the brain of the Italian scientist from thirty years earlier floating in a jar.  Otherwise this weird mix of soft core and sci-fi horror is rather compelling, especially when compared to the usual SWV offerings.  It might be a while before my next SWV rental simply because I strongly suspect that after this one everything I have left to check out in their catalog is going to be strictly bottle of the barrel movies.The ""Supplements"" on this DVD start out with the original title sequences for ""The Curious Dr. Humpp,"" along with the American theatrical trailer.  Then there is the trailer and a TV spot for ""The Deadly Organ,"" which is the U.S. version of Vieyra's 1967 film ""Placer sangriento.""  Next we have a trio of film shorts: ""Rasputin and the Princess"" is the basic stripper and the gorilla routine that we have seen on several SWV offerings, but this time the guy is wearing a black leotard and a mask.  ""The Girl and the Skeleton"" is a naked woman and one of those cardboard skeletons you hang up for Halloween and I would say use your imagination on this one because once you see it you will not have to.  Then there is ""My Teenage Fallout Queen,"" which is a parody of a folk song and I have no clue why it is included with the other two because the only thing they have in common is that there is a man (I assume it was a male skeleton) and a woman in each.  Go figure.  There is also another stellar edition of the Gallery of Exploitation Art Featuring Horrorama Radio Spot Rarities! (forget going to the drive in for a movie; go to see a man buried alive!).",0.8333333333333334,864,0.0,0.05123509162623794,0.03452168619096237,0.023684221459116257,0.05615510962612463,0.21637186280701232,0.03326953621503134,0.12534255347458464,0.037118337980287325,0.05284447579140997,0.10009645239455722,0.023928166575231866,0.0,0.08683381563097689,0.07759159408200712,0.02061377772717061,0.0,0.0,0.07175832062417811,0.02281971871581162,0.19251566228685235,0.02314630733227008,0.08427765205091742,0.09410898291473967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059843205499762825,0.18151659700247522,0.041048988700549564,0.024783418369168506,0.05322057082991288,0.11963098988058973,0.0,0.0,0.20193953560867184,0.024185084538989907,0.3366541496393592,0.16936645153233312,0.0,0.07940857689443505,0.037767576814520025,0.0,0.0,0.04635661870558475,0.06125562191993728,0.0,0.015029109096378727,0.024678175444252843,0.0230194545753944,0.040070081059779855,0.023109118662633196,0.06510443718981734,0.28122965781884274,0.12427074039338905,0.11612497934407824,0.04587178852665093,0.020649747191926273,0.023650322407011013,0.06040363640394771,0.026159727632556983,0.0,0.022394220726045643,0.04427799045110671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433779077095984,0.041626922152558275,0.021751384990704985,0.0,0.1248036445239473,0.5179263006176588,0.09377650138686633,0.049388080746592025,0.05067257889690231,0.07905204761304477,0.019511470966622962,0.09813990796276632,0.021089087298831775,0.2698489125093138,0.0,0.02569908127405553,0.06384192233406676,0.0,0.04516655640652675,0.0,0.05058395591291129,0.07382612628825828,0.021461083278524393,0.02389911239394425,0.040670152565358025,0.041993880601104434,0.13911796884378433,0.019681946205158313,0.06517254488079384,0.10354297693707329,0.02211293008467639,0.1136101595435765,

The worst part of this movie is the weirdest justaposition of costuming I have ever seen in any movie!  King Ahasures wears clothing -- and crowns -- more suitable for King Arthur!  His evil cousin looks like someone dressed straight out of the court of Louis XIV!  Esther-Hadassah, and the other aspirants for queenhood, are dressed in clothing that could easily be mistaken for 19th century party dresses.  And Queen Vashti, is dressed in one scene in a dress that could have come from the court of Louis XVI, (without a petticoat), and in another, with a head-gear that could easily have been from Outer Space -- or somewhere. A little research on the part of the costume designer could have gone a long way in making this film look, and feel, more realistic!  (More on the bad costuming to come.....)The best part of this film?  The Music!  Melodic without getting maudlin, the music echos the best ""movie spectacular"" music of past.  The themes sounded timeless....most could have been used in any spectacle film.  There is just a tiny touch of what we have come to expect as ""ancient Hebraic""....but it is generalized, far more, into the genre of ""general grand movie heroic"" ....which is good -- because I, for one, find myself exteremely embarrassed at the maudlin tone too-often given ""Jewish"" music offered in most films.  Thankfully -- and beautifully -- a ""grand movie heroic"" score more than sufficed here.This movie, indeed, tries hard to be good, in all departments.  You can tell that everyone involvedin it was very dedicated to bringing The Bible's Book of Esther to life.Tiffany Dupont was truly excellent and very, very believable as thegirl-into-woman queen, and, as Xerxes, Luke Goss was almost as credible.Omar Sharif, as always, was truly a standout, in believability of character, and acting.  Unfortunately, (as always), John Ryhs-Daviscomes across as trying just a bit too hard, (except in the very beginning scenes when Ms. Dupont -- as Hadassah -- dances around their modesthome, and Mr. Rhys-Davis, it seemed, could not help but be caught up inthe believabilty of the moment she has created.  Mr. Rhys-Davis is a fineactor -- if only he didn't try so hard, which leads to over-acting, if only just slightly.  Relax, please Mr. Rhys-Davis -- just pretend you arethe character and don't try so hard.  You don't have to try that hard....your very considerable screen presence does that for you; just relax, and ""go with the flow"", as they say.Peter O'Toole, at the beginning, in an important cameo part, also over-acts a bit.  But his part, though prominent, is too miniscule to notice the over-acting very much.The script was more at fault in the unbelievability of the story than any of the actors, however.  Firstly, we are treated to the ludicrous idea Hadassah's Uncle Mordechai is finally allowing his neice to travel, on her own, back to Judea, as is now permitted Jews of the Persian Empire to finally do.  Jews -- yes.  Young girls -- NO!  We'ere still in Biblical times, here, don't forget!  Young women were VERY closely guarded -- especially one so beloved by her uncle as Haddassah!  She is NOT a 20th or 21sr century woman, don't forget!  Hadassah appears to be about 17 when the movie begins -- and for a well-brought-up, 17-year-old girl to be given permission by her uncle/guardian to trapse, (all by herself!) to Jerusalem from Shushan, is about as believable as that same Uncle/Guardian to ask her to become a ""loose woman""!  Because, in those days, it could easily have evolved into the very same thing!  It's true that, a little LATER on in the film, her could-be boyfriend, Jessie, did offer to go with her.....but this was totally of his OWN idea, and was not, (incredibly), even mentioned by Mordechai!  (We're NOT talking about a 20th or 21st-century career girl here.  Yes, Mordechai taught Hadassah to read -- unusual enough.  But....going to Jerusalem....alone?????  NICE girls just didn't do that.....Then!It was also truly heart-breaking, just a little later on, to see Hadassah's beginning-to-be-boyfriend, (at the start of the movie), turnedforcibly into a palace servant....and more.....  He starts out as avery handsome guy, with an, (OK, slightly incongruous), fine head of very blonde hair, a mischievous, carefree manner, and colorful clothes...and winds up with a scarf on his head, hiding his hair, (or is that a new, forced baldness), wearing olive-drab palace servant garb.  He and Hadassahhad wanted to go to live in Jerusalem... But on the day, (with Hadassah'sUncle Mordechai's consent), they were about to do this.....Hadassah iscaptured to be a candidate in the new-queen contest, while poor Jesse is also captured....and more of him is taken off than his hair!  I don't know....but it really seemed to me that before this, Haddassah and Jesse were beginning to fall in love....and then this queen-thing had to happen.  If I had been Haddassah-Esther, I would have found it VERY difficult indeed to fall in love with a king....no matter how kind or how handsome....if his orders had completely ruined the life, (and manhood), of the boy I was beginning to like....  Jesse does wind up as the Queen's ally, which is nice to see.  But -- to make the story more believable, and Xerxes' and Esther's love more real -- I would have eliminated the character of Jesse altogether.  Or make him fall in love with, or be promised to, someone else.  As it is, having the movie turn Jessie into an unwilling servant makes Esther -- even with all the believabilty Tiffany Dupont puts into the character -- seem awfully fickle.....Persian men -- especially Persian rulers -- mostly wore beards.  LONG, artificially curling beards.  Today's audience, however, usually does not find long, curling beards on men as attractive.  I was wondering how this situation would be handled.  Well, it was handled giving Xerxes a mustache, and just a small beard.  OK --- but they weren't curling, after the manner of the real Ancient Persians.  This -- plus his long straight hair, and pointed crown, made him look more like King Arthur than Xerxes!SOMETHING more should have been done!I noticed that Haman's amulet, the Aggite symbol, resembled a swastika insome respects.  I don't know if this was accurate, but it speaks volumes to a modern audience.  However, although known as Aggites, Haman's ancestral people are better known as the AMALIKITES.  Both ancestral names could have been used...but in this movie, only the word ""Aggite"" described this ethnic group.  And -- in the Bible, at least in the Jewish versions -- Xerxes is known as ""Ahasures"".  Surely -- at least at the beginning of the movie, within the Hebrew quarter of the city -- he should have been referred to, at least once, as ""Ahasures"".  But no, the king is always called ""Xerxes"", (his Greek name!), throughout the movie.And the capital city of the Persian Empire was always ""Shushan"", as far as I know.  Here, for some unfathonable reason, it is always ""Suzhan"".Not as big a blunder, in my estimation, as the costuming-from-King-Arthur's-day-masquerading as Biblical garb, or the non-curling, even a little, of King Ahasure's (who????) beard....but still adding to the non-believability of the action on-screen.The King's evil cousin wears a hairstyle that would be at home in the court of Louis XIII.  Vashti's clothes seem right out of the court of Louis XV....and her hairstyle, in one crucial scene, seems from outer-space, or somewhere.  These multi-century costumes had me thinking of the fantasy TV series, ""Dinotopia"", where people from many centuries come together, co-existing with each other and with dinosaurs.  Not a bad show -- but should NOT be something one is reminded of, via costuming, watching a movie version of The Book of Esther!  A real no-no, that could SO easily have been prevented by a little historical costume research.  (Strangely, Omar Shariff's costumes...although perhaps not 100% authentic...did NOT look out of place at all.  Dark and/or flowing, theytook one immediately to Ancient Persia, especially when he was bareheaded, and did not have to wear the only slightly incongruous headgear given him.  As for most of the other costumes....a real mix-up, or, as the Yiddish expression goes, ""Kasha & Borsht""  (don't mix!)The towering scenery takes one's breath away.  However, I'm not sure it is accurate.  I DO know, however, that the SEWING of cloth into clothingdid not take place until about the 1400s.  Before then, people mostly draped their garments.  Too many costumes in this Biblical epic came across as looking as if they were from the 14th century....A.D, NOT B.C!The diadems of the Biblical periods I have seen are mainly ciclets, some gold, and some with jewels....but NOT with points!  Xerxes looked too much like King Arthur in too many scenes!  And Esther-Hadassah's dresses looked far too much like party-dressees from the 1890s, instead of the draped robes people wore in biblical times!  This mis-juxtapositioning of clothing styles takes a LOT away from the believabilty of the movie!The script was creditable in most scenes.  But in other scenes, credulity was strained by stilted dialogue.  And embarrassing dialogue. The last scene, wherein Mordechai, newly made a minister-advisor to the King, decribes himself as, ""I, Mordechai, Prince of Persia....a Jew"", is truly embarrassing to those who, like myself, were taught in Hebrew School that Jews are no better, and no worse than anyone else, and that the only reason Jews are called ""The Chosen People"" is because they were chosen to help God give the world The Ten Commandments.  But that happened 5,000 years ago....and today, every Human Being is pretty much the same, with only God above everyone!  (One God = everyone is equal -- get it????)It was nice, however, to see Haman lump together the ""democracy"" ideal of the Greeks, (the enemy of the Persians), with the ""one God"" idea of the Jews, (who were the enemy of Haman).  If the villian of a film puts two groups together as his enemies, then they are, per force, both good-guygroups, and have a lot in common!  As in Tiffany Dupont's delightful and realistic portrayal of, not just a Jewish girl....but a Human one....this putting together of ""Jews"" and ""Greeks"" -- even by Haman, the bad guy, should help to bring ALL people together, as good guys....and for all of us ""good guys"" to see more similarity than differences in each other.This movie is a LOT better than the truly awful 1961 epic, Esther And The King, which is full of hackneyed dialogue, and which actually OMITS the climactic scene wherein Queen Esther, risking her life for her peoples', enters the King's throne-room unannounced.  Mordechai, melodramatically, appears in chains in once scene in ""Esther and The King"", and, although the stars in that 1961 movie, (Joan Collins and Richard Eagan), try real hard, nothing could save it, with that hackneyed dialogue and script.  ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING is certainly an improvement.....but the BEST version I have read of this story, (and there are many book versions), isGladys Malvern's true classic ""BEHOLD YOUR QUEEN"", (also reveiewed by mefor Amazon.)  Now, THAT book would make the PERFECT ""Purim"" movie....and I do hope someone buys the rights to it soon, and makes a movie of it.In the meantime, despite it's many flaws and inadequacies, ""One Night With The King"", seems to be the best ""Purim"" movie we have, at least so far....P.S.  I'm looking forward to seeing other movies with TIFFANY DUPONT them!If there is one spark of true vitality, and even more important, truebelievability in ""One Night With The King"".....Ms. DuPont is it!!!!!",0.75,1930,0.04716519427594453,0.011876697611135783,0.048014391882919796,0.04392151199449334,0.0347125240497273,0.2531719207827636,0.06169712339677869,0.2469708210619202,0.09464755272799283,0.10616463460417282,0.03480471858165278,0.07765432356918682,0.04536409811851085,0.12748215998570095,0.07194536953700434,0.009556871937490392,0.055986659129732635,0.0808705900226322,0.0,0.05289790457212282,0.04462664618750425,0.0,0.06512074420185568,0.07853473136351483,0.010669749515927416,0.04369834902283789,0.0,0.04270820059786558,0.009248084118942217,0.14535682707761688,0.047577393790556845,0.10340984694604545,0.04934778928863771,0.1016818194521385,0.03440319618783597,0.0713773151909577,0.24575866464105345,0.0784881020630667,0.16146017038621352,0.10469460501770578,0.0,0.0828338998734773,0.05252892989089789,0.04348648000915056,0.05895453035655368,0.021491658360146364,0.1325289972954949,0.04531827648885101,0.13238690086424929,0.011441190716866048,0.04268872641581885,0.009288560260073624,0.07499625900650364,0.12073376884536183,0.28684149469429726,0.06481560600584364,0.10767473784024348,0.0638006503652666,0.10530902742496312,0.06578797118577073,0.03733876926468606,0.07276836983871685,0.0,0.01038231334650599,0.041055947142855986,0.012761396837098957,0.02443203819112958,0.012459694758278635,0.04308021289916245,0.028948344847013547,0.03025285373265988,0.07480763337084385,0.13500884775278643,0.4983597490932078,0.021738131320754833,0.011448545947778579,0.046985210927327034,0.027487330516271596,0.05427495099870906,0.09099841327201372,0.0,0.25542516826065176,0.08136123398947362,0.01191449873467792,0.04933020074123246,0.09534743137012797,0.11865958485808016,0.0,0.01172575922641683,0.0570449243475243,0.01989939226542981,0.0775600337376758,0.009427661559409665,0.029203536419287565,0.053747734081891686,0.027374580513984823,0.0,0.13715472711103013,0.05125951287991729,0.03009797649281354,

Sadly, the same cannot be said for this sequel. Rob Zombie tries too hard to go out with a bang, and in doing so, skips a good storyline and real scares in exchange for an attempt at shock value and gore. This movie could be classified under the 'torture porn' category (this is not a good thing). Rent it if you must, but don't spend the money buying it. I'll sum it up for you: Michael Myers kills everyone (some while not fully clothed), and the 'surprise' ending isn't really a surprise (as it's alluded to for most of the movie).",0.0,134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203446491068781,0.2026394264819654,0.0,0.15407103979108702,0.09125170613505115,0.17321711542650414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07115740500693775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12252278529760267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11380574399196414,0.2762508580991832,0.0,0.0,0.27806131278977103,0.0,0.11323366700998382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2838675603487083,0.12411201688365964,0.0,0.057077959776500826,0.22206421954305702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12015384768192254,0.2216853320527515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600527204016563,0.16592996877419378,0.0,0.08156617122914377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09899751584690696,0.0,0.0,0.11010788521306365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09137599643824403,0.2046712150522045,0.0,0.0,0.06818160578879615,0.3843833342800526,0.0,0.0,0.124573446178032,0.0,0.0,0.16084473836616534,0.0,0.11056607508594246,0.12326613421332162,0.0,0.10463263628198911,0.0,0.07402496190300756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272857428374893,0.0,0.3191990484405372,
1550848,B008DCAG9M,A2N1GYD8Y22WG8,26,32,1347494400,Five Stars to Universal for Delaying Set to Correct Major Issues,"Original Review (Posted 9/13/12, see edit)""Issues with set! Shoddy Work by Universal!1 STAR: Hopefully Universal wil have the decency to delay this set and--if that happens--I will remove this review. Until then, I will leave this up as a warning to those considering purchasing this set. Essentially, several films in the set have been the victims of botched digital encoding. This has left them looking ""digitized"" and of worse quality than the previous DVD editions. As if this was not horrific enough, Universal has redone the title credits on Frenzy, misspelling many of the words. This is likely just the tip of the iceberg, and this does not bode well for the set having effective packaging--others issues will certainly arise. Please fix these issues Universal! Otherwise, Hitchcock fans will be paralyzed in suspense waiting to receive this collection only to discover that the true horror of this set is not ""Psycho"" or ""Frenzy"", but the shoddy product passed off by Universal as a $300 set!Specific issues as per noted by respected film enthusiast and expert Nick Wrigley (a founder of the British ""Masters of Cinema"" collectors label)'1.) The credits on FRENZY, and if at all possible a new FRENZY encode without DVNR (it's the only film in the entire box that has this level of paralyzing DVNR, and it's lazy). If they're redoing the credits they'll have to do a new encode anyway. Turn the DVNR box off.2.) MARNIE and TORN CURTAIN have really fuzzy, crap encodes. The films look like DVDs playing through a 1080p fuzz filter. I'd redo both encodes.3.) FAMILY PLOT is a bit of a mess. Don't really know what's happened to this one. Parts look awful, parts look okay. Look into this and try and redo?'""EDIT (9/14/12): Universal has delayed the boxset to Oct. 30th, and is correcting these issues. 5 Stars to Universal for doing the correct thing!",0.8125,314,0.0,0.0,0.04515971586307272,0.0,0.0,0.269569457933718,0.0,0.1639674860941792,0.048556538844215326,0.04608584293888207,0.0,0.06260350074931384,0.0,0.03786402957945087,0.1522527458272151,0.0,0.06318959426798465,0.06519639616161971,0.06258066986788778,0.0,0.10073612928376083,0.0,0.07349882040664864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20875783349673213,0.17269224809681114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20140081838082943,0.09906307877563854,0.0632756777790946,0.12148849762587155,0.059082018073144955,0.0,0.05193936283712679,0.049405843861329374,0.0,0.06653929545711763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12775004103161916,0.26488222463301764,0.08128269423479564,0.04340270587160587,0.1200148176155335,0.054026139434394625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171804458645376,0.0579224739110023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06030855097995235,0.1088416731094844,0.511341789993917,0.0,0.06460726400214149,0.06628758666001448,0.0,0.10209611199744495,0.37088193935600705,0.0,0.23533613330220435,0.0,0.0,0.0556767526130399,0.0,0.03938990392974455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05614884612592469,0.0,0.05320286279759458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22734877183069657,0.03870007468207515,0.0,0.0,

345597,6302919649,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,2,2,1221177600,Masterpiece,"Ikiru (To Live), by Akira Kurosawa, is sort of a `lost' film. No, it was never really lost, but it is unlike the archetypal Kurosawa film Western audiences think of him making, and thereby lost in his canon. It is not some historical epic filled with honor, samurais, and swordplay. It is more in line with the genre of retrospective life films in the vein of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, in that we drop in the on the life of an ordinary man- in this case lifelong low level Tokyo city bureaucrat office head Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a few months before his death by stomach cancer, and witness how this `living mummy', as his co-workers chide him (one of the nicer things they say about him), reclaims meaning in a life long since blanched of it. Unlike Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate, or Isak Borg, a renowned Academic, Watanabe is the sort of man most people would ignore.His devotion to his work life only accentuates his forgetability, for he seems somehow pleased with himself and his existence (or maybe just narcotized), merely rubber stamping projects here and there, or assisting his underlings in giving grieving citizens the bureaucratic runaround. Yet, as soon as we, and he, get confirmation of his cancer (although his doctors, in Japanese tradition deny it, and Kurosawa deftly skewers this absurd tradition in a hilarious scene where another stomach patient- played by Atsushi Watanabe- tells Watanabe exactly what horrors to expect from the doctors and the disease, and is right) something within Watanabe shifts. A mere month shy of setting the all time record for perfect attendance, he skips out of work for a few days. The non-news of his impending demise has shattered all his desires for conformity.... This is a great film, and Shimura (a veteran of the Godzilla films I loved in my youth, as well a Kurosawa regular film player) gives a great performance. The way he imposes his will on the gangsters, bureaucrats, and politicians to get the park built shows smart subversion at its best, and possibly enough to make up for the years of living death between his wife's death and his graves-edge rebirth. Like Rashomon, which preceded it in the Kurosawa canon, Ikiru deals with perspective, but not the perspective of many on one event, but the perspective of many on many things: life, a man, a park, accomplishment. It is, in that way, something like Rashomon 2. It is one of the many reasons this is such a great film. Another is that while the first two thirds of the film, while Watanabe lives, is great, there have been Hollywood films that come close to it- in construction and true sentiment. But, no Hollywood film has ever done what the last third of this film does, craft a stage play that can basically stand alone as an existential debate on life and art, purposiveness and meaning. This daring and depth is what soars Ikiru past lesser films. Even Citizen Kane, as great and influential a film as that is, was not as daring narratively, as this film, for the themes of the film, while profound, are not really original. It's all how the film presents these issues, starting with the film's first shot of an X-Ray of Watanabe's stomach cancer. Despite all that is to occur, Kurosawa never lets us forget that all of what occurs is due to a few cells in a man's stomach that forgot how to behave. Without the cancer, Watanabe remains a mummy for years more, and the slum children have no park to relieve, however briefly, their misery.Yet, even more profound than the philosophy of the film, is its realism. By the end of the film, we see that Watanabe's co-workers truly are bureaucratic scum. They talk the talk at his wake, but refuse to walk Watanabe's walk. Watanabe's victory is small, and temporal. Likely, the gangsters will find another way to corrupt that area, and with Watanabe gone there is no one left in his office who will care. Kurosawa has shown us victory, but acknowledges it may be Pyrrhic, at best. It is also the greatest artistic indictment of bureaucracies ever made, and not just of Post-War Japan's problems, nor even Japan's for the three tenets of Japanese bureaucracy- be punctual, never take off, and do nothing, are universal, even if only codified in Japan. We see this most eloquently in the scenes of Watanabe skipping work, for the office work comes to a halt and the mountain of paperwork continues to bloat.Some believe that the famed Tolstoy story, The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, is the basis for this film, since both involve petty bureaucrats who die, but Ikiru is the far greater work of art, for it about life, not merely its waste. Ilyich cannot cope with life, while Watanabe, however, acts upon his demise's coming, but why he does, is a bit of a mystery. We can only assume his motives, for Kurosawa keeps much of his motivation a secret, as Watanabe spends quite some time `offstage', even when alive. Perhaps the only flaw in the film is in the subtitling, with white subtitles almost blanched out in some of the shots, but that's not anything Kurosawa had control over. That which he did shows mastery, something he never seems to have lost.",1.0,903,0.0359958196061576,0.0,0.07634149040980528,0.020950179031036766,0.049672715744767615,0.218736549184902,0.04414348648873482,0.13859168539869282,0.04925024624710004,0.031162835013524567,0.0,0.021165963783142346,0.04327656011858039,0.1152149324323759,0.06863463044912085,0.03646835802778689,0.021364119382130266,0.0,0.0,0.10092736072397639,0.289496697911544,0.04094872051044833,0.1490977359614695,0.016649059323279473,0.040715021395988864,0.0,0.08609389251750142,0.020371440052676097,0.052935067811932884,0.043789857896484326,0.1270864158787775,0.0,0.07061539824806964,0.35273704056304117,0.0656401008658727,0.01702317912225774,0.23444948904783203,0.0,0.24644830816549082,0.13982756361263038,0.06904428476046702,0.03512093284151252,0.033407789958325766,0.0,0.08998655352778151,0.0,0.0541844387030179,0.04323284708133396,0.0,0.0,0.02036215103729764,0.01772224967241687,0.0817658581798624,0.10078067501999267,0.3482713741060641,0.06870328902448695,0.05869704342876438,0.08115294680605087,0.07306398504393086,0.0,0.03562053605949726,0.023139919471335584,0.0,0.03961818498286551,0.03916665906398915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07364324583035435,0.01924046397365848,0.02039005152390709,0.17172812153640366,0.4235618154220517,0.0207377989640748,0.0,0.0,0.052444869882746215,0.034518239125169846,0.09645655842874032,0.03730924026988684,0.14918642771727741,0.0,0.022732448881801554,0.0188240611989018,0.0,0.026635100913508177,0.0,0.06711702140829659,0.1088397301115151,0.01898367390548172,0.0,0.07195060043959095,0.01857311033676569,0.0410195223395538,0.03481983120188974,0.057649202677733144,0.10467457817169236,0.019560273280439744,0.0,

26239,0780022181,A2C9DBEEKV54R2,2,43,1175126400,Don't understand any of the hype,"I just made it through 45 minutes of this ""classic"" and had to stop.  This is a frenetic, loud, short-attention-span mess.  The best science fiction (""Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Silent Running,"" ""The Fly"") appeals to the inellect.  I'm at 45 minutes and it has failed to engage my thinking on any level.  It's just entertainment, pure and simple, and pretty unpleasant entertainment at that, aimed at a pretty simple-minded audience, I have to say.  The set-ups, like the oh-so-sweet Christmas scene at the beginning are just out of place in this film.  The arrest of Buttle was so ridiculously overdone that I thought I was watching a cartoon version of ""The Terminator.""  The set-ups seem extremely heavy handed, as is the constant reminders of hte ""Tuttle-Buttle"" mixup.  The use of the classic songs in this film ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Brazil,"" is just a travesty.  The goal seems to be to ruin the value of these songs rather than add anything meaningful to the film.  Besides, there are more guns in the first 45 minutes of this film than in most Westerns.  What's that all about?  Was the NRA a major funder for this studio?  You know when a film starts with an explosion that it's going to be pretty bad, unless it's James Bond, which this isn't!",0.046511627906976744,220,0.06288272872665662,0.0,0.053345763864282046,0.0,0.05785034565069732,0.15921699653245092,0.10282167637952018,0.09684483867349204,0.2294332996340605,0.10887953778798266,0.0,0.0,0.07560178431647689,0.0,0.05995047334674511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29749111916841736,0.07153517579918411,0.04341093209714422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07117558386611333,0.06164977944226846,0.050998991646100646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560268337104462,0.0,0.10763292985877025,0.17447936310713452,0.0,0.24541739753825878,0.0583615824362881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06310483453260346,0.07552542003048311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191960237438411,0.0,0.0,0.2781307649393213,0.04800835578825779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622271288898305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11487290078252921,0.0,0.0,0.14248122062274868,0.17142836504690293,0.5436288974690838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06107888012227926,0.0,0.235906067135677,0.06517720281295143,0.2779952343796344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13959019494569963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284688248061014,0.0648924164914588,0.07165886272343541,0.0,0.0,0.04571519120668779,0.0,0.05015994633526237,
83385,078886047X,A1RHBDGMYEH2Z0,8,19,1112400000,The Sins are in the details,"Sin City is a interesting failure in that it portrays a stunning grim and grimey metropolis, but populates it with supermen and women who are as out of place there as Clark Kent is in Batman's suit.  Even Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the most vulnerable character whose heart condition that acts up at the most inopportune times, can survive a myriad of bullets and still live to tell the tale.  I even might have looked away from these points if the stories made up for them.  Well, they don't.  There is no mystery in them; they just blame some sort of authority power whether it's government, police, religion, etc, for all the problems the characters are having at the time.Okey dokey, how about the characters; they have to be sympathetic and interesting, don't they?  Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan are the best and deserve better stories.  Dwight (Clive Owen) is a typical tough guy character who isn't given as much to chew on as the other two except for perhaps Rosario Dawson's lips.  Why, though, is he given the power to jump pretty high off the side of a building to chase after Jack (Benicio Del Toro)?  Because if he didn't, he wouldn't have missed the key bit of information that Shellie (Brittany Murphy) was going to tell him about Jack.  Did she say ""stop"" or something important I needed to know?  Oh well, off to whoretown!  That's just lazy storytelling and gives off the clue that there really isn't a very good story being told in the first place.The visuals though are completely brilliant, and it's probably worth the price of admission just to see them.  Even though I've only seen samples of his work online, I can see Miller is a wonderful artist, and his visual work translates wonderfully on the big screen.  There's tribute here to all the great film noirs of the 30's, 40's, and early 50's, and I'm sure Rodriguez and Miller screened several of them to the crew for inspiration.  It's a pity though that this one isn't that good.2.5/5",0.42105263157894735,345,0.09403413295805367,0.059196987281241044,0.07977266180302325,0.0,0.0,0.2857095903619924,0.15375839095136293,0.14482069433898434,0.08577300094822594,0.040704312376740236,0.057825683835251496,0.0,0.056527033592834904,0.033442575627574855,0.0,0.0952685746586026,0.0,0.11516658070981356,0.0,0.15819531758849578,0.0444864909971131,0.053486453025269935,0.12983244980987768,0.04349337993026196,0.0,0.08712221851605387,0.04498169301016396,0.0,0.0,0.11439498710422154,0.1422839142988764,0.0,0.061491008496710554,0.09214770530148256,0.05715858155878419,0.08894143300336549,0.11666039565433715,0.0,0.1609530858783169,0.13045724924066243,0.0,0.13762291724000825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11293987288195882,0.0,0.0,0.053193321860788345,0.0,0.05340051750203283,0.0,0.2339514290496293,0.07179116114560195,0.038334490271482016,0.053000230814251474,0.04771740551568758,0.054651130320536576,0.046526878127855206,0.0,0.0,0.051748532398999014,0.10231751537380977,0.0,0.06088826630977858,0.0,0.0,0.04809571531946418,0.050263068524883464,0.0,0.2243080611842574,0.4742130197713106,0.0,0.22825180906312262,0.0,0.1826733556463081,0.18034831393692477,0.02519795059316513,0.04873263199016529,0.2858012992674313,0.0,0.059385399304751896,0.0983505469776979,0.047523990817315245,0.03479027075999064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918447950856121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909620248306661,0.0,0.03418099417106105,0.0,0.0,

Midway thru the movie I was thinking that if I had rented this thing I would have been stopping it and watching something else. Jon Bon Jovi is in this mess, and that's about the most interesting thing this has going for it. His acting leaves much to be desired however. The acting of the main cast members is pathetic as well. The greatest moment though comes at the end when Gary Cole speaks using a VERY poor English accent, it's quite laughable. Oh, the plot of the movie. These spoiled rich high school kids decide to create a murderer on campus story to scare the other students. Surprise! Killings begin afterwards. The end of the movie wraps up like a Scooby Doo mystery but is far less interesting. Just a huge waste of time.

558931,B00004YA66,A1GBMGSDDG7BFL,128,130,973123200,Frequency: Incredible! This movie has it all.,"I first saw Frequency the day it was released in theatres, after I saw a preview that got me extremely interested in the movie. I didn't know quite what to expect, but what I found was well written movie, with excellent acting performances and a very gripping storyline, a truly enjoyable moviegoing experience. The story focuses on a cop named John Sullivan (played brilliantly by James Caviezel in a breakthrough big screen performance) who lives in Queens, NY in early October 1999, which happens to be the date of an appearance of a phenomenon that allows John to communicate with his father Frank (with a very solid and emotional performance from Dennis Quaid), on the same radio, in the same house. The interesing part is that John talks to Frank thirty years earlier, merely days before Frank, a firefighter, dies herocially trying to rescue a person trapped in a blazing fire. Frank and John end up making catastrophic changes in the timeline, which leads to the brutal murder of John's mother(in an excellent performance from Elizabeth Mitchell) only days later in 1969. The movie is really a combination of several different elements. First of all it focuses on a father-son relationship between Frank and John. The interaction between Caviezel and Quaid is superb, and leads to some of the films most emotionally moving moments. The emotion is skillfully achieved, as Caviezel and Quaid don't act face-to-face, but across a HAM radio. The interplay between the two time periods really adds to the movie without overshadowing the its story. Frequency also combines elements of suspense, action, mystery, and tense drama. Frequency covers all of the bases, and does so very skillfully. This brings us to the DVD disc itself, which comes from New Line Home Video, who completely loaded the disc with a huge amount of special features, including many interesting DVD-ROM features that can be accessed by any PC with a DVD-ROM drive and PC Friendly installed. If you don't have PC Friendly on your computer, the DVD will install it for you if you so choose. The disc also has deleted scenes, as well as several feature legnth commentaries(by the director, producer, and actor Noah Emmerich who plays the adult Gordo, John's best friend). The disc also includes an interesting original documentary, as well as a trailer and animation galleries. If you are are willing to let your mind go a little bit to accept the science of the storyline, it actually becomes a fascinating part of the movie. This movie would definitely be a worthy addition to any DVD collection. Frequency also offers an extremely exciting and rewarding finale that will not disappoint anyone who watches it. The bottom line is this: Frequency is a wonderful movie, with incredibly strong emotional performances from the entire cast, very moving dramatic moments, as well as tense, gripping action sequences, and a rousing finale. Frequency is definitely one to remember.

19191,0767827813,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,2,2,1297468800,The basic truths of a life...,"Some films are so good they have the ability to leave a profound impact upon your spiritual life. The dialog usually contains pearls of wisdom and the better side of the human experience is emphasized. Like great books, you quote lines from the screenplay and ultimately, live a decent life based upon its insightful practicality. The quiet 1985 comedy/drama ""Murphy's Romance"" is one of those films.A down-home, extraordinarily good-natured work about two people carrying the scars of life's misfortune, the film takes place in a small Arizona town that appears to have held back modern time. On a Saturday night, people stroll main street, visit the single-screen movie theater, play bingo and dance to fiddle music while sipping punch in paper cups. Yes, in ""Murphy's Romance"" we've stepped back into a finely waxed version of the 1950s. Then again, this was 1985 and pockets of such rural paradise could have still existed. While atmosphere is key, what brings the film home are the wonderful performances of Sally Field and James Garner. These storied professionals fit their roles like a comfortable jacket on a chilly morning.Field is terrific as Emma, a single mom attempting to rebound from a failed marriage. She and her son (Corey Haim - more on him later) pull up to a dilapidated ranch, roll up their sleeves, and begin to sweep the dust and wash the windows of their new home. She knows horses and is going to make a stand in this small corner of Arizona. Garner comes close to stealing the film as Murphy Jones, an attractive elder statesman who works as the town druggist. Murphy can fill a prescription and make lemon Cokes with equal ease, all the while battling City Hall for a place to park his antique car with liberal bumper stickers.Watching Garner's performance, including an unforgettable scene at a surprise birthday when he gives a tearfully beautiful speech, I am reminded of Atticus Finch, a character forged by Gregory Peck inTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition). These roles are uniquely connected, with an inspirational presence exuding idyllic strength and wisdom. Garner deservedly received an Oscar nomination for this work, the greatest of a long and varied career.The attraction between Emma and Murphy is apparent early on, and if the film takes a roundabout way for them to admit love, there are moments of striking truths en route. Emma's ex-husband Bobby Jack (well played by Brian Kerwin) makes a surprise appearance, and suddenly she's housing her son and ex who appear to have similar levels of maturity. Murphy reluctantly finds himself vying for Emma's attention, all the while providing a sturdy helping hand while Bobby Jack overruns the homestead.I love the film's quiet scenes, when Field discusses her failed marriage, Garner takes a breath of fresh air after viewing a slasher film and the wonderful pep talk he provides Field during her visit to the hospital. This is unforgettable dialog from the brilliant pens of Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch, a storied team who usually worked with director Martin Ritt. Ah, Mr. Ritt, one of the greatest American artists who never made a bad film. Born and bred in New York City, he attended college in the south and was exposed to the Depression-era struggles of the common man. Interestingly, his work was at home in rural settings, and ""Murphy's Romance"" could very well be the best film he ever made, a touching twilight proclamation to a spectacular career includingHud,Norma Rae,The Molly Maguires,Conrack [VHS],SounderandCross Creek. Ritt, unheralded and essentially unknown to today's film buffs, had a knack for detailing the struggles of working class humanity. He understood these characters populating Arizona's dusty back roads and, as in all of his dignified films, they ring with rare crystal truth.I first viewed this film as a young 20-something and uncomfortably realized I was Bobby Jack, a likable man-child without a clue. The beauty of ""Murphy's Romance"" is many of us can relate to Kerwin's immature character. Thank God both Ritt and Garner blessed us with Murphy, a jolting contrast to Bobby Jack who believes in hard work, free speech, tolerance, romance and decency to all. Like Atticus Finch so many years before, it's a wonderfully romantic ideal to aspire to. Having recently watched the film for the first time in many years, I uncomfortably realized Haim played Field's son Jake. Like many child actors before him, he fell into a Hollywood fast lane, got hooked on drugs, and died decades before his time. It breaks your heart. After viewing ""Murphy's Romance"" in 1985, it inspired me to walk better paths. If this were a perfect world, and it's not, perhaps one youthful actor could have done the same.Tragedy in different forms eventually befalls us all. Like Garner's indelible Murphy Jones - even though the first year he spent drunk and the second he didn't talk to a soul - he found a way to appreciate the basic truths of a life blessed with. I'll heed that advice when the next mountain comes around.",1.0,840,0.024849994637280024,0.0625749297710086,0.1054058859079904,0.0,0.09144519064582,0.36493233074735376,0.08126613327274644,0.09567785027847986,0.045333721841995835,0.02151350605268774,0.0,0.0,0.029876310600319905,0.0,0.04738245210842726,0.05035243043977735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02787039606473195,0.25863756717426806,0.08480780514696618,0.10293078417470743,0.06896284725715388,0.0,0.04604682565377882,0.02377423590595495,0.028127164854225162,0.0,0.10076889907411557,0.22560453716580786,0.12107488166505435,0.0649998541302369,0.09740590615541515,0.0,0.0470083375820894,0.184976036798452,0.08861387294317931,0.11342500700148975,0.05516059910663938,0.03177684010356463,0.0,0.11531664098652139,0.0572794627272812,0.12424583726995644,0.02830835339462811,0.024937766402253515,0.0,0.01835549457171489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019878492726494796,0.302257192589924,0.09485970218219153,0.06078294217446306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389929509163496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654407673091775,0.0,0.04539546909332135,0.025420094388448743,0.0,0.0,0.03387252778589557,0.48933784617244097,0.08589900694325539,0.0301595604316266,0.03094395818515277,0.024137149806068996,0.04765987087023211,0.07990744433916383,0.07727017449012999,0.3158421738735752,0.0,0.031387046550726494,0.05198134949698666,0.025117920053120097,0.0735509980998867,0.0,0.061779678503965985,0.030055342416834243,0.05242210900139025,0.02918869142559807,0.024835828918965002,0.07693254894309186,0.0,0.12019070938031069,0.0,0.12646009413595882,0.0,0.019822205916918658,

Prokofiev's classic score is handled in high style here and is a treat for the ear. There are also delightful characters throughout ranging of the balloon-riding bird to the sly cat.  The wolf is especially forbidding and adds a real sense of menace missing in some versions.

510426,B00000K4YV,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,0,0,1192924800,Back when the WWF was good,"Seven long years ago, before we were forced to watch footage with big-ass blurs on the screen, and commentator's voices being strangled out just before they pronounced that letter that comes after E.  You know... when you watch an old Hulk Hogan match or Bret Hart match, the whole ""He's going for the WW(gag) Championship!"", there was the WWF.  And it was good.This event was good, too, and a refreshing departure from my quest of watching exponentially awful WWE events from many years later.WWF Intercontinental and European ChampionshipJeff Jarrett (C) vs D'Lo Brown (C)I don't like either men.  That's simple.  The match wasn't that entertaining, but it was entertaining.  Don't question that logic, because it is flawless.  The surprise finish was really the only highlight of the match.  (5/10)Tag Team TurmoilEdge and Christian w/o Gangrel and Brood vs The Hardy Boys w/ Gangrel and New Brood vs Albert and Droz w/o paralysis vs The Acolytes vs Mideon and Viscera w/o tanktop vs Hardcore Holly and Crash HollyThis one started great, but got progressively weaker as the less exciting tag teams got involved.  It was amazing seeing Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boys going at each other.  (8/10)Lion's Den MatchKen Shamrock vs Steve BlackmanI don't know why this match was ever devised.  Maybe to quell Shamrock's mad desire for a fake MMA match in the WWF?  It was essentially a polygonal cage match sans ropes in a mini-ring off somewhere else in the arena, with such a polyglot of weapons chosen by Steve Blackman as ""Kendo Stick"", ""Singapore Cane"", and ""Shinai"" (note: they're all the exact same weapon), as well as ""the sticks"" as everyone calls them---those two things Blackman wiggles about like a raver.  Blackman also brought in nunchuks, but Shamrock threw them out of the cage after a while.  There was some good wrestling, but it was mostly about the weapons.  I don't think anyone but Shamrock understood the rules of the match, as Blackman was laying on the ground, Shamrock climbed on the cage and started posing, and the referees sort of... declared Shamrock the winner.  (6/10)Women's ChampionshipIvory (C) vs ToriTwo women without last names go at it, in a Diva's match that actually was far better than Diva matches in the WWE today.  Luckily it was only a few minutes long.  (4/10)Hardcore ChampionshipAl Snow vs The Big Boss Man (C)The Hardcore stories (as I call them) of late 1999 to early 2001 were some of the highlights of my WWF watching days during that time.  This was all the Hardcore division was about, sans harder hits with harder weapons.  Snow and the Boss Man ended up outside of the arena, running across the street, and brawling on the sidewalk while security held the crowd off.  They then ended up in a restaurant, and it was just a fun entertaining experience.  Highlight of my DVD watching.  (10/10)Tag Team ChampionshipThe Undertaker and The Big Show vs Kane and X-Pac (C)Kane and X-Pac is an awkward pairing for me, but everyone was certainly at their best in this match.  Despite X-Pac's small size to these giants, he actually has the best strategy against them than anyone else his size/weight would.  He relies almost entirely on his legs, kicking and such, while Kane holds up most of the match in an excellent display of power wrestling by the Undertaker and Kane.  (9/10)Test vs Shane McMahonThe Mean Street Posse came out, and the crowd died.  No, not really, but they did come out and they were pretty dumb.  Then the match started, and despite Test's severe lack of charisma, it came out fairly decently.  (6/10)The Rock vs Billy GunnThe buildup to this match was among the absolute best in The Rock's promos and insults.  Who can forget that promo in which God spoke to Billy?  The match had little technical wrestling, but was a great display of athleticism and high-impact entertainment.  (8/10)WWF ChampionshipMankind vs Triple H vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (C)Jesse Ventura as the guest referee was pretty useless here.  He was completely biased against Triple H, so much so that just because Triple H used a steel chair, he REFUSED to count his pinfalls for the rest of the match.  The match itself was fairly plain and Mankind didn't get to do much, while there was an awkward sort of attempt at kinship between Ventura and Austin.  Jesse didn't even bother to get out of the ring and follow the wrestlers when they started brawling around the arena.  (6/10)It wasn't the greatest Summerslam ever, although it was the only Summerslam I've seen thus far.  It was simply good, and far greater than many WWE events I've seen thus far.",0.0,780,0.0669380492686771,0.05618570940201826,0.03785736234342517,0.025972721860684254,0.08210816898461197,0.3615678602287149,0.0,0.13745384387335496,0.0814098339653718,0.0,0.05488416247443043,0.0,0.08047735945706463,0.12696557187540353,0.04254446141068726,0.022605594882228727,0.026485899222554912,0.10930819850415216,0.026230668745417764,0.025024686083430222,0.0,0.0,0.061614016447434465,0.041280925227890085,0.05047593744679782,0.08269041849623525,0.04269352965333684,0.025255237466272645,0.02187519560762045,0.0,0.11253842225953484,0.0,0.0,0.06559519871595619,0.0,0.0,0.15224828426656653,0.0,0.025460933418658748,0.1609673644119532,0.0,0.06531110441793926,0.04141688886201446,0.0,0.055779850914786745,0.025417925730011975,0.0,0.026798690140678337,0.0,0.0,0.05048744305177454,0.06591281069322308,0.02534204945288987,0.017848796950602916,0.222050607817584,0.0851740414296066,0.01819223096806583,0.07545626146365765,0.022645039915504962,0.02593554729477377,0.1324803393180377,0.0,0.0,0.04911614825155896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029471862122266587,0.04076035952384487,0.04564914548071845,0.0,0.07583493241335594,0.13686286256086816,0.5679712028320786,0.025709426334675392,0.10832046024215089,0.05556884358325582,0.06501787008437492,0.12838066289416217,0.05979040465470749,0.023126831492171193,0.11097120230093338,0.027492843544777094,0.028182268568901877,0.07001068178223298,0.0,0.412756656358971,0.05241039277721683,0.0,0.02698653823807852,0.02353477177978112,0.07862513023659767,0.0,0.04605156148307555,0.025426719337458374,0.021583724647481036,0.0,0.04866337360489033,0.024249603627692448,0.03559651462432659,
975628,B000EOTTV8,A3M2WW0PO34B94,2,3,1139184000,A Great Performance by Huffman,"From the moment we first see Bree Osborne (Felicity Huffman, TV's ""Desperate Housewives""), a pre-op Transgender patient, it is difficult to recognize the well-known actress. Occasionally, an actor will so completely take on the role they are playing it becomes difficult to spot them, to remember we are not watching an actor play a role. Often when this happens, the actor has gone on to win an Academy Award. Huffman does this with Bree Osborne in ""Transamerica"". If she doesn't win the Oscar, she will be robbed.Bree has slowly and deliberately completed all of the necessary requirements to receive the surgery she so desperately wants. The surgery which will finally remove all traces of her former self, of Stanley, and help her finally live the life she has always dreamed of. Her psychiatrist (Elizabeth Pena) has guided her through the process, helping her, preparing her, making sure she is ready for the final step. And both are very happy when Bree has reached the final step. But then she receives a call from New York informing her that Stanley's son is in jail. She talks to her psychiatrist about this and learns she must travel to New York and help the son she never knew she had, her former self had, before she can have the surgery. Heartbroken, she realizes this is just the latest hurdle on the long journey. Upon her arrival in New York, she bails Toby (Kevin Zegers) out and realizes he is living in squalor, as a prostitute. She poses as a missionary from a church and agrees to give him a ride to Los Angeles. Along the way, they learn a lot about each other, making them stronger, better people.""Transamerica"" is a good film featuring a great performance by Huffman. The film's roots and production values are very evident, giving the finished product a grainy, low-budget look, ultimately detracting from the film. But only slightly.Felicity Huffman's transformation is amazing. Much like Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie"", the two actors successfully become their characters in both appearance and manner. Huffman does a better job, simply because she is more successful in satisfying both the appearance and mannerisms of her character. In ""Tootsie"", we bought into Hoffman's portrayal of Dorothy Michaels, because it was funny and it fit. No one in their right mind would ever believe she is a real woman. But because the acting was so good, and the film was so funny, we went along for the ride. In ""Transamerica"", Huffman looks remarkably similar to Hoffman in the comedy, but the key difference is that Bree is a pre-op transsexual and the film is more dramatic. She isn't a woman. Yet. We can believe her very mannish appearance because of the stage of her transformation.Huffman does a remarkable job of becoming a very masculine looking woman, a masculine looking woman who wants to appear feminine. Huffman is a great actress and very good looking, but she isn't a beauty, in the traditional Hollywood sense. If she were, the role would have been difficult to pull off. The role embraces Huffman's unique looks, allowing her to become all the more convincing as she plays the role.Huffman also captures the right amount of exaggerated femininity for the role. As Bree is trying to become a woman, many aspects of her character are learned through observation and practice. Every piece of clothing Bree wears is very feminine, too feminine, and tightly coordinated with every other piece. The result? She looks like a Mary Kay Salesman, wearing pink skirts and matching coats with bright scarves around her neck. As Bree is, essentially, playing a part, she occasionally slips and ""let's down her guard"". The few times this happens, we see further skill of Huffman's ability and realize Bree has been working on the process for a long time. Her mannerisms are just right, making her appear like a man trying to be a woman, always moving her hands, trying to be delicate, demure and very feminine. Because Bree tries so hard, she gives herself away but we get a sense that her surgery will make everything right again, when she can acclimate, everything will fall into place.If the performance were simply about becoming the character, it would be good, but because Bree lives a believable life, the performance becomes great. During the first act, we witness Bree's life and learn of how she has adapted her life. Living in a small cottage in a largely Latino neighborhood, she waits for the bus with other workers. Standing next to a man, Bree realizes she is too tall and bends her knees a little, until she is lower than him. We watch Bree at her job as a bus boy, with her psychiatrist, in her neighborhood. But something we don't really realize, until later in the film, is how isolated her life is. No significant other, no friends, no family. This is part of the reason her psychiatrist postpones her surgery until she deals with the discovery of her son. The psychiatrist won't let her blow off his problems, or postpone meeting him until after the surgery. It is painful for Bree, but she does it, always hoping to successfully navigate the new hurdle in time for her to keep her scheduled surgery.Upon her arrival in New York, she meets Toby (Zegers), and bails him out. When she sees his living conditions, that he is living in squalor, and working as a prostitute, she can't simply leave him there. She has to help. Initially, she decides to reunite him with his step-dad, something he doesn't seem very eager for.Kevin Zegers is very good. Toby is a fairly typical character; into drugs, aimless, trying to survive, he sells his body for money. At first, the character doesn't seem like it will offer anything new, and for a long time, this appears to be the case. But then we realize he is just as isolated as Bree. Throughout the film, we watch him form a friendship, a bond, with his new found friend.""Transamerica"" ultimately becomes a road picture and this is not my favorite type of film. Road pictures just seem like easy, manipulative ways to get two or three characters to learn about each other, for the benefit of the audience. But in the case of ""Transamerica"", the two characters are so believable, and so interesting, that I was willing to overlook the inevitable scene in which they have to campout, or visit a back roads diner, or a small gas station. The road trip aspect of the film is very predictable and also very low-budget. The filmmakers obviously don't have to pay a lot to film in the wilderness, at a low-budget motel, or on the back roads of Kentucky.From the road picture scenario to the grainy look of the film, ""Transamerica"" is a low-budget film. And it works. But why can't a major studio spend some money on a project like this? Perhaps with the success of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and the positive reviews for Huffman in this film, studios will be more willing to make films exploring challenging themes like these. Not every film about gay people or people with challenging needs has to look like it was made with a couple of hand held cameras and a bootleg copy of AVID on someone's home computer.I was also impressed with the resolution of ""Transamerica"". The film ends on a realistic note, the characters are happy with some of their accomplishments and unhappy with other aspects of their lives. They don't ride off into the sunset, happy as clams. Given the backgrounds of the characters, their problems, their secrets, their previous lives, this seems entirely realistic. If the characters resolved everything well and lived happily ever after, the film would end on a false note, changing our view of the project. We get the sense that Bree and her son will have to get to know each other some more, after we have gone home, in private.",0.6666666666666666,1336,0.052823770799041894,0.03990476210845213,0.026887424835354827,0.03689319929178893,0.029157831994676496,0.18189734337760058,0.06909914726957575,0.0813531738324538,0.02890984284306334,0.05487765431254191,0.07796072952974442,0.02484879704042681,0.0,0.09017472584353561,0.01007211400487489,0.05351721969257998,0.0,0.03881696702093228,0.0,0.0,0.159938124945053,0.036055283926157776,0.08752021448332234,0.04886490172109436,0.04779934963185316,0.048940995760007364,0.030322214714714545,0.023916027849076173,0.09321848769964212,0.051409201227373774,0.053285423359104855,0.45039670273216537,0.09671938415540147,0.05176406812486361,0.025687113531903647,0.03997035309383992,0.15728183307529398,0.05023119972233821,0.1748034186176433,0.058627595033273715,0.0,0.04123190141449067,0.07844135053323813,0.0,0.013205503112739523,0.0,0.05301034772444016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011952561282262743,0.010402941952503852,0.04799647291199513,0.0253534930435635,0.1752299408377398,0.07259176535608836,0.008613775717811564,0.011909173644753879,0.06433272377492974,0.08596092009584864,0.020909217271708008,0.040749325310643104,0.0,0.011627916496452999,0.022990787752547346,0.0,0.47885664617835133,0.0,0.0675481794982853,0.032421380992597344,0.0,0.011968938838611949,0.043201811596258084,0.3957789101446373,0.08521146354642276,0.025644137649028887,0.02631109710318328,0.010261694521133988,0.04052434025694642,0.06228188838901527,0.03285072730555218,0.19849715995530767,0.026034980377645393,0.04003177088578825,0.0,0.11746526293640222,0.04690432882235555,0.024815613294368512,0.01313254036858495,0.17888866047677265,0.022286793306084407,0.024818625006488404,0.0,0.04360958507689799,0.024078416550127452,0.010219602180444919,0.09024005720116542,0.1075267681199681,0.04592743952326378,0.0,

971684,B000ECXWW2,A33872WCAUCJ60,1,1,1199232000,"Yes, it IS dark...maybe a little too dark","Poor Sean Bean: a great actor, he has been cast as a worried father in two recent films -- 'The Dark' and 'Silent Hill' -- that don't give him much to do except try to deal with an obsessive mother and a tragic child. At least 'The Dark' has great scenery!  The plot is pretty standard (and very much like the aforementioned 'Silent Hill'): an American mother brings her daughter to Wales to visit her father, an artist, who lives in suitably remote and rather creepy cottage.  Maria Bello's Adele is not the most sympathetic mother; in flashbacks, she's not the best caretaker for her child, and we see that the Welsh trip is an attempt for a ""second chance"" with her daughter.  Of course, in the dark upper story of the cottage, there's a secret, and, like many films of this kind ('The Ring' is another good example), the mother's devotion to saving her child takes her into what appears to be madness.  At times, the film is literally so 'dark', it's hard to tell what's happening; I like creepy, but when you have to rewind a scene to try to see it clearly, that destroys the suspense. There is, of course, the requisite twist at the end (who's really alive, good, come back from the dead, etc), and at least Sean Bean has a little more to do here than in 'Silent Hill'!  I also liked the killer sheep, which is something you just don't see in most horror films...",1.0,252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06286560009572846,0.1987384819991725,0.19144035087767686,0.0,0.04158747024528919,0.19704819900581205,0.04675545542849835,0.0,0.0635131094994681,0.06493039791934396,0.03841418176278458,0.0,0.0,0.1282154375372837,0.1322873576979332,0.0,0.0,0.05109989643687939,0.0,0.07456673465054398,0.049959148503541495,0.0,0.10007389307937173,0.10333743133501101,0.0,0.15884326330458845,0.04380035274306243,0.05447866024301049,0.39469934974828935,0.07063232220732106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20100486695867487,0.0641950530455079,0.21569395130454008,0.05994046081153597,0.0,0.05269402509001375,0.1503710846927021,0.0,0.06750609003972821,0.0,0.05419742475500403,0.1297296252976423,0.0,0.0,0.12220218665465299,0.0,0.0,0.0864041387194757,0.11943594588670167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05944152004528632,0.17629220653590502,0.0,0.06993997577495444,0.0,0.049329147621277485,0.0,0.05773522565283905,0.061184814847370185,0.11042310764679983,0.44095570861362077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10491487804589195,0.0,0.028943902674092685,0.0,0.32828880108883063,0.0,0.06821369108506395,0.0,0.054588953963341576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531948903711988,0.0,0.0,0.10795176659783962,0.055732684920505454,0.06154402985520872,0.10448452877161128,0.0,0.07852474866422458,0.0,0.08615948167381293,

515571,B000031EG8,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,12,12,1046217600,I actually liked this title....,"This is a pretty cute show. It has excellent animation, a good story, and good music. My beef with it is that the show ends after a couple of episodes--it just stops.This is an OVA, and the Sakura Wars TV series comes after it. And both come after the game.I think I should have had a little knowledge of the games before I watched this, since it just picked up with the Demons. It didn't give ANY background on the Demons at all, which had me lost for the first episode or two. But as it went along I stopped worrying about how and why the Demons existed/were there and focused on the show itself.The dubbing in both versions is top notch. I personally prefer the English version. Since the girls are from various countries, not just Japan, they cannot be expected to speak Japanese all that well, and without an accent.But in the English, we get to hear the girls in their &quot;native&quot; tongues and with &quot;native&quot; accents. What I mean is this: The French girl *sounds* French (and she even speaks in French when we first meet her). The Russian Maria has a definitive Russian accent, which comes across very well even though we never get to hear her speak in Russian. And the Chinese teenager talks with a Chinese accent, and also speaks in Chinese.So, watch this. You won't regret doing so, but you might want to watch the TV series just to get a little better idea of what is going on. Or get (or at least see) the games.",1.0,264,0.04840583836757968,0.1828365748506435,0.08212895577207575,0.05634604190397401,0.08906402561659821,0.2451239745979479,0.039575011678848845,0.037274587971054096,0.0883065306095639,0.04190662058107933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329116839814297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10857868638135926,0.0,0.11013263029292882,0.033416847599197136,0.04477807053111517,0.21900818110441292,0.08969560084303137,0.0,0.10957901726299263,0.0949134784545171,0.03925798063346779,0.0,0.11792218142896847,0.0,0.0,0.058846909589496274,0.0,0.1801593978154958,0.0,0.16570725575285272,0.188034902875433,0.0,0.18891729284631228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055142449681537635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04766444340143063,0.0,0.0387217430005505,0.08028726523160318,0.11086755096210768,0.0,0.0,0.1473805912418828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.364904930900601,0.0,0.05266986524527526,0.13097075547427797,0.06268676032325472,0.19181156141857228,0.08842680940684063,0.0,0.05174771956390354,0.0,0.06598102450475536,0.44172298396485804,0.055774840286322944,0.0,0.0,0.047017272607931586,0.046418843135345854,0.12971118946256469,0.0,0.1337469033114019,0.0,0.06113950221505817,0.050627793659661295,0.0489277360405178,0.0,0.11370075895276215,0.0,0.1756363413771886,0.10211415222609835,0.05685727904299095,0.09675648932114769,0.04995285490267922,0.11032305362171013,0.0,0.0,0.14076247652121152,0.0,0.07722420143011106,

I'm not a huge fan of either westerns or Sci-Fi, but a Western Sci-Fi? Hmm... maybe. When you add the star power of Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford it becomes something you want to see.The movie starts out well. The sets look authentic. The clothes are plain, but nice. Daniel Craig plays the steely man's man to perfection. Harrison Ford growls as a semi-evil cattle baron. There's some cool fight sequences. You're really interested... then the aliens show up and ruin everything that was interesting. Character development gets thrown to the wind in favor of cheesy action sequences.Mind you, it will keep you entertained up until it's illogical final battle sequence.

105728,0790736594,A27M15DFUPV1CK,3,3,1085443200,The Fab Three.,"While &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; is not the Marx Bros. at their best, it still has enough chuckles and gags to amuse Groucho, Chico and Harpo's legion of fans. Sure--it doesn't compare to &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; or &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;--but--to be fair--how many comedies do ?All three of &quot;Minnie's boys&quot; have a chance to shine in this wacky hotel farce set in &quot;exotic&quot; Casablanca. What fans will appreciate most is that the Marxes are on screen for most of the film. For this viewer at least, some of their MGM films were spoiled by saccharine romantic sub-plots, with some boring young tenor of the day crooning to a starlet. While there is some music in this film--including expected turns on piano by Chico and on harp by ( duh ) Harpo--it doesn't detract from the fun.Groucho shines as the new hotel manager--Harpo is valet to a very suspicious-looking German ( Sig Ruman, hamming it up wonderfully )--Chico seems to be a con-man, intent on ensuring that Groucho does not meet the same nasty fate of previous hotel managers. Of course, we have the usual number of pompous, arrogant people who run head-long into Groucho's rapier wit. I did miss Margaret Dumont though.The quality of the DVD is excellent--crisp B &amp; W picture--clear mono sound.Groucho, Chico and Harpo were quite simply three of the funniest human beings of the 20th century. While &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; is not a top-tier Marx movie, it will still provide you with a lot of amusement, and deserves a spot in your classic comedy DVD collection.",1.0,271,0.0,0.0,0.022616836457718392,0.0,0.0,0.06750273144508515,0.021796492078550087,0.020529501495422715,0.09727211759456326,0.04616131668875702,0.0,0.0,0.03205265175595906,0.018963019325126108,0.07625104336470004,0.0,0.03164653922362716,0.0,0.06268315682534409,0.0,0.05045055129005799,0.0,0.03680959388700818,0.02466214962978373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026137463938983387,0.04324376557819596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03241075982802889,0.0,0.0992253121547539,0.03168965146769847,0.09126559245731569,0.07397346920892263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03332413268339457,0.0,0.0,0.06404055165750935,0.019692601378607788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06397962720225037,0.17687734420196047,0.08141580907750286,0.0,0.0,0.027057308414749053,0.0,0.0,0.034277021022159085,0.9043942614986934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818154668362397,0.0,0.0,0.036339973557636414,0.17926272103545868,0.06143754924691389,0.0,0.0,0.02589542154201129,0.0,0.042864152812838875,0.0,0.10312817287586264,0.0,0.0,0.02788396659013631,0.02694763604071175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03224472515299723,0.0,0.06262988586461044,0.02664499596552054,0.0,0.0,0.025789201375001975,0.05693027395199533,0.038763452925163165,0.0,0.021266155376062457,

554967,B00004WG9R,A2P49WD75WHAG5,1,1,1059436800,Oh Smeg!  It's Red Dwarf!,"By the late 1980's, Doctor Who was in its dying days, with plummeting ratings.  Meanwhile, based in Manchester, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor came up with ideas for a sci-fi sitcom called Red Dwarf.  It was the name of the title ship, the size of a city, with a crew of 169.  The weekly show debuted on 15 February 1988, and this video comprises the first three episodes of Red Dwarf's first season, which are its freshest and funniest stories in the canon.For the majority of the first two seasons, the beginning of each episode, starting with &quot;Future Echoes&quot; began with this intro from Holly, the ship's computer.  &quot;This is an SOS distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf.  The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak.  The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was in the hold.  Revived three millions years later, Lister's only companion is a lifeform evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew.&quot;  Holly would then make a smart-aleck remark, like &quot;I've got the IQ of 6000, the same IQ as 6000 PE teachers.&quot;  Ouch!  And love that rock-guitar title theme, which has a girl singing lyrics during the end credits.The debut episode &quot;The End&quot;, introduces us to the situation that befell Lister and to the cast who will star for the first two seasons.  There's Lister (Craig Charles), the lowest ranking member of the crew, third class maintenance technician.  He's an Afro-British, with a bunch of rasta pigtails hanging down his back, cheery, laid back, fun-loving, lazy, wanting fun and excitement.  In contrast, his immediate superior Rimmer (Christopher Barrie) is uptight, sensible to a fault, irritable, and wanting to become an officer to the point of writing exam answers on his bare legs and arms.  Then there's the Cat (Danny John-Jules), who's got a lively personality, call him a jive-talking Morris Day, Little Richard, and James Brown rolled up in one.  He is funny, obsessed with how he looks, and with even fangs of a cat, and a fancy dresser at that.  And Holly (Norman Lovett), the ship's computer, who appears as a disembodied head on a screen and speaks in a deadpan manner with some personality--it's his lines that are funny.  Oh, this introduces us to the classic Red Dwarf insult--smeghead.When one goes into faster than lightspeed, one sees &quot;Future Echoes&quot; which involves catching up with things you're about to do before you've actually done them.  The scene in the drive room between Rimmer and Lister is a hilarious example of that.  Another highlight, is Rimmer, who wanting a crewcut, gets rude and calls Holly a &quot;stupid, jumped-up filo-fax.&quot;  In retaliation, Holly gives Rimmer a Helen Shapiro hairdo, which is sidesplitting.In &quot;Balance Of Power&quot; Lister is missing Christine Kochansky, Red Dwarf's navigation officer he saw as his ideal woman.  He wants to bring her back but Holly can only sustain one hologram at a time, and we know what that means for the &quot;obnoxious, ruthless, insensitive, single-minded&quot; Rimmer.  Lister decides that outranking Rimmer is the only way to get Kochansky's hologram disk.  The lively party scene Lister reminisces over is a highlight, as is the Cat getting fish from the food dispenser.This is a blend of creative story ideas and side-splitting dialogue, with an assorted bunch of gags in each story.  In one, Lister is happily spraying his underarms.  He then sprays another bottle on his chin, stares aghast, only to realize he had accidentally sprayed shaving cream on his underarms.  Rimmer also advises Lister to listen to more classical music, &quot;Mozart, Mendelssohn, Motorhead.&quot;  American audiences who haven't seen Red Dwarf may remember Christopher Barrie (Rimmer) playing Lara Croft's butler in the first Tomb Raider movie.  And Claire Grogan (Kochansky) was the lead singer of the Scottish 80's group Altered Images, who later fronted Universal Love School.",1.0,655,0.01991920062641923,0.0,0.0,0.02318662688304147,0.07330042220864717,0.20173903781127514,0.048855837891148786,0.06135458210014792,0.03633849880829746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014168246198154759,0.03798071522734019,0.02018069175864268,0.02364475568749805,0.0,0.0,0.022340286943897936,0.0,0.1133000704202964,0.05500467828498149,0.07370543724912507,0.02253069074601426,0.0,0.0,0.02254610707010614,0.019528642445258163,0.0,0.140652989290394,0.024262730172666957,0.026051215583881723,0.19519599654129438,0.024215744172360252,0.0,0.1729847691649307,0.02367696706047007,0.14774329705810504,0.022107752060241414,0.05094321045421605,0.0,0.018487048716938473,0.045913937869690474,0.0,0.0,0.01998955651266232,0.0,0.014713354441639346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1982312296814952,0.07603741838619049,0.09744449747452273,0.11227010848353687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6757194272398196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026310414220076475,0.0,0.020376179852626596,0.04258879683585628,0.02256670533031853,0.09503011581646474,0.3922422871426266,0.0,0.0241752299672907,0.07441195705622716,0.03869560026509928,0.0,0.05337668540675025,0.020646015295287944,0.13208975561955053,0.0,0.05031831084395863,0.08333417729669394,0.0,0.07369604645845226,0.0,0.024760605157435847,0.024091691134553013,0.0,0.023397003058378524,0.01990784570303784,0.020555804262968876,0.09079677629473229,0.1734159382865842,0.021267766584288462,0.15929192198503064,0.021648347616122384,0.0317780749879884,

I would have much preferred seeing more of them and less of Eddie Cibrian's dimples.  That said, as formula flicks go, this one is neither better nor worse than most.  It is what it is, a group of people in a cave trying to keep from ending up on something's dinner menu.  As it so happens, I love this formula; it's tried and true.  I know what to expect and I count on that.  There are absolutely no surprises in this movie (although they do try to offer one concerning the origins of the monsters).  I love the opening ""history"" sequence; it has fabulous camerawork, each image nicely composed.  It's rather abruptly dismissed though, in favor of ""the present.""  The story fairly zips along.  There isn't much for the actors to do, but some do better with nothing than others.  There are few challenges; this won't strain your brain.  I thought it was fun; it certainly fit my criteria just by being a monster movie.  I liked it.

1200807,B001HN6940,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,13,19,1268265600,not so wonderful,"Wonderland weirdness is utterly normal for Tim Burton and collaborator Johnny Depp who of course about everybody felt were perfect to do a new film version.My immediate reaction after just seeing this is been-there-done-that, but I vaguely recall it being a way cooler trip. Why is that?The highlight for me was Johnny Depp yet again perfectly transformed and fully immersed in another character, except for the ultra-goofy ""dance"" which was maybe the worst, most cringe inducing thing in the whole movie. But what an actor! He even came up with the look of his Mad Hatter. Perfect.The biggest failure of this film -I'd agree with Roger Ebert- is the big, dumb, loud and boring unnecessary third act battle.But I found this movie in general just really *odd*. It's a story about an upper class English girl from stuffy aristocratic society, this time in her late teens, hanging out with a bunch of weirdos, as director Tim Burton put it. Well Burton said ""brat"" hanging with a bunch of weirdos is basically the depth to which the story has been brought to the screen before, but here Alice seems like a pretty cool, independently minded chick ahead of her time. In fact the Burton version is basically a ""you-go-girl"" fable about following your bliss (literally following your dreams in this case) and having the courage to be yourself...It felt familiar but wasn't what I expected at the same time and the story didn't truly hold my interest and exactly why I can't put my finger on. Combination of things. Burton's attempt to add a tad more depth to these dream creatures and this being Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole? The pacing of events and subplots? I don't recall the Disney cartoon so much or the original Lewis Carrol story at all but there were details in this version that were weird. Members of The Red Queen's court and the intrigues, the Knave of Hearts, just the look of some of these characters and the castle were creepy, but not in a good way to me. This movie will give many kids some weird dreams by the way.The special effects were OK but for a person not too big on cgi I was again underwhelmed. Props on The Cheshire Cat tho... I dug that. To be sure there were some moments. I went in with an open mind towards the cgi and the 3-D and I gotta say I think 3-D is overall just lame. It strikes me as mostly a gimmick and the visuals will look more vibrant and colorful in good ole 2-dimension in your home on Blue Ray. (Although I want to add as a side note the preview for a 3-D documentary of the mission to repair to Hubble Telescope was incredible!!)Sorry don't want to harsh anybody's high.2.8 stars",0.6842105263157895,473,0.10690649123141693,0.04486698607998227,0.030230921125048358,0.0,0.09835097164635298,0.2526381313672529,0.0,0.08232261947044592,0.06500966039536733,0.061701782495312385,0.0,0.08381635965304943,0.0,0.2027762079218703,0.03397379472839904,0.036103305331737674,0.04230052390124304,0.08728784370456956,0.0,0.03996682623075889,0.06743501194856365,0.0,0.12300437458655362,0.032964800432011665,0.0,0.06603226861606958,0.0,0.0,0.0349367875664391,0.0,0.03594693297438612,0.08681216343639109,0.0,0.03492060999170202,0.0,0.0,0.24315512693851826,0.0,0.14232244287834833,0.09887705193349274,0.0,0.1390774721413503,0.03307337392061877,0.0,0.044542888595215,0.12178460310082033,0.07152272784837507,0.04280008102773486,0.07896667778493115,0.0,0.04031664686139028,0.10526908679590744,0.0,0.05701248469407878,0.25612610052640994,0.10882489720236853,0.0,0.0,0.036166302836895654,0.0,0.03526397016439089,0.0,0.0,0.03922160213618095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032549103728246744,0.10935910198401315,0.15238291672710022,0.0,0.0971480583821736,0.5305705802176139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383978072263896,0.0,0.15278562648959446,0.11080731072119213,0.2363088855110679,0.04390871065795726,0.0,0.03727126011702756,0.0,0.10547392126504108,0.0,0.13289034373383093,0.0,0.03758729004500453,0.2511437631673297,0.07123036618465632,0.0,0.0812178238712338,0.03447128045972187,0.07609616953669159,0.12953346615317818,0.0,0.028425525692271074,

763016,B0000AGWMF,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0,0,1282694400,Abominable: Likely the Single Worst Film Ever Made,"The story behind the 1966 MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE is more entertaining than the film itself.  Hal Warren was a Texas fertilizer salesman who dabbled in El Paso community theatre and who undertook the film as a bet.  Warren he raised the money, coaxed the cast and crew into working for percentage of profits, and pieced the movie together over three months of shooting.  The film was highly anticipated in El Paso, but it was on the screen for only a few minutes when the audience of local dignitaries began to snicker.  Most of the cast and crew quickly fled the scene; by mid-point most of the audience was gone as well.  Those who remained ended the showing by throwing their shoes at the screen, and an elderly lady attacked Warren with her purse.  The film had a brief run in El Paso and played several drive-ins in the area before it mercifully vanished--only to be rediscovered in 1993 by television's Mystery Science Theater 3000, a televison series that ridiculed bad movies.  The episode was so successful that it brought the original and unfiltered  MANOS to DVD, and it is has easily usurped PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE's position as the worst film ever made.Michael (Hal Warren), wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), and daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) are on a vacation, where they get lost somewhere in Texass and seek shelter in an unimpressive house guarded by an unprepossessing servant named Torgo (John Reynolds, who committed suicide not long after the film wrapped.)  The family subsequently discover that Torgo's master (Tom Neyman) is a devil-worshipper with a host of wives--and he plans to add Margaret to the harem.  The plot, either deliberately or by accident, seems to owe a great deal to the celebrated 1930s Boris Karloff-Bela Lugosi THE BLACK CAT, but to say it does not live up to that famous film's fundamental plot would be the cinematic understatement of all time.The movie was filmed with cameras that could not sustain more than about thirty seconds per shot.  The result is one cut after another after another.  The shots do not seem to have been edited so much as merely strung together.  There is typically a pause at the beginning and end of each shot; consequently the actors (all of them uniformly bad) have lots of stand-around time.  The actors are also badly placed for the camera, and the result is numerous close-ups of the back a head or empty space or something equally irrelevant.  The film was shot without sound and the entire script was dubbed afterward, and badly so, with lines out of synch and inappropriate voices and similar issues.  It hardly matters: the script is ridiculous and the whole thing is an insult to both art and intelligence.  If you have ever desired a catalogue of what NOT to do in making a film, MANOS provides it and then some.Some bad films are actually so inept that they are amusing, and I did indeed laugh at the film for about fifteen minutes.  But MANOS is so relentlessly bad that it soon becomes very, very difficult to be amused by it, and I soon understood why the audience threw their shoes at the screen during the movie's debut.  Its sixty-something minutes felt longer than DANCES WITH WOLVES, OUT OF AFRICA, and THE ENGLISH PATIENT combined, and I felt tremendously sorry for all those involved.  My recommendation: the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode featuring MANOS is available on DVD and is extremely funny.  But MANOS on its own is not and should be avoided at all costs.  If you have to see it for yourself, remember that the film is in public domain and is all over the internet.  Don't purchase it or rent it, for it isn't worth seeing at any price.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",0.0,637,0.05017063582714388,0.09475124821779453,0.10640405346393458,0.029200163079487394,0.09231115388557178,0.34298207000779474,0.08203570336772861,0.07726711660282307,0.1372890627798196,0.0868689344435684,0.0,0.029500921843515857,0.0,0.07137132996935133,0.14349345647922374,0.0,0.05955421851848197,0.030722783304796598,0.05898032629453746,0.0,0.2610868006879169,0.0,0.12122309865408291,0.02320530276326532,0.028374107514461146,0.0,0.023999372014287673,0.02839352211839814,0.024593467044557775,0.08137852441328394,0.050609101353539195,0.03055535767963077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04745349486177179,0.14004578543813456,0.029817674769202468,0.2003734488738153,0.18096960790310018,0.06415551777148486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050347841710713145,0.06025753685900694,0.055587949637003774,0.030425604182104816,0.02838057517586858,0.0247011054083749,0.0,0.1204004226878973,0.20803601803692295,0.07660639999840219,0.020452847179307072,0.056555108135521795,0.10183589721879474,0.0,0.049647569138916735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02729506106494043,0.0339364335920005,0.0,0.0,0.11456338227265904,0.05132163273553443,0.026817178264849723,0.08525838783742935,0.13677316883936266,0.5903564865123535,0.057808299467371385,0.030445163977055423,0.03123698978245726,0.02436572261888529,0.04811119800830751,0.0,0.05200126923204441,0.19407233440159327,0.0,0.0,0.02623679998208503,0.05071156103309071,0.14849501556255748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02645926667579621,0.0,0.025071018049423344,0.025887027023655574,0.0,0.09706310843350228,0.0,0.09118402843842875,0.02726292547772634,0.040019834565937586,

244565,6301066162,A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0,6,9,971395200,Great mainstream comedy,"Broadcast news is a fantastic example of great mid-80's mainstream comedy. It'd make a fantastic double-feature with Tootsie, with which it shares a bunch of traits, like:- an incredible cast of supporting actors.- a bunch of seemingly throwaway lines and situations that make you belly laugh at the time and then creep up on you later.- some moderately serious (simple) questions, asked in an effortlessly funny way.- a particular sort of mid 80's look and feel. (I was surprised to feel a little nostalgic while watching this again.)Holly Hunter is amazing in this movie, just amazing and charismatic and lovable and genuine, and Albert Brooks brings a real(ly funnily neurotic) pathos to his corner of the love triangle. Bill Hurt never really comes clear for me in anything, but like Brooks, he's perfectly cast here. (It's creepy that Hurt gets top billing on Amazon and the DVD box. Among the three main characters, his easily pulls the least weight. Holly Hunter's the emotional center of everything in this movie, she's making the choices and carrying every scene, and her name should go first.)After you watch this one, tell me if you think Cher, in Moonstruck, deserved the Best Actress Oscar over Holly Hunter in Broadcast News (and Meryl Streep in Out of Africa).

The dialogue that sounded like classic Elmore Leonard was taut and witty, but seemed out of context.  Ms. Foster has a hot figure, but her character is more valley girl than sultry temptress.  And while I love Owen Wilson's perennially sunny personality and the fact that he makes such an unlikely con artist, he doesn't bring any cynicism or complexity to this role.  Even his most cold and calculating lines are delivered in a characteristically laid-back and friendly tone of voice.  This flic is billed as a film noir, but it seems like all the noir got laundered out in the gorgeous turquoise surf.",1.0,122,0.0,0.0,0.11220299038281766,0.0,0.12167754862788537,0.4018603578607236,0.10813323055329879,0.10184764182918499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28222879167172726,0.12609478048685427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833810060408506,0.12514355692027854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966895792254626,0.0,0.2668362871335026,0.16110300276451472,0.0,0.12960891435804042,0.0,0.0,0.1640868557699703,0.0,0.22638604678232252,0.07339704179891939,0.0,0.0,0.2455056821188133,0.1524328302484979,0.0,0.0,0.13272939834894423,0.1588538126269571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14624921119813264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342323415355007,0.0,0.2617666123270526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13529655301636326,0.0,0.14984150445327538,0.1802839982161972,0.2540940608173102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21265070094209684,0.0,0.07308897265236268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978674229308696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09615348600804395,0.0,0.0,

904618,B0009ETD1Y,A220FJEQNGMSRN,1,2,1182211200,Conventional and padded out giallo,"The most memorable thing about giallo The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is the trailer, which shamelessly compares itself to other `masterpieces on violence' such as The Golem, Battleship Potemkin and M. The film itself is fairly conventional. Director Sergio Martino admits that he padded out the first half after the film's running time came up short, and it shows: it's not until the halfway point that the film gets much in the way of energy. The Scope location photography in London and Greece is attractive and there's some amusement to be had from the terrible model work in a plane explosion or a sunglass wearing villain called Omar who looks like a hung over Charlton Heston in Touch of Evil after being dragged through a thorn bush, but overall the film is nothing to write home about.No complaints about the DVD presentation, which offers both Italian and dubbed English language soundtrack options, a retrospective featurette, brief stills and poster gallery and that wildly over the top trailer.",0.5,168,0.24291017802642417,0.2038912221448864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28701893009396623,0.0,0.062350445767540744,0.0,0.07009860111319166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05759286012296603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518796087299715,0.0,0.3064481972788909,0.09211126086287473,0.0,0.07490177115823547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09164823737853675,0.0,0.0,0.08167769597274004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20090575330179314,0.0,0.18478936679558722,0.08986635707985671,0.0,0.0,0.07514846904479702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724924260667517,0.0,0.0,0.09160644740766496,0.0,0.09196326769917511,0.06477115022318514,0.13429918475650607,0.0618172826753625,0.0,0.0,0.08217614252862292,0.09411700041181599,0.08012588545262622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282764568599599,0.0,0.0,0.1655529885373346,0.6222187445602314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786473591111198,0.0,0.0,0.0839245065598166,0.1342337420009033,0.0,0.0,0.08468679802331526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065000632032477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1845410491751548,0.07832475630637024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1283289,B002PTVMWO,A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0,1,2,1397865600,Disappointing but With Some Value,"This is a difficult documentary to review. On the one hand, I appreciate the opportunity to see so many clips that occurred at the time.On the other hand (and this almost had me give a 1 star), there are so many people who are shown and not identified--particularly the national newscasters who could have easily been ID'd with some research.  Also foreign broadcasters who say interesting things are unidentified. Often people like Police Chief Curry speak and are not identified. This is very frustrating when one is doing research about this.Also frustrating? The editing out of controversial moments, like the call back of SS riding on the bumper of the president's car when he left Love Field. That is a key moment, yet it's not shown here. Nor is the Zapruder film--there is no film, no still photo, of the actual assassination or even of the motorcade once it reached Main--Houston--Elm. The film of the search of the inside of the Depository was interesting, and the film of Oswald being asked questions is important. But the first hour is disappointing, including where they show Bobby Kennedy at the 1964 convention when he stands to give a speech about JFK--only the filmmakers do not show a word of the speech, only showing a title slide that says &#34;Delegates applauded for 22 minutes&#34;.However, the film is four hours long, showing elements of the investigations after the assassination, showing the making of JFK, including a discussion of the &#34;pristine bullet&#34;, one of the most troubling pieces of evidence.This is long and there is no narrative explanation or interpretation. I'm sure it was a great deal of work to compile all of this and that, in itself, is of great value.  I may come back to give it four stars, but with the lack of ID (and lack of so many important speeches--LBJ, Bobby,etc.)right now I can't. But for what it is, I will say, it is worth viewing, especially for those who were not alive at the time.",0.5,335,0.07850289639886325,0.04941966085588372,0.03329846731174618,0.09138004090507085,0.0,0.13913672236839017,0.12836274080067395,0.0,0.10740933311303777,0.0,0.0,0.04616062310096355,0.0,0.08375700292702515,0.0,0.03976672518386373,0.04659277851868718,0.0,0.0,0.044022279416966854,0.18569418805898755,0.04465231239446246,0.08129141277759701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510449823145711,0.044427854830045764,0.0,0.0318336102671637,0.07918897129557527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02434801775113954,0.0,0.3135279399730804,0.13069218505397973,0.0,0.0,0.07285869033427417,0.04523747181736297,0.14718803112779577,0.04471404855812358,0.0,0.04714302594839765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337417114797376,0.15699392272025708,0.4340235997128502,0.08990055911316723,0.09600881372387798,0.08849279507012621,0.07967223015267332,0.04562462466206438,0.03884222227117085,0.10093120372375401,0.0,0.0,0.04270907305947226,0.0,0.0,0.10369109486202992,0.10755563107439979,0.04015194098335913,0.0,0.0,0.10700571884851037,0.5467041023854077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437645349108276,0.03764022849823996,0.1262166434242322,0.08136732141879598,0.10845302600270558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039674645899658925,0.058088205532308985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04610457371215191,0.0392290729447579,0.12151769059780101,0.0,0.15187639183524848,0.04190884233042977,0.05707091584324835,0.0,0.0,

825200,B00026L91G,A2MLP4UGTF1RX4,15,15,1106006400,artful and true,"AKA is writer/director Duncan Roy's thought-provoking memoir of his own youth. He escaped from a brutal, sexually abusive working-class household by assuming the identity of a young aristocrat and became famous - or notorious, rather - in the process.Mr. Roy's movie is brilliantly written, directed, and cast. Matthew Leitch is perfect as Dean, the handsome, sweet, innocently seductive young man who desperately wants a better -- or, to be more precise, another -- life. His intelligence, looks, charm, and manner make people want to believe he is who he says. All the actors are notable and entertaining. Two are exceptional: Diana Quick as the prickly patrician Lady Gryffoyn, whose son Dean impersonates; and George Asprey as the striking, urbane, gay aristocrat who takes Dean under his wing. Heir to the Asprey fortune in real life, he was born for the part.Aside from the fascinating story, imaginative photography done solely with available light, and perfect musical support, AKA is a scathing portrayal of the English class system, where aristocrats rely on certain cues (accent, pronunciation, name, manners, schooling, demeanor) to identify one another and preserve their exclusivity. Dean lives as 'one of them' successfully and happily for over a year. After which he says, quite truthfully (if Mr. Roy's portrait of Alexander Gryffoyn is in any way accurate in its mean-spirited snobbery), that he was a better Lord Gryffoyn than the real one could ever be. Mr. Roy also depicts a working class equally complicit in maintaining 'place' and limited social mobility.After watching the single screen version, the three-screen triptych version, as it was released theatrically, is an interesting complement which adds dimension to the story. Mr. Roy's commentary track is illuminating politically, and enlightening cinematically. His film is a very personal work of art. The entire ensemble is outstanding, but the talent and beauty of Matthew Leitch form the solid core on which the story rests.",1.0,316,0.0,0.1401146428076148,0.047203914116610984,0.06477018240016348,0.051189870570775974,0.3099489584319249,0.09098352389316115,0.21423704134272448,0.0,0.09634392646201176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03957798153107345,0.05304820458302042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05264802384461816,0.0,0.07682581565985064,0.10294543140298773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33677490603603555,0.0,0.0,0.21810641735056727,0.0,0.052629355345643766,0.17257877488389414,0.0,0.31746948018206267,0.03087821140656566,0.07115310583582109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05583939518043774,0.0,0.0411007023880754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21534518050835988,0.08496203407168602,0.13610211410123846,0.0,0.11294336986732724,0.0,0.0,0.07154004758924153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17845313290995238,0.06303847591925983,0.037922832267489305,0.4810393539911478,0.06411358201240991,0.06753177434758982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15374303198971556,0.0,0.07028029967168327,0.0,0.05624278619556204,0.12351877818267828,0.0,0.06916697803760832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19022572121921863,0.16147500325043954,0.0,0.04045187102456692,0.0,0.0,
160913,0800105141,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,3,3,1001116800,An outstanding movie of the peaceful warrior,"A wonderful movie this is. Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 Acadaemy Award Winner for Best movie shows his direction and insight into the first leader of independent India Mohandras Gandhi. The movie is reafirming to those who choose peace and love instead of violence and hatred.Ben Kingsley gives a convincing and mesmorising portrayal of Mohandas Gandhi, the peaceful warrior. Kingsley rightly deserved the 1982 Oscar for Best Actor. From the moment you first see Gandhi in the movie you forget it is Ben Kingsley playing him, and start to think it is Gandhi. The movie is shot in some beautiful places in India as well as the not so beautiful places such as the riots in the large cities. Either way, the movie gives the important events in the history of India during and after British occupation in an unflinchingly manner.I consider Mohandras Gandhi a personal hero of mine and his hatred of violence but his refusal to kneel down to racism, opression of the poor and wrong doing in the name of greater empire glory is a message all of humanity should know about. His words and insight are so revelant to the world today even 50 years after his death. This is a movie that captures the insight of Gandhi, it shows the personal struggle of him and the people of India during the time of British occupation and its eventual freedom. Also shown is the tragic conflict at the time between the newly independent India and the new Islamic Nation of Pakistan and what Gandhi tried to do to bring the two cultures together peacefully. Unfortunately today there is still suspicion and hatred between the two nations. But we all should hope that peace will eventually spread throughout the two nations and the world.What an excellent movie this is and is highly recommended to everyone.",1.0,307,0.04295542203542145,0.10816632181956651,0.07288137289820837,0.050001571951531626,0.07903556549279646,0.34803748093021636,0.035118931642350235,0.09923259537420531,0.03918168157746695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328771087723236,0.06110717054943369,0.0,0.0,0.05098951903390172,0.0,0.0,0.048176454068883004,0.0,0.09773188056737174,0.059308333049274096,0.039736134781712174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123580188712173,0.21046844620700134,0.0,0.0,0.1865193765688609,0.051058982319417225,0.26958964316994966,0.07151249473906533,0.054929089423342015,0.0,0.0,0.04950631843842257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25383281646718386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03436173958821033,0.33248625026497214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055227802429971676,0.0,0.0,0.04673932662789866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07847009876107507,0.04394089007157961,0.0,0.0,0.05855167164772246,0.577663160051464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041723206454799086,0.0,0.06906355605830491,0.08904557135516798,0.1898995615874255,0.0,0.1627658899784111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05339582969908004,0.05195332782878742,0.04530813485093085,0.0,0.08586187066722342,0.0,0.0,0.041552062457370705,0.04586358190334526,0.0,0.0,0.06852888568087576,

That is especially true of horror directors.  After the masterpiece of A Nightmare On Elm Street, I thought that Wes Craven would never make another movie that matched it.  Well, he has done it again.  On all three of the Scream films, he has managed to keep me on the edge of my seat and keep me guessing who the killer is.  He managed to pull off not one...not two...but 3 great films without marching off into cheesy horror film territory.  With this box set you get all 3 Scream films which are loaded with extras but you also get a bonus 4th disc which has even more extras.  I would highly recommend these movies to anyone who is a horror or mystery fan.",1.0,143,0.0,0.11686885035121698,0.15749009709029765,0.10804890341888447,0.0,0.04700485741682378,0.07588885519193107,0.0,0.0,0.08035993739353545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13204710394499536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10410498769516412,0.08782685230739626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2099845260508645,0.0,0.1776089963488772,0.0,0.2730084559664305,0.07528091795897435,0.2809020906516673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11033387219595704,0.15887972488965185,0.10302138293831603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21148180133309205,0.09315066274701139,0.0,0.13712747620010607,0.11258338382510025,0.0,0.09140111119735696,0.0,0.14850526242136153,0.2565974667028628,0.21259909128325397,0.1513626964001838,0.0,0.09420544153483337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530498009547162,0.22290681698663908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049746712666966605,0.09620973865141869,0.20517794329683797,0.0,0.11724082023670197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790680763683599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2115549657589675,0.1795805454942053,0.0991070787998867,0.13496272956105093,0.20176114728129182,0.14808476336532272,

I would have thought that Spike would have matured and grown as a director but he still sucks as a director.  This movie is an utter mess.  Bad writing, matched with bad acting, bad music that did not match the scenes and actions -  made this move a waste of my valuable time. I felt like I was watching his movie - ""She's Got To Have It"" again. The actors spoke (lines and phrases) as if they were in THIS time period, not in this war time. The Germans did speak German very well but I believe the force and brutness of the delivery was not there.  So many things about this movie is not accurate and just distrubed my movie watching experience.  I believe this movie was directed by an amateur.  Spike Lee couldn't direct himself out of the bathroom, let alone out of this movie.  If you rent it for $1, you would have paid to much.

I absolutely adore Al Pacino and Christoper Walken (I don't know why anyone wouldn't)... didn't know much about Alan Arkin, but he, too, was great in the movie.  I really don't know what all to say about it other than I really enjoyed it!  Good action for these well aged classic gentlemen! Very likeable characters...

That's what this movie reminds me of. I assume that the script for Cat Run was interpreted from scrunched-up toilet paper after a bout of diarrhea brought on by food poisoning from cheap kebab meat. If you gave mentally subnormal 8-year-olds toy guns and told them to run riot in the back yard they'd come up with a better plot behind the gunplay than whoever was responsible for the script to his breathtakingly abysmal film.Cat (Paz Vega - who?) is at some political orgy shindig in Eastern Europe when everyone is suddenly killed and she finds herself marked for death and on the lam because &#34;she knows&#34;. Many characters come and go over the running time, most of which seem to be occupying their own story as the movie feels very disconnected.I've seen many poorly edited films in my time, but Cat Run wins the top prize by a million miles. Characters warp through space and time with no coherence or cohesion. Cat Run feels like three separate terrible movies chucked into a blender, fed to pigs, collected as faeces, then painted on the screen in brown smears. It is truly, mind-bogglingly, jaw-droppingly, agonizingly terrible.The worst part of this brain torture is that Cat Run actually thinks it is smart and funny. John Stockwell's &#34;direction&#34; makes you long for the crude, childish eye candy of Michael Bay. It will even make you forgive Guy Richie for all his previous sins. Nothing, but nothing about this drek can possibly be any worse. The worst part is that he plays the violence for laughs, which is just simply obscene.Shame on all involved. Who would want this on their resume? If you dropped Cat Run in a public toilet bowl it would regurgitate it back in your face.You honestly think that there are worse films than this? There's not. At least Tommy Wiseau's The Room had some shred of nobility, no matter house misguided.Do let this film come within a 100-mile radius of your life.Cat Run is presented on Blu-ray in 2.35:1 1080p. To say that it looks good is like saying that your last bowel movement looked like Jennifer Lawrence. The sound is in DTS HD-MA, but I'd rather listen to the sound of nails being hammered into my ears.

I agree with everyone who says he stole the movie. I loved how he just camped it up, he was almost going quite Python-esque in some scenes, just with his little mannerisms and quirks. I understand the director gave him free reign to play with the character however he wanted, and we should all be thankful for that!

915741,B0009X770E,A2TYXDI7PVCZ7M,0,0,1371859200,Needs More Lugosi!,"I'm in my late 20's and find myself drawn more to the horror, sci-fi and psychological thriller genres of the 20's, 30's and 40's than those of today.  That being the case, I've become quite familiar with Bela Lugosi and he is one of my favorite actors of that era.  I was quite excited to run across this set, but while there are a handful of gems, there are some downfalls here that dampen its potential.This collection contains five Universal Studios Lugosi films that span from 1932 to 1940.  This is a single, two-sided disc that has a total feature running time of 5 hours and 37 minutes.  The first side is what I call the ""Poe Side,"" as it has Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Black Cat and The Raven.  These are undoubtedly the best offerings here and showcase why Lugosi is a legend.  The second side is where I lost a good deal of interest.  The Invisible Ray and Black Friday are good films for what they are, but neither of them (especially Black Friday,)feature Lugosi for more than a few minutes and are carried by Boris Karloff.  I'm just as big a fan of Karloff and he does a good job with the roles, but I am disappointed from the perspective that this is a Lugosi collection.  Ideally, Black Friday would have been replaced with Dracula or Son of Frankenstein.I'm basing my four star rating on the fact that The Black Cat and The Raven are two of my favorite movies and the acting supremely illuminates both Lugosi and Karloff.  In addition, even if the final two movies aren't necessarily Lugosi films so to speak, they're still enjoyable to watch.",0.0,284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35311821044258646,0.3069799876899198,0.08261022781140868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06308188997569933,0.06448955577683901,0.11446011098638395,0.05113873210397511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06015968589909761,0.0,0.06102067234810008,0.07406046701448579,0.09923990602936615,0.0,0.14909166853322683,0.0,0.0,0.10517653586928644,0.04350297213298656,0.10821755944737277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050734959363492683,0.09982007653217953,0.0,0.18362529128929508,0.029766748816145546,0.06859194663241261,0.052336261274262205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765890734384653,0.0,0.0,0.13011828075342438,0.0,0.21127372519604692,0.0,0.0,0.3262188618475194,0.04095191094168954,0.043734370820633216,0.0,0.05443898412741122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04899422949629818,0.05487058348157702,0.0,0.12153880635989532,0.25590458765503604,0.463724321088454,0.0,0.06510096513186955,0.0,0.10420256299623142,0.10287628689902119,0.1149895571697528,0.05559721763429478,0.148209044727811,0.0,0.20325167149470372,0.0,0.0,0.03969090475945543,0.0629976487380078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721883272404292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169874123935203,0.058296377127605756,0.0,
1140083,B0012Z5UMA,A233UR4B7OT4RR,1,2,1289174400,Respectable season,"Season 6 kicks off with the return of Sean Cameron.  The last viewers saw this character was back in mid-season 4 in Back in Black.  In the season opener, he and his ex Emma Nelson begin to rekindle their high school romance; but there is a problem, Peter Stone is determined to keep these two apart in the first 3 episodes.Degrassi also gets new rivals and newbies in Mia (played by Nina Dorbev) and Johnny.  Both characters later become heavily linked later in the season when Degrassi looses one of its beloved characters.Meanwhile, Jimmy and Spinner restore their friendship after a couple of seasons due to the school shooting that paralyzed Jimmy.  Spinner and Darcy are back together, but not for long.  Jimmy and Ashley are together, while Jimmy is aimed to satisfy Ashley more than just on a emotional level.  Alex also returns back to Degrassi for a fast-track to improve her grades to get into college. Later in the season, Alex has to set her pride to the side to make quick cash when things go terribly wrong at home.The graduates, who actually went to college, start embarking on their new journey post-Degrassi but not without its share of problems.  Ellie is a freshman reporter of her college paper which leads to her developing a relationship with head-editor Jesse.  Ellie though can't seem to get over Craig, who also is dealing more than with his fair share of bad habits.  Marco becomes warily that his boyfriend Dylan could be cheating and Marco becomes addicted to a new activity which could have him losing more than just fair share of winnings.  Paige returns midway in the season facing the possibilities she has failed at her dream college.  Paige and Alex take on their relationship for the second time, where there seems to be more angst and heartache from the last break-up.  Can these two make it through the storm or will the pain be much too serve to restore?All in all I found this season to be decent.  Season 6 didn't leave up to any huge expectations like previous seasons.  The show didn't pick up for me until Rock this Town and the graduates got most of the story towards the end of the season.  Yet this is only my opinion, if you are a Degrassi buff, I would recommend you purchasing this season to add to your collection.",0.5,400,0.0,0.052805677977687995,0.0711598627575485,0.14646149720733975,0.0,0.21238536673207623,0.10286819209697425,0.0,0.07651236448458988,0.14523839204570432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08949566323084536,0.03998506297948825,0.084982731484541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04771169183327952,0.11581485563011593,0.038797538865401895,0.09487879130851673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223689242328559,0.03401470879246099,0.042307325113105025,0.2554314178133391,0.05485202106272629,0.12329821860904765,0.0,0.03966935553440015,0.2601623650374835,0.04985293264802293,0.14357549619926163,0.023274439493107188,0.10726325010977435,0.0818428074793688,0.038925323171351944,0.0,0.0,0.04777765788649412,0.1683556871020655,0.05037305809087709,0.0,0.0,0.047450209102692244,0.04129840954356769,0.0,0.06710018145851306,0.20869244183190885,0.0960601487814302,0.03419563801612869,0.04727796547861457,0.04256550992402676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054314355021117054,0.055397775597911245,0.0,0.0,0.0448363258435036,0.14254567800600057,0.057168639296851106,0.40287024511507313,0.19330234715821792,0.0,0.0,0.08147534896948551,0.0,0.1123870424688,0.04347112564448559,0.4635349953942766,0.05167784685350285,0.1059474955157685,0.13159792967064265,0.0,0.0310340765448178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656236441352592,0.09558837417221602,0.0811411460618155,0.04478025130467683,0.0914717447990593,0.045581582002932025,0.06691018440047428,

488041,7883706837,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,12,17,1214784000,A Robotic Love Story with Themes That Do Compute,"As original as Pixar's `Wall-E' is, two films came to my mind.  One is a quaint science fiction movie from the seventies, 'Silent Running' starring Bruce Dern, about a lone scientist who keeps the last forest safe on a vessel in outer space.  Significantly, that film had the first robots in memory with two definable personalities, even a few years before 'Star Wars'.  The other film is '2001 - A Space Odyssey,' a science fiction classic that upped the quality of science fiction on the big screen and provided the big budgets we now take for granted.  In that film there was a space station run by a computer with a mind of its own creating a real human disaster and mutiny within the wastes of space.  Unabashedly, they even use some of that soundtrack here.Entering 'Wall-E' I was impressed by the animation and the fluid action scenes.  There are still plenty of new tricks to celebrate in this film, but the real chemistry comes from its two main characters.  This time we follow the titled character (Ben Burtt), a dirty, worn robot who works like a trash compactor at the city dump.  He gathers metal refuse and crushes it on his insides only to spit out building blocks for more city structures.  We learn quickly about his personality when he goes home to a storage room like structure where he likes to unwind his circuits and watch an old videotape of `Hello, Dolly! Widescreen Edition'.  A cockroach is his only companion, one of the few signs of life among the bleak city skyline.  Partly endearing, partly a nuisance, some heart comes to the movie as we see him follow Wall-E around like a pet dog.Enter a space rocket.  It's a source of fear and fascination for Wall-E who's never seen such a thing.  Out of the alien craft comes a probe; one that mechanically searches the data of everything it meets and destroys anything threatening on its sensors.  As the tape gives him new meaning, he overcomes his fear and tries to meet this new robot, whom he learns to call ""Eva"" or ""Eve"".  Wall-E tries to impress her using anything from bubble wrap to egg beaters; his clumsiness showing his softer side. Love blossoms, but is not received until one day the rocket returns and picks Eve up.  Determined not to let a good thing go, Wall-E attaches his mechanical arms to the ship for dear life as he discovers a ""brave new world"" of comfy humans on a displaced technological ""cruise ship"" sent out for a five year journey.  Chaos ensues when Eve returns with a plant found in her inner workings after Wall-E gave it to her as a gift.  It doesn't fit the cruise control they're accustomed to.Without being heavy handed or cynical, `Wall-E' charms us with its contrast.  We get all the themes implied here, but we receive it in such a glowing way, it never leaves the residue of desolation the movie so warmly, yet desperately, persuades us to leave behind.  Although the movie is received differently by children and adults, there's plenty for everyone to appreciate in this wholehearted movie offering.(Anyone familiar with 1981's 'Heartbeeps,' starring Bernadette Peters and Andy Kaufman, knows that this movie idea has been done before.  Without the careful care of Pixar's craftmanship and imagination, 'Heartbeeps' demonstates that, in the wrong hands, these movie ideas can sometimes bring disastrous results.)(More traditional is ""Presto,"" which continues Disney's admirable throwback to fine pre-feature animated entertainment.)",0.7058823529411765,585,0.06670965244602738,0.04199550017805821,0.028296142986440904,0.0,0.030685504035741898,0.20268796950621512,0.02726980219406418,0.15410794807863307,0.03042452193960954,0.0,0.0,0.039226057445212056,0.0,0.07117445102654393,0.09539841833964961,0.03379269476190496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07481790085468204,0.12623834599653505,0.03794433552631524,0.13815851750709598,0.09256516227394962,0.03772778278667615,0.030903102600655378,0.0,0.03775359751793601,0.032700834102199074,0.0,0.2018779813872992,0.12188428096835587,0.087245847360577,0.2614855351344791,0.0,0.0,0.16552233116858536,0.0,0.13321381036347335,0.12956849257820058,0.17060945002874314,0.0,0.09287003663872223,0.03844158828408452,0.0,0.0,0.06694527519047545,0.0,0.1724632292398854,0.0,0.0,0.032843956024449346,0.0,0.05336368720764033,0.2581751167520749,0.12732513338683568,0.10878094760960567,0.07519879996671214,0.06770332085685568,0.038770580370978976,0.09902123106805542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036293022942917065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030465961965407806,0.06824008159964084,0.0,0.0,0.1591285242042792,0.4485546505180432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719403755031171,0.06397131000998334,0.08937959406570188,0.03457188193880881,0.3133455911950499,0.0,0.12638749005392705,0.03488590047236138,0.0,0.04936179657098422,0.03917367392229896,0.04146178843680808,0.24205012629243933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0688416460002154,0.03800994266436413,0.09679535831336031,0.0,0.12124332780461283,0.0,0.0,

With the less than impressive Backlash getting stinker ratings, the WWF obviously tried to pick up the pace with Judgment Day, and they succeeded admirably. This was nothing short of an amazing ppv. The chain match, no holds barred match, tag team turmoil, hardcore match, and even the women's title match was a little impressive (if you pause it just right, you'll see a clear blooper on Chyna's outfit). All in all, excellent, solid, and entertaining. Here are the matches:1. William Regal vs. Rikishi - great opener, Regal gets a stink face.2. 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS (PINFALL, SUBMISSION, AND LADDER) Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit - another classic and runner up for best match of 20013. HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP Test vs. Big Show vs. Rhyno - solid and very hardcore, with an impressive gore from Rhyno.4. WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Chyna vs. Lita - good match, not as disappointing as Chyna's WrestleMania and Royal Rumble matches.5. INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP CHAIN MATCH Kane vs. Triple H - very brutal, a classic with a good ending. This is another runner up for match of 2001.6. TAG TEAM TURMOIL NO. 1 CONTENDER'S MATCH Acolytes vs. Radicalz vs. Dudley Boyz vs. X-Factor vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Chris Jericho &amp; Chris Benoit vs. Edge &amp; Christian - good match between seven great teams.7. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker - great main event, extremely brutal and entertaining No Holds Barred match. Get this tape as soon as its availible. Well worth the money. Hopefully, WWF will continue with more ppvs like these.",0.9473684210526315,268,0.0,0.0,0.14134462941852866,0.0,0.1532799434372042,0.33748835134147814,0.0681089307345452,0.2565995280942473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10015702666455553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934324200584925,0.0,0.0,0.1725320343784248,0.07706343914638143,0.09422873427167791,0.2315503346374175,0.23910148860917255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07879512607248336,0.05167597526172901,0.0,0.04753059875201745,0.046229951795799896,0.10652834160634149,0.08128206579850558,0.07731725674341014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360110349362274,0.10005585947785947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2838519933954278,0.06664044810263131,0.18423341917202368,0.06360133182409626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08243832157965561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09064528477967664,0.0,0.0,0.11003644131771409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437935587190169,0.0,0.3200880006953153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988722271363717,0.13394043428656185,0.0,0.04603591098099284,0.0,0.0,0.26139258678614385,0.16841009736266338,0.1849286892325356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786966100506834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889468835471681,0.3028167698725589,0.0,0.13290350559883887,

After a couple of weeks of inactivity I couldn't stand it and went to Amazon to see what my options were.  Jodi Stolove's ""Chair Dancing"" was about $10 cheaper than other chair exercise alternatives, so I've started here.  She is super-cutesy and the music is pretty bad in places, but I grit my teeth and bear it, because the exercise routine is actually pretty effective and it gets my heart rate up!The others in the video are of all ages and athletic ranges - male and female, from young teenage girls to elderly couples, from thin and athletic to fairly heavy.The legs are involved quite a bit, so I would echo what another reviewer said - if you don't have use of your lower limbs, this DVD may not be for you.  You could do the upper limb part, of course, but that's half of what Jodi has to offer - she's serious about the ""dancing"" part, incorporating cha-cha and such into her routines.  I was able to use my left leg while keeping my right leg still so as not to jostle my healing ankle, and my left leg got quite a workout.  Using just the upper body, you would certainly work those muscle groups -- but again, Jodi is serious about the ""dancing"" part.  (Though ""serious"" is the wrong word for this DVD, ""dorky"" being a more accurate term - one star docked for dorkiness.)",0.6666666666666666,260,0.186171943631274,0.07813345950440194,0.052645534230759905,0.0,0.057090987767338945,0.28282873504833866,0.10147201373428115,0.04778681473592545,0.0,0.05372517908103726,0.07632349100454512,0.0,0.0,0.13242147524024667,0.0,0.06287197762924705,0.07366410271821996,0.07600355848685351,0.1459084821394004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852332853591006,0.11481287800494455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084054925530539,0.0503295663226354,0.0,0.07558937259854234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05869641491057859,0.11548409030075092,0.07376445570636948,0.17703352252588872,0.10331346241160205,0.0,0.12109799417058455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06227650493419975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020928683023667,0.4888546434013355,0.0,0.14892629480892133,0.20585996401924717,0.0,0.050597276665765085,0.0,0.0,0.07213343235665956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06752388771129188,0.0,0.16073152058925483,0.0,0.22673010159603302,0.0,0.0,0.07030548851656529,0.042294538527747234,0.2980517170476185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06651700171535192,0.0,0.24005292541429368,0.07646467404715322,0.0,0.06490590849673927,0.0,0.09183859978071233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07289224128047123,0.1860658164730941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04511512234899004,0.13488877817561531,0.19800613810868897,

367966,6303276865,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,2,2,1227225600,Okay Event With Two Classic Matches,"This review is really of the actual PPV, which I still have in its original form on VHS. I don't know what the Turner Home Entertainment version has on it. This event was original dedicated to the legends of pro wrestling and had many future stars on here. This is what I remember from memory:2 Cold Scorpio & Marcus Bagwell Vs. ""Beautiful"" Bobby Eaton & Chris Benoit - This was 1993 and while Bobby Eaton was nearing the end of his career, the other three in this match were at or not too far from the beginning of theirs. We pretty much know what happened to all of them (particularly Benoit) so no need to rehash.To the match itself, it was a good opener with rivals Scorpio and Benoit starting it off. Nasty ending when 2 Cold attempted a twisting summersault into a legdrop on Benoit but landed a**-first on Benoit's face! Ouch! Talk about a botched spot!? Anyway, it ended after that part.Dick Murdoch, Don Muraco & ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka Vs. Jim Brunzell, Wahoo McDaniel and Blackjack Mulligan - This six man was the first of three matches with legends of the game! Two of which (McDaniel and Murdoch) are no longer with us at the time I write this. Not a good six man but considering their ages at this point, I am amazed they could do what they did do! Ends in a double DQ when it got all out of control!""Thunderbolt"" Patterson & Brad Armstrong Vs. Baron Von Rashke & Ivan Koloff - Probably the best of the legends matches as Patterson was comical in some of his moves! Brad, by the way, was a fill in for his father ""Bullet"" Bob Armstrong who couldn't make it due to an injury. Ends when Patterson got in his pattened double chop to the throat of Rashke for the pin.Nick Bockwinkle Vs. Dory Funk, Jr. - In sort of an AWA Vs. NWA match, Bockwinkle took on the more saner of the Funk Brothers with respective cornermen. Verne Gange for Bockwinkle and the late Gene Kinski for Funk. The match, for the most part, was clean and was mostly wrestling. Ended in a draw.Sting Vs. The Prisoner (Nailz for WWE fans) - Not a good match at all. Pretty much a throw away. By the way, Sting won.""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff & ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude Vs. Dustin Rhodes & Kensuki Sasaki - Pretty good tag team encounter. A bit sloppy at times but it especially picked up when Rhodes and the late Rick Rude got it on! Ends when Rude gets in his pattened ""Rude Awakening"" neckbreaker on Sasaki for the pin.The Hollywood Blondes (""Stunning"" Steve Austin & the late Brian Pillman) Vs. Ricky Steamboat & ""Shane Douglas"" (cage match for the WCW/NWA World Tag Team Titles) - I put Shane in quotation marks because it wasn't actually Douglas in that match. It was actually Tom Zenk (I think) playing Douglas due to the fact that Shane was fired prior to this bout. I do know it wasn't Douglas in the match though he is credited for it.Anyway, it was still a good match which was more of a display for Austin and Pillman. At that time, I really didn't appreciate the Blondes but now I agree that they definitely didn't get the shot they deserved and WCW was dumb to split them up! One high spot was Steamboat using his famous flying body press on both Austin and Pillman at the same time and nearly pinning them both! Ends when Austin used his Stun Gun to drop Zenk into both the top rope and I believe part of the cage! Great match.Barry Windham Vs. Arn Anderson (NWA World Title Match) - A classic NWA style match with both men taking punishment from the other. Windham, by the way, bleeds like a pig in this one! Ends when Windham clobbers Anderson with his NWA title belt while the ref is down, winning this battle of former Horsemen.Vader Vs. ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith (WCW World Title Match) - Was a pretty good bout but the best parts of this match is within the first 10 minutes. Impressive shows of strength by Davey Boy Smith in this one as he used his vertical suplex and even lifted Vader in the ""electric chair""! Remember, Vader (at this time) was 450lbs. so this wasn't no easy feat by any means!It ends when Vader, after nearly being pinned by Davey but saved by Harley Race, hits The Bulldog with a chair causing a DQ.Overall, not a bad card but it wasn't a classic. Best bouts were the cage match along with Anderson Vs. Windham. Not a must buy but not a bad buy either.",1.0,793,0.02413953061652479,0.06078590579524918,0.061435392172374904,0.0,0.044415381402479366,0.17113738848205345,0.019735681444384093,0.037176964097299946,0.1761505034249228,0.0,0.029688897455676145,0.0,0.08706643099591822,0.13736085872008208,0.16109723946359283,0.0,0.08596328455293228,0.059128895297734865,0.0,0.02707357844214442,0.0,0.0823831408717575,0.16664663663150928,0.06699119203307011,0.027304323565751114,0.13419102585989592,0.023094527943089287,0.027323006184315466,0.02366622391368615,0.019577581081195453,0.048700995371384094,0.0,0.0,0.21289738683759696,0.0,0.0,0.2246094400016938,0.057386928520073946,0.06886385865362538,0.20093831865907757,0.03086833682553954,0.0,0.022403945162328784,0.0,0.030173408853119112,0.0,0.048449585954585365,0.028992828811178654,0.0,0.0,0.0546210947561327,0.0,0.0822507776673142,0.11586098688207433,0.25357713234714846,0.1658657755603337,0.059045151316922305,0.0,0.024499099106935835,0.056118032552658945,0.023887857817749693,0.0,0.0,0.053137525403167914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04409760774699628,0.024693331154459906,0.0,0.0,0.08226027142879609,0.4985353134930421,0.027814381697089333,0.0878918860603667,0.0,0.0,0.09259454006687168,0.1940572047669291,0.10008134918201976,0.13339661397181163,0.029743815919432252,0.03048968751232222,0.05049519712122283,0.0,0.3036547103853082,0.0,0.09002008627126087,0.02919605694292089,0.0,0.05670836719356668,0.09650307959048299,0.1992881042405279,0.08252558432269964,0.023350888813112536,0.0,0.1403938130701789,0.0,0.0,
425536,6304490135,A3P9EH5DY3GEEO,12,13,1343779200,Adequate but not great Blu-ray,"I don't review often, but I felt the need to in this case.  This is one of the rare times I've really had a hard time distinguishing between my prior high-bitrate DVD and a Blu-ray.  Yeah, it's a little sharper, but nothing that makes you think ""WOW! Now THIS is HD!""  Part of that, I'd have to attribute to the original film.  This is a movie I saw five times--my personal best, ever--in the theater, and I do remember that the print seemed a bit grainy, like the film stock they'd used wasn't all that spectacular.  I do support the natural treatment of film, though, so I'm glad they didn't attempt to sharpen the film and use DNR to give it that glossy, HD look.Overall, it's worth the $10 you'd pay for it.  The commentary track is from one of the old DVD's and fully illustrates that Arnold is perhaps one of the funniest, and worst, celebrity commentators ever.  He simply doesn't understand what's expected of him.  Verhoeven, however, is terrific both in the commentary and the supplementary interview, which was clearly filmed more recently and in HD.Overall, I gave the Bluray three stars.  The film itself I give four and a half, but I think the reviews should be more about the quality of the disc than about what you thought of the film.  (That's what Rottentomatoes is for.)",0.9230769230769231,230,0.1166423742201619,0.0,0.04947603799737978,0.0,0.0,0.23626771761099782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05049068340684335,0.0,0.0,0.07011759664793514,0.12444911114279257,0.0,0.0,0.1384583896196861,0.07142780489507368,0.13712414000447273,0.0,0.33109317440775377,0.0,0.08052376685070033,0.053950315043456744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06601247478252618,0.0,0.04729950169857763,0.05883088425831574,0.0,0.07627503969699943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470857654055613,0.0,0.23292543957235481,0.12945804087926363,0.0,0.0,0.05412800681889465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170543625205796,0.0,0.04307905289480711,0.0,0.0,0.11485585275905605,0.0,0.0,0.25795503330662384,0.0,0.14265328405101435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641902199929972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05326998427133821,0.0,0.0,0.06607278418000248,0.27823752918447353,0.5602153456433604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185436002047139,0.12502476240112512,0.06044921900716536,0.1611433338719425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04315475299823063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17486382350086405,0.0,0.06646069637269834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956396334357965,
1476460,B005LAIHXQ,AOCKNOHKU0PMD,0,2,1356307200,The worst Scifi movie I ever saw in the cinema,"I am a huge scifi fan and I watched a lot of movies but this one is the worst. I saw it twice (one time in the cinema and now again - I wasn't myself at the second time). The movie has great visuals and the most actors played well (Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbinder,...) but the script and the story of this movie are crap. I can't believe that Ridley Scott is responsbile for it. The same director of movies like Gladiator, Alien and Black Hawk Down.The theory of ancient aliens (I don't mind) mixed with modern creationism (bulls***) are the concept for this movie. Furthermore the script of this movie is science hostile. All the scientists on board of the Prometheus act stupid or say stupid things. The only survivor - of course - a believer.In addition this movie don't fit to the other Alien parts and you have not a complete storyline. If you saw the other Alien movies you have after this part more open questions than before.Therefore don't waste your time and money to buy this product.",0.0,181,0.0,0.08925963211340461,0.06014223672748723,0.0,0.0,0.251302668552992,0.11592158689988628,0.0,0.0646660147882854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085215935939983,0.0,0.07182492147442451,0.0,0.2604793021918083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978833318945281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782523155866192,0.0,0.06950421853265154,0.114992951876975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06705476033604822,0.08795265161754406,0.0,0.12134581414389331,0.07868350474273757,0.0,0.0,0.06579709151046831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114465371166782,0.0851476736179519,0.26183084802916556,0.25795970591250106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056711112716517395,0.27437006160681265,0.05412482059607472,0.11560461624950578,0.07991590994200402,0.07195025046631265,0.16481040711808867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578870499113494,0.08031696126533677,0.04831726347891003,0.5447906550292229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26596148423743876,0.22044315106920218,0.07835324674377632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477720200719722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05153949728023006,0.0,0.169651598264203,

Hoping that it would get better I finished seeing the film it went from promising to boring to straight out pathetic. I found that her boyfriend was not dead instead it was her two friend (Dushku and whats his face) and that she was in limbo the whole time while trying to be rivied in the operating table. When you read this it may sound good be when you see the film it's just anti-climatic. The performance where some what stale even though they are all good actors they fall short in this film. I would not recomend this movie to anyone and i'm sad to see many suffered seein this movie just like I have.,0.3333333333333333,138,0.0,0.0,0.06914510766991021,0.0,0.0,0.1650976658034094,0.06663711763646588,0.0,0.0,0.1411262454232258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05797451007057013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141337412509935,0.3084789340435723,0.0,0.0,0.07539812186867009,0.18438496046487707,0.1510310686287188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06610329505071638,0.0,0.19855949354098626,0.0,0.07987151062276195,0.0,0.0,0.15167781986988482,0.0,0.0,0.3166165570424448,0.0,0.15905117058614304,0.07564645454529553,0.0,0.10187988699070875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12041003569796534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13040073692742563,0.04506304787614152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065685474151786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773729359691906,0.0,0.10555309637829459,0.0,0.0,0.08337651869853155,0.0,0.0,0.16665005663338114,0.3131709971998773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15632176867868827,0.17472803012416965,0.08448064812776215,0.36032871254416415,0.0,0.10294779530077212,0.0,0.0,0.24124324932316238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08146015992751715,0.1682230340417664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1771641075866603,0.13003150161622726,

1035315,B000KLQUV2,A3M2WW0PO34B94,11,12,1173312000,The Scariest Horror Film I Have Seen In Many Years,"I enjoy going to thrillers and horror films, looking for the next great `edge of your seat' film experience. More often than not, I am left wanting, as the filmmakers resort to a series of cheap thrills trying to scare the audience with graphic, disgusting images, robbing their films of any impact. Well, I recently saw one of the scariest films I have ever seen. It not only left me on the edge of my seat, but is also filled with graphic, disgusting images and is all the more impactful because the film is a documentary about real people who run a camp for children. You horror devotees out there are probably saying to yourself ""oooh sounds promising"". Then you better hurry out and rent the new documentary ""Jesus Camp"", truly one of the scariest films I have seen in some time.The documentary follows Pastor Becky Fischer, an Evangelical Christian Children's Pastor, as she meets with a group of children at a church. She is there to meet with and talk with the kids, but she is also there to sell her summer camp, located at Devil's Lake, South Dakota. Every summer, she and a small staff, welcome children from around the country, and their parents, for a summer camp devoted to training children to become the next wave of Evangelical warriors.At this initial meeting, Pastor Becky meets three children who will end up coming to the summer camp; Levi, a young boy with a mullet, who believes so strongly in God and the message of his church, his wardrobe exists almost exclusively of t-shirts proclaiming his love of God, Rachael, a young woman, who loves to dance, but feels her body movements might lead to temptation and move her away from the church, even though she dances to Christian rock and Tory, the youngest of the group, doesn't hesitate to approach strangers and ask them if they are Christians and give them pamphlets about the church and their message. These three children all attend Pastor Becky's summer camp and we are invited along for the experience.The beauty of ""Jesus Camp"" is that the directors, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, have been given access to a world most of us will never see. Pastor Becky lets them in and they film some of the meetings and seminars. They talk to each of the participants and we hear their own words. There are a few half-hearted attempts to show the `other side' of the argument, but these aren't really necessary.The horror of the film isn't a `liberal' or `conservative' thing; it has nothing to do with that. The horror comes from watching these children soak up these messages like a sponge, frequently with their parents in attendance, and never learning the `other side' of the argument, for comparison's sake, if nothing else.After we meet the three children, we follow one of them home and learn that she is being home schooled. Her mother doesn't believe the school system promotes an ideology that they want their kids to learn. Her number one objection? There is no prayer in school. As the mother talks about the home schooling, we listen to her teaching her daughter about `Creationism' and the lack of evidence supporting global warming. I didn't realize global warming, as an idea, was something Evangelical Christians were against. Why? This doesn't make any sense. Yet, they seem to believe this very strongly.We meet Levi, whose parents will accompany him to camp and the family will take a road trip after the camp to Colorado and Washington, DC, bringing Tory along for the ride. Levi wears bright colorful t-shirts, as any kid his age would. Yet, his bright orange t-shirt with the Reese's peanut butter cup symbol is filled with the word `Jesus'. All of his t-shirts are like this. Levi is being groomed to be the next Ted Haggart (who appears in the documentary, more on that later) and I have no doubt he will one day end up with a television ministry. His beliefs and conviction are so strong, we just know he will one day take a wrong turn and start preaching on television.And the cameras roll as Pastor Becky talks about her mission. At one point, she explains how Muslim people train their children to be warriors, why shouldn't Christians train their children to be warriors. During her visit to the church, she leads a prayer session and many of the children seem to become consumed with guilt and start crying, and shaking, and pleading for God's forgiveness. For what? They are 9 and 10 years old. What could they have done that would require God's forgiveness?At the camp, Pastor Becky promises a fun time for all and shows us some of the props she uses to illustrate the various messages she portrays. At one point, she picks up a Ken doll and a Barbie, both of which are covered in leaves. You can probably guess the message. She goes on to show us more of the props she has accumulated and explains how she will use them. This is both frightening and numbing. Some of the messages she wants to present, and the props she wants to use are truly perplexing. Others are simplistic.She also has guest speakers. At one point, a man addresses the group and shows them a collection of small baby doll fetuses, in various sizes. He is there to talk about how all children, no matter the size, or the age, are God's children and God has a plan for them all. He then goes on to place a piece of duck tape with the word ""LIFE"" written on the front, over many of the people's mouths. This discussion is also pretty graphic. Again, the audience is 9 and 10 year olds, and he tells them about leading protests at birth control clinics, what happens during an abortion, etc.This session is followed by a group activity where the children smash mugs with the word `Government' printed on them and they bless a cardboard cut out of President George W. Bush.These scenes are riveting, interesting and scary.""Jesus Camp"" is not a perfect documentary. There are moments when the filmmakers simply film long stretches of highway, filled with fast food and chain restaurants, presumably in Pastor Becky's car. The idea is to draw parallels between the proliferation of strip malls, chain stores and the spreading of the type of large churches featured in the documentary. The parallel is made the first time they do this, yet they revisit this idea at least two more times. Perhaps they intended this as a sort of break between ideas or acts, but it doesn't really work that way.These moments also include radio commentary about the confirmation hearings for Associate Justice Alito as he was being considered for the Supreme Court.There are also a couple of moments with Mike Papantino, a radio talk show host who seems to have a show discussing religion on Air America. Mike appears to be a knowledgeable man and also seems to be amazed when members of the religious right call in. These moments are meant to be a sort of counterpoint to the Pastor Becky scenes and we see there can be a more moderate view of religion and how it fits into modern life. But these scenes are nowhere near as powerful as the scenes of the kids at camp. This is okay, because we really don't need them. The scenes of Pastor Becky and the children talking more than adequately convey the danger of teaching the children these messages. If the counterpoint isn't going to be as strong, they shouldn't be included. They may end up diluting the central message.Towards the end of the film, Mike Papantino gets a call from Pastor Becky and is able to pepper her with some hard questions. During the talk, she states that they don't talk about government at her camp, and this is moments after we have watched her children break mugs with the word `government' on them and then pray to the cardboard cutout of President Bush. Did she not remember these moments at her camp? Did she forget the cameras were rolling?Remember Levi? At camp, he is asked to preach to the group and spends an afternoon ruminating about the message he wants to present, what he wants to say, etc. Levi's parents attend the camp, along with his younger brother, and they make a regular family vacation out of it. After camp, they travel to Boulder, Colorado and visit Reverand Ted Haggart's extremely large church. The boys are mesmerized as Taggart leads his large sermon and we watch the director putting together the televised broadcast. This was clearly shot before Haggart was outed and confessed to having sex with male prostitutes. Now, he is apparently fighting with the film's producers and Distribution Company over his portrayal.Then the family travels to Washington, DC where they continue the protest over abortion, meeting at the Supreme Court and once again covering their mouths with tape and the word `LIFE"".These scenes are interesting, but they don't really fit with the overall theme of the rest of the documentary. The film is called ""Jesus Camp"", not ""Jesus Summer Vacation"". I would have preferred more exposure to the activities at the camp, even though what I did see made me ill to my stomach.Overall, ""Jesus Camp"" is a very effective, very interesting documentary I won't soon forget. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary, but didn't win, it was up against ""An Inconvenient Truth"".""Jesus Camp"" is a necessary viewing experience.",0.9166666666666666,1605,0.10383133580127679,0.05229166960098844,0.052850396605195644,0.08460424396545384,0.06686534046751436,0.31021907358425327,0.15280031578778824,0.09594554023224368,0.14206424280177918,0.08090136410256905,0.025540164224898004,0.01221080846148684,0.012483291379835098,0.05908301066116521,0.009898962490272242,0.021038878236052633,0.024650251922976832,0.03814965759326869,0.0,0.023290310480553987,0.07859430000639772,0.011811817028957625,0.10035157861334945,0.03841988515966651,0.0,0.0,0.009933646698123286,0.0,0.04071820088577869,0.06736722193021574,0.10473876821782602,0.16441428803495461,0.013579523415883834,0.10174836552960297,0.050491043531201006,0.029462411699819696,0.07084823759383452,0.012341916544335611,0.15402609951005405,0.04033380228756848,0.0,0.010130769104358343,0.019273212809123322,0.011966608475703135,0.02595696989031561,0.023656296029048705,0.08335845975794864,0.012470682184937222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020448206230881366,0.03537851771668184,0.04152939434464677,0.275548050498375,0.07134382732510466,0.07619125281948623,0.011704440909078226,0.031613384203001034,0.02413804300939204,0.041099526350359454,0.040048796365760336,0.0,0.04571207561101699,0.033893323507973465,0.014046723443286805,0.2689283062093347,0.05485853584570353,0.01896769904414373,0.053106698715088156,0.0,0.023526357337583365,0.05661216202757879,0.5236201977762309,0.10767417174659312,0.13861806578851124,0.05171755664724668,0.09076755504550045,0.17922455581675692,0.07234049644341363,0.03228598457269571,0.29262713962612164,0.0,0.013114525849151253,0.0651584803192849,0.03148524452096945,0.046097988110457254,0.012194501822316612,0.01290677651659714,0.1381390634614188,0.010951828526692712,0.024391963581871016,0.05188607341829137,0.02142994244721674,0.011832240090784329,0.06026349102130833,0.07760263369802593,0.17361427804889032,0.03385341951761512,0.02484708124396097,

The story is sweet and meaningful, and the acting is absolutely exquisite. This film is lovely and quiet, beautifully filmed, and restrained.One of the things that impressed me about the movie is the obvious acting talents of Zhang Ziyi, the actress who played Jen in Crouching Tiger. If you think you'll even recognize her in this role, I challenge you to see the movie to find even one remnant of Jen in her character. She is an excellent actress and conveys realms of thought and feeling without saying a single word.If you're hoping for a fast-paced, run-of-the-mill movie you won't absorb, see something else.

20826,0767835980,A38QJ7JUUTVLKX,3,4,1071446400,Great movie!!!,"Finally a good movie. Hadn't seen one of these in a while. This movie is a perfect representation of punks in the 80s. Todays punks have become smart, and have adopted the individuality belief instead of anarchy. This movie I believe gets it point across. It also is very unique. The scene at the punk show is pretty acurate to todays punk shows, but the punks of today don't party. They fight for a cause. Also this film does a great job at exposing posers, skinheads, mobs, metalheads, punks, and new wavers. SLC Punk starts out entertainingly enough as a sarcastic snapshot of the punk-rock scene in Salt Lake City in 1985 and is complete with mohawks, moshing, and vague avowals of anarchy. But gradually, the wanderings of Stevo and Heroin Bob turn into a multilayered exploration of character and culture shock. Though he spends his days drinking and mocking the values of his parents, Stevo turns just as critical an eye on his own rhetoric and lifestyle, and comes to find that aimless rebellion may be just as hollow as the mindless pursuit of money. No character has the right point of view; there are no easy solutions. SLC Punk sustains its energy through wit, realism, propulsive editing, and excellent performances from Lillard, Goorjian, and the rest of the cast. Did I mention plot. Yes the plot is great. It's emblematic of the movie's sophistication that Stevo's lawyer father is treated satirically without being dismissed; though baffled by his son's form of rebellion, he never loses hope that Stevo will go on to law school and continues to cajole Stevo and argue with him about how the world works. By its end, the constantly shifting perspective of SLC Punk achieves a surprising emotional depth. All in all at the end Stevo becomes anything but a poser. Now that he thinks for himself, and has a purpose for his rebellion, he's become a punk all of us punx would be proud of. Forget the critics, and the poseur anarchist out there. This movie is an accurate portrayal of the 80s punx, and thus you must keep in mind that we've changed. Although there are more poseurs out there than there are real punx. It was true in the 80s and is still true today.",0.75,384,0.0433525864130287,0.0,0.11033284740623592,0.10092776958534096,0.07976632565508514,0.3732088876747139,0.1063309202854139,0.13353346212116943,0.11863186223575267,0.07506368864942717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09250824806873584,0.08266206409598748,0.0,0.0,0.053095285563406945,0.0,0.0,0.04101924236436724,0.0,0.08978504383257357,0.04010353373838131,0.0,0.04016598428569347,0.08295169729899426,0.0,0.08500513399260706,0.0703194100219658,0.17492586279147723,0.0,0.05669843865454838,0.21241443033386753,0.05270367829900028,0.0,0.18824392840880272,0.05153107194101211,0.19787800718691392,0.09623159579187598,0.11087392384834482,0.08459778344135215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043505710511491436,0.0,0.16011234130818494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09847703069863012,0.0,0.4314348088411633,0.06619580399905878,0.03534672463742851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870180908454118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057262564268046566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04911467388869097,0.1477325960528341,0.4372531605515969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21054488904436247,0.04157302044717225,0.09293615381203847,0.0,0.09582768325179553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04382000139287051,0.03207873932602648,0.0,0.0,0.05243368653867813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046287635028616866,0.06303389872888664,0.04711593995807556,0.03458125071869734,

The movie is an alright sci-fi summer flick if you don't put to much thinking into it but expect a strong plot or a great male lead or something and be disappointed.",1.0,182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07431314437647706,0.058731967417304166,0.32328683078533066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05526941450260682,0.0,0.0,0.0767539326381165,0.04540923225253694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15637629318450014,0.0,0.0716006246811197,0.06040495876527656,0.0,0.13221750470838606,0.05905648574126629,0.0,0.0,0.06107735743076718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349415180712075,0.0,0.07761146552026577,0.060383539729415195,0.0,0.07588468475544827,0.07284881543219245,0.10628302549003026,0.0,0.06228937110803095,0.05925099529684602,0.0,0.1595972935206148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23578152147769418,0.0,0.21668198647972822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823693936558044,0.09747997721359561,0.0,0.0,0.19437594523345098,0.0,0.06317545150892039,0.0,0.0,0.14053110936207414,0.1389294853019899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04351022036726182,0.6132373748953345,0.07355980329259185,0.0,0.0,0.06200970377752431,0.12244090534645724,0.0,0.0,0.1763948735321182,0.0,0.0,0.06677151424592875,0.0,0.04723916909576923,0.0,0.0793577451000112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658813572872844,0.07275092211282493,0.0,0.06816319668728488,0.04641187689074167,0.0,0.10184873748566253,

250987,6301394577,A6WZ2LI0JT9E4,1,1,1260921600,"Hitchcoock in fine form.  Tense and moving, fine action sequences..","Jamaica Inn of the title is a notorious hovel in Cornwall that in 1815 harbors a ruthless band of cutthroats, who lure ships onto the rocky Cornish coast to shipwreck and plunder them.  Ruthless indeed, as they leave no survivors, killing them in cold blood.  Into this den of horror steps innocent Maureen O'Hara, in her first role, and once she discovers the truth her life is in peril.  Add in a courageous young lawman, the sleazy and quite mad mastermind villain, played to extravagant perfection by Charles Laughton, and you've got a fine and combustible mix of characters.Then put them all in mortal danger, tighten it up so there's never a moment to lose, and you've got classic Hitchcock doing what he was so rightly famous for.  Easily one of the best movies of its era, its star is dimmed today only by the sadly deteriorated print.  Don't let that stop you, though.  The picture and sound are quite adequate, albeit grainy, and once the ship gets sailing, so to speak, you're on board and on the edge of your seat.  The characters are fully developed, to the point you find yourself hoping against hope that one or another will come out all right, and the villains are effortlessly evil enough that you despise them.  No cardboard cartoon cutouts here.A fine, fine movie, with acting and directing way ahead of its time.  Special effects, as in ships getting wrecked, are of the day, but in truth are no less unrealistic than a lot of the ham-handed computer animation that abounds currently.This is a masterful film by the master of suspense, faithfully following a brilliant novel.  Highly recommended.Tom B",1.0,279,0.0,0.0,0.09390478780512006,0.0,0.0,0.308297433768587,0.22624682361729256,0.0852382023134214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654108030010457,0.03936709515496047,0.1582966313716606,0.0,0.0,0.06778445823019044,0.0,0.0,0.052367495365686405,0.0629618456782665,0.03820822940483043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05583007377184579,0.13483012562993263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089865784348829,0.06578749424694383,0.12631115333975068,0.03071368067881067,0.2123219259534914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040881702382339534,0.06712878437313334,0.0,0.0,0.1885820587419066,0.0,0.3365964491478233,0.08450932438868974,0.09025127388752953,0.06238948677084323,0.056170782549864594,0.0,0.05476934728114267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07167492720450638,0.0,0.1516584625161482,0.0,0.0,0.0627025832024506,0.1886038257468667,0.39873016277544626,0.0,0.2686877585849216,0.06891896506054135,0.05375871354892438,0.053074479929840664,0.059323787124410464,0.057365861471705915,0.1529238312721783,0.0,0.0,0.05788691912564588,0.0,0.04095354122025525,0.0,0.06879843035577203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05531482479629912,0.0,0.0,0.05353820122700258,0.059093424771671045,0.04023632823644715,0.0,0.2648903366861039,
656550,B00005JPSE,A2H1WNB30JNAWU,0,0,1344384000,Great Suspense Horror movie,"1408 is a great Suspense Horror movie based on one of King's short stories in one of his short stories collection novals.  I personally enjoy the movie by two great actors.  This movie made me jump in a couple of scenes, I am not sure if you actually like the ending of the movie.  But I do enjoy the ending on the special features.  To me that should have been the ending to the movie not the one they used for actual ending.  But if your a fan of Samuel L Jackson and John Cusack then pick this movie up and watch it.  It will keep you entertained from start to finish if your into King's style of suspense, horor, and trillers.  I have been watching it time and time again and never get tired of the movie.  I will also add I am looking forward to buying the movie ""The Raven"" coming out on DVD in oct.So if you like a good triller with great actors then pick this up and have an evening of suspense and horror.",0.0,179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012617825943588,0.06332618718117265,0.24400281962020046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16190293978952214,0.0,0.0979226022157828,0.06562510308372066,0.0,0.0817093369671183,0.0,0.0809219476893203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04752000667881565,0.06367609046265019,0.07785945545808316,0.06377524897386849,0.19756512539639096,0.0,0.0,0.16747894872741012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745400826644254,0.0,0.2604278050076082,0.1280966997564644,0.08182065001949786,0.03927365219359672,0.11459685521074503,0.0,0.0,0.12777163047098472,0.0,0.0,0.15682925023818708,0.0,0.0,0.40676028185792357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11012753255910064,0.3044573145290773,0.15765780259625298,0.16836979381324688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811725612873434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0628731145438803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04691374187576576,0.36366382011781867,0.0,0.0,0.17143059131444316,0.0,0.06600933045125201,0.11067249664315351,0.14269314033834,0.15215447764214432,0.0,0.08694265804021659,0.14398923092306334,0.0,0.0,0.08084336514362711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469903203349635,0.050042376114012264,0.0,0.1647235525507761,

659244,B00005JPY0,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,1,3,1229817600,Amazing,"There are many people that would gladly shut down this film saying it's surrounded by unjust hype simply because it's the last role of Heath Ledger. I have to say that a statement such as this couldn't be anymore false. Sure, the hype was bigger due to the untimely death of Ledger. But it was a movie and a role (Joker) that delivered on all levels. Batman Begins introduced us to the troubled man that is Bruce Wayne and told the story of how he becomes The Batman. Batman Begins, although very well put together and the story being told brilliantly; I found that at times it had moments when it would drag. The Dark Knight repairs those problems and gives us a movie of equal length, that manages to hold my attention throughout. My review will be split into three sections. The story, the characters and the verdict. This is to give you, the reader a fair and open opinion of the movie for which you can place your own opinion.The Story: A year after the chaos caused by Ra's Al Ghul, the Batman has become a symbol in Gotham for all citizens. It's a symbol to show that nobody needs to be afraid when confronted with the criminal underworld of Gotham. This is a problem for Batman as it's created a lot of copy cat vigilantes. Unfortunately, the copy cat attempts don't go as well as the Batmans attempts do. Batman has inspired even the law to fight against the mob underworld as the new District Attorney in town, Harvey Dent is determined to put the mob behind bars. The fight will be even harder than first thought as a man known only as the Joker, isn't interested in financial gain. He's just interested in creating chaos and he breeds a new class of criminal.The Characters: I'm not going to talk about the Batman character, as simply it's not the most interesting character in this film. Surprisingly. I am, however, going to talk about the ""supporting"" cast in this movie.The Joker (Heath Ledger): This is easily the most intimidating villain in movie history. Even more so than Hannibal Lecter portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. The voice, the look and the body language are all done superbly by Ledger. They blend together brilliantly in order to create a very believable psychopath. The back story of the Joker isn't touched in this film, as in the comic universe it's never been confirmed 100% of how the Joker came about. The Joker, in order to achieve his goal of killing the Batman he must employ the help of the mob. He doesn't have the money but he has the skill of intimidation and the callousness the frighten, even the mob into working for him.Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart): I have to admit, I've never been a fan of Eckhart as most of his movies preceding Dark Knight have been mediocre at best. He wins my vote in his role as Harvey Dent; the fearless District Attorney who, thanks to the work by Batman is willing to put his life on the line to put the mob behind bars. His transformation from respected DA into the broken ""Two-Face"" is inspiring and really seals him as a legitimate actor and a legitimate role.Gordon (Gary Oldman): Oldman plays a much bigger role as Gordon in this movie. He's someone who becomes more involved in shaping the Batman character from hero to vigilante. It's a much more likable role this time around and has bigger impact when confronted with the Harvey Dent alter-ego ""Two-Face""The Verdict: I honestly love this film. Unlike the first installment, this never stops. From the opening we're treated to a great bank robbery that gives us the genius and craziness of Joker. This has its truly heart wrenching moments, but I'm not going to mention them as they give away the plot. I was a little disappointed by the very small and quite frankly, pointless cameo of Scarecrow. Although a beaten shell of a man I would have liked to see him have a darker and more prominent role once again in this picture. Apart from that it's a non-stop genius picture and something that lives up to the hype. The role of Ledger lives up to the bill and is something that could win Heath his first and only Oscar. This makes it more unfortunate that we no longer have Ledger with us to feel the glory created by his Joker.",0.3333333333333333,749,0.06252618251796893,0.02624126307349729,0.05304329241877532,0.0,0.0,0.18997707994050317,0.034079558538538605,0.22469002893733997,0.03802206811289843,0.07217479256025133,0.025633381893516896,0.07353225619827737,0.02505770694421903,0.044473990917606156,0.1390912905178334,0.02111566690359024,0.024740221548657165,0.025525931981331212,0.0,0.09350126611709421,0.07888115710523298,0.07112957005917438,0.05755305510314827,0.07712022365484435,0.0,0.0,0.019939805959433624,0.02359067233962163,0.10216704013052126,0.11832292836349176,0.1681936777629193,0.0,0.08177451951823433,0.14296762396564544,0.050675328069180806,0.0,0.19392769842827645,0.07432177584131391,0.09513124373391971,0.13879204957123314,0.026651709361995426,0.020335489704792344,0.0,0.024020569509796842,0.026051708835464097,0.0,0.10457838163330128,0.07509718953354541,0.0923701610846106,0.025279021602253753,0.04715983082282621,0.061568517109525406,0.023671762574238253,0.050017164290824034,0.2189383921252558,0.031824098362021956,0.0,0.04698864126801869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026796645539145274,0.0,0.022939458825801614,0.022678019281579025,0.0,0.0,0.027529380529222505,0.019036928226399193,0.0,0.11140485898178942,0.0472244498420038,0.17045636311796797,0.6406477176801108,0.0,0.02529527279898045,0.0,0.02024418725592958,0.03997304396925133,0.16754891105018346,0.02160254896490481,0.276418996375044,0.0,0.05264956740034987,0.0435975324960831,0.06320032163536282,0.046266238672271934,0.0,0.0,0.05041572719364646,0.043967204061022114,0.0,0.0,0.0645244753168131,0.023750851892109712,0.040322295659054694,0.04450621220997698,0.045455985246096765,0.06795395857717375,0.03325035902182606,

I can only hope that when historians sift the immeasurable tonnage of creative discharge that is the output of the early 21st century entertainment bidness they see this chunk of chaff for what it is: a wholly shallow and derivative kluge whose target market can only be the LA-Auckland route. An in-flight soporific produced to help you gulp down the microwaved "" 'chicken'/ 'kiev' "" with the ""hardicourt(sic) vert"" meant to somehow sustain you during the next 10 hours of the flight. Of course, you're in coach and, of course, the folks with the infant across the isle find it completely possible to sleep through lil' Hermione's endless wet screams, while the pair beside you begin to lose their struggle against claustrophobia just as the folks ahead lean all the way back at the very moment that the young couple directly behind you start the interminable family debt argument so yeah! baby, yeah!

146522,0792841344,A1D2Z6UOCT9456,3,3,1068336000,Don Coscarelli's horror rollercoaster with BALLS !,"Gruesome, quirky and highly inventive low budget horror film from the late 1970's has definitely achieved cult status amongst terror aficionado's , spawning multiple sequels over the past quarter century, and a legion of loyal fans to the battle between good &amp; evil at Morningside Funeral Home. Young director Don Coscarelli's horror cheapie was a surprise hit globally in 1979, and like other inventive low budget horror films ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", it has become a pillar outlining the trends of modern horror movies of the past 25 years.( Interestingly, Coscarelli's celluloid life has been virtually consumed by ""Phantasm"", in much the same way as George Romero's onscreen output has been dominated by the ""Living Dead"" since 1968. Coscarelli has directed all the subsequent sequels to the original ""Phantasm"" !! )Innovative, and often humorous plot has two orphaned brothers ( Mike &amp; Jody ) , and their ice cream selling buddy ( Reggie ) investigating unusual phenomenon at the nearby Morningside Cemetery. Mike witnesses all manner of strange happenings including malignant, grunting dwarfs ( looking suspiciously like Jawa's from ""Star Wars"" ), a stunning lady in lavender wooing amorous males to their death, and a deadly chrome sphere that drills the brains out of those unfortunate enough to forget to duck !!The gatekeeper ( literally ) to all this evil, is the Tall Man....a malevolent alien robbing the graveyard's of recently deceased to supply bodies for his nefarious purposes.This DVD package is excellent value with a wonderful introduction by the Tall Man ( Angus Scrimm ) to a top quality print of the feature film. In addition, there is an insightful audio commentary with the director and all key cast members, deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage with commentary, TV &amp; theatre trailers, TV interviews, a booklet.....and much, much more !!When ""Phantasm"" was released in Australia in 1979 the distributors changed the film's name to ""The Never Dead"". And the reason why ??? Well, in 1977 a soft porn film with plenty of onscreen nudity was made &amp; released in Australia with the title ""Fantasm"" ! And the distributors of ""Phantasm"" in Australia obviously did not want horror fans accidently walking into the wrong theatre.....Arguably, ""Phantasm"" hasn't aged brilliantly since it's initial release in 1979, and it looks quite hokey in some places by current horror standards. However, the film's raw unpolished style and it's effective combination of a truly eerie soundtrack, believable heroes, a dominating onscreen villain and scarey jolts combined with injections of humor still make it an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes. Fans of modern horror should have this imaginative film in their inventory !!",1.0,445,0.0,0.0,0.14250100048077669,0.0,0.07726697994573804,0.29771823963377364,0.0,0.03233735305928439,0.07660981953655696,0.0,0.0,0.09877233857521966,0.0,0.0,0.16014397043674783,0.0,0.0,0.051431632724071225,0.04936815863706159,0.0,0.2384038340335572,0.0,0.028990592727213955,0.07769391185236814,0.0,0.03890744968902372,0.0,0.0,0.24702491670077922,0.03405803388423334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04115175518993208,0.0,0.0,0.3125924857241557,0.04991643114496067,0.07187918533031604,0.11652042263970125,0.0,0.0,0.0779498059861956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04214253112462618,0.0,0.0,0.05093413849186216,0.1425319416338763,0.0,0.0,0.033592824029391025,0.3018285931751858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048812717114239665,0.04155638368215552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0429576210505898,0.0,0.0,0.028620727964591784,0.5647367425637796,0.14516141964316007,0.0,0.0,0.04078956272804398,0.0,0.06751811501145988,0.0,0.23206270375545981,0.0,0.053041221288148435,0.0,0.0,0.0932208154694148,0.0,0.104401973385536,0.0,0.04429427087764362,0.0,0.0,0.04333631015751406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831765077175549,0.0,0.0,

497794,B00000F3KL,A2KN89AD9G1NNX,2,3,1027209600,Postmodern War Still Sucks,"Blackhawk Down is a truly jarring film, more jarring than other contenders in the field, Saving Private Ryan, and Enemy at the Gates.  I kept thinking as I watched this movie how all our good intentions and high technology could not prevent this disaster from happening.  This film shook me in that regard; Ridley Scott depicts a fast, hopeless battle against a foe armed less with high-tech weapons than hate and courage.Mark Bowden's excellent book makes a good transition, but the necessary filmic needs of recognizable characters leaves us with little to hang on to; too many faces look alike, talk alike. Die alike. Some reviewers have called this war pornography, but there is too much pain, at least for me, to enjoy the violence.  This is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If this were War Porn, Ridley Scott would have shown the massive numbers of Somali dead and hideously wounded our forces caused.  The kill ratio was at least 10 to 1 or higher.This film also made me ask questions so I ended up reading the book, thus learning more than I intended. For me, at least, this makes Blackhawk Down worth seeing.By the way, this is a landmark historical film: For the first time actual videotapes of a battle in progress were availible for the filmmakers to use, creating a record of words and wounds, unlike say Saving Private Ryan, which is an unlikely concoction of wishful thinking and cgi.",0.6666666666666666,242,0.0,0.0,0.05943541710763948,0.08155346604481942,0.06445421668940587,0.2128707791743044,0.0,0.05395005117861875,0.2556241184740591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09966689773931352,0.06679408318586225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26516082961829507,0.079701230304054,0.19346592263928444,0.06481035279878768,0.0,0.12982255524155847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11364150106713662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08517314226309593,0.06626670151435086,0.13037848654427756,0.0,0.19986616922225137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757342033624475,0.31924570001885233,0.14061705711051353,0.0,0.05175073795400761,0.0,0.07926442971010539,0.0,0.0,0.11208923453304348,0.19367538332907458,0.05348872045747512,0.0,0.0,0.07110465756106397,0.08143673916825356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399307346825259,0.07166838454409713,0.0,0.23811911661617682,0.047749416460532705,0.3364925132058565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805130255086347,0.0,0.3379317181904873,0.07261746677678992,0.19358100709886544,0.17265319318715736,0.0,0.07327705570133591,0.0,0.051841676262816945,0.0,0.08708956167458043,0.0,0.0,0.16458682878686284,0.0,0.0,0.07983903663395003,0.0,0.0,0.1018675621343659,0.07614293321505754,0.0,

She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the ""outlaw"" value.

387319,6303890458,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,2,4,1055808000,The Gestation Period Seemed More Like Nine Years,"The term ""uneven"" comedy could have been coined to describe ""Nine Months."" The first two-thirds of the movie (with the exception of Robin Williams' scene in which he plays an unbelievably inept Russian OB/GYN doctor) is the typical romantic comedy stuff you'll find on any average or below-average sitcom. Hugh Grant fusses and frets about being a father and showing commitment when his lover Julianne Moore gets pregnant.  She dumps him, and he tries to win her back, the result of which is a foregone conclusion.  The last one-third of the movie, however, is energetic and is played for all-out farce as Hugh drives Julianne to the hospital for her delivery, creating havoc (and presumably enough lawsuits to bankrupt him into the 22nd Century, not that this is ever mentioned) along the way, but do the laughs generated excuse the first two-thirds of the film?  I imagine certain women who enjoy sitcoms and pregnancy might find this movie heart-warming and ""real"", but the rest of us will be stuck with not overly convincing characterizations, despite an overall talented cast.  Joan Cusack, as usual, rises above the material, and Robin Williams in a manic world all his own as the nutty doctor generates laughs.  Jeff Goldblum gives an impeccable performance in what is generally a thankless role as Hugh's best friend.  And between you and me, Tom Arnold (and NOT between you and I), please buy an English grammar book and learn the difference between objective and subjective case pronouns.  (I don't entirely blame the screenwriter/director Columbus, who might buy one as well, since I've seen Mr. Arnold butcher English on talk shows.)  As for Arnold's performance, he does the best he can do with a weak script that calls for him to be callous and obnoxious one moment and incredibly sensitive the next.  Julianne Moore, one of our best actresses, tries heroically to bring emotional truth to her stereotypical role, and Hugh Grant relies on his stuttering boyish charm to breeze through the mishmash, but his tearful moments are less convincing, but how much can the poor guy do when he's working with a cardboard cutout?",0.5,356,0.04516510326876007,0.0,0.07663048288996507,0.0,0.16620250986911198,0.3888122796655521,0.03692549389940388,0.20867449115072312,0.0,0.07820200661814633,0.0,0.053115220073218075,0.16290144202228635,0.1285012013641052,0.0,0.09151602460444326,0.16083745313163583,0.05531513235932092,0.0,0.0,0.04273420505393822,0.10275933210097635,0.12471845741194795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036629687848172915,0.22779911508865833,0.16504106781932976,0.17720678618431013,0.1770361674000752,0.05490715249004124,0.0,0.08404892964961311,0.053685520941981535,0.15461327746516298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051450703434714216,0.0,0.0,0.1000838615840534,0.0,0.051098081079188264,0.0,0.0,0.10838805278523443,0.17479488172968355,0.10344505037458115,0.1472981061154966,0.0,0.045837856532259316,0.0,0.04469422302973695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058489928055456906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061563643685010064,0.49891836863015243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04841084848239442,0.0,0.19966823519312177,0.0,0.11409251546785089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05614257870616251,0.0,0.047638842606871894,0.0,0.04513935694004198,0.09321709638066959,0.10293700672864997,0.08737910619849429,0.048222862558112,0.13133853276477844,0.0,0.10808114733866005,

589718,B00005JKN9,AFLTHO3MB4825,1,3,1056412800,"Day-Lewis brilliantly on-track, Scorsese not...","THE GANGS OF NEW YORK features camera-shy performer Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting in what is probably his best role to date. Day-Lewis, who doesn't make many movies, is smart enough to be selective in this era of empty-headed movies. My hat is off to him. A brutal performance. A performance nightmares are made of. A great performance. Unfortunately, Day-Lewis is almost the only saving grace in Martin Scorsese's 3-hour blood-bath. Spending north of $100 million, Scorsese took several years to complete this drama about the New York draft riots in 1863. The costumes, the look of the town, even the violence is very effective. But as the film proceeds the violence piles up. The streets are running red with blood. While 'the butcher' is always a fascinating character to watch, nobody else is as watchable. Leonardo DiCaprio, who seeks the death of 'the butcher' for murdering his father (nicely played by Liam Neeson in a cameo), is sadly miscast here. Or maybe anybody would be when compared to the monumental acting talents of Day-Lewis. No fault of DiCaprio. Cameron Diaz is terribly wasted. Scorsese has made a 'man's film', and it would seem there is little use for women, including Diaz. It is always good to see Henry Thomas' career be given a boost with a large role. He plays Jonny, DiCaprio's friend, and a loyal follower of Cutting's. A strong performance, and this young man is still learning his craft. He'll only get better. But all of these actor's abilities pale in comparison to Day-Lewis. Again, no fault of Scorsese here. His primary fault is losing himself in the violence, in the blood, in the tragic events that unfold throughout the film. Three hours of grisly death is hard to stomach. And with so little humor in the film, it's not a wonder why there are people who either love the film or hate it. As for me, I appreciated the scope of the film. I understood what Scorsese was trying to do. But somewhere in the making of the epic, the director lost his way, his focus. Day-Lewis displays an actor's clinic with his performance. This is the main reason why you should see the movie. There are some other fine moments as well. Afterall, Scorsese is Scorsese. The film in a lesser director's hands would have churned out a piece of cheese. Still, even great directors sometimes lose their way. For Scorsese, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK was one time he did.",0.3333333333333333,418,0.037032683597679604,0.0,0.031416206555696706,0.0,0.03406902960288537,0.07501242742298024,0.12110678672669077,0.14258383586745638,0.0,0.0961814528761388,0.0,0.0,0.04452314673210529,0.0790224751129402,0.035305829691834,0.0,0.043959030914031104,0.0,0.0,0.08306766856672482,0.24527644708361385,0.0,0.10226167633545509,0.0,0.04188782257294351,0.03431062159175893,0.0708590701070824,0.0,0.03630657928151342,0.030034153410237453,0.11206899055729247,0.0,0.04843298896107657,0.25402837194691574,0.0,0.0,0.2756603831870928,0.0,0.338063042480441,0.08220303640267564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04268033556518838,0.046289313610599514,0.04218649982571217,0.0,0.0,0.027354260339898646,0.08983276806187275,0.0,0.03646548248871794,0.08412113373714103,0.02962390705850202,0.3275916559394549,0.0,0.030193909476155474,0.08349056737615454,0.07516860207996565,0.04304560384086888,0.03664658996250343,0.04761293537048205,0.0,0.0,0.08058971894874038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03382527980869659,0.037882274272136904,0.0,0.0,0.02523925301510612,0.5335868147526761,0.04267030760524739,0.0,0.0,0.1079111015634149,0.0,0.07938800112447693,0.038383937504458794,0.2046450147145028,0.0,0.0,0.03873258117356705,0.03743195922318405,0.05480465651369598,0.04349314435109341,0.09206711390478435,0.0,0.039061001913842805,0.0,0.07402314629576134,0.0382162221086682,0.0,0.10746846211027336,0.0,0.1076897422135584,0.12074225608488566,0.02954002568789485,

Even worse are how the characters look. The Hobbits in here made me burst with excruciating laughter because they looked more like giant oranges with chipmunk teeth. Gandalf and his nemesis Saruman both looked like scrapped Santa Claus cartoon shots and what's up with renaming Saruman, Auruman? Was it to avoid the confusion with the name Sauron? Beats me. Boromir looks like some crazed viking drunk than an actual warrior.So much else completel fails on this animated movie. I really love the books so much because of their rich detail, incredible characters, and imaginative scope of the various languages, races of beings, and much, much more but none of the greatness of the books is present on this animated movie and everything that is great about the books gets badly soiled and reduced to complete dust.Ralph Bakshi really drops the ball on this one and his directing is really sloppy and the movie is literrally cut off at the end where it starts with Bilbo's 111th birthday as usual but ending suddenly with the Battle of Helm's Deep and never going any further. No wonder this movie flopped. It's really bad and is unworthy of one's time.Unless one's a Tolkien completist or extreme zealot, this animated version of LOTR is just a waste of time. I'm not saying that this deserves to necessarily be thrown in a magnesium fire necessarily but this movie could really have been a great animated movie but they completely blew their chance at it.",0.6153846153846154,307,0.04932496807957146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045377586348335545,0.27475622555785123,0.04032646171696685,0.03798235758029597,0.08998329437987228,0.0427023431923219,0.12132828451241169,0.058007318594199685,0.0,0.17542076727230632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2212807554003379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437937064325937,0.0,0.0,0.040003410888368306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09667091043693421,0.0599642942870171,0.0,0.12238684211332487,0.05863014617814471,0.2251382719165859,0.16423312136876372,0.0,0.048126113262219945,0.13733579548955957,0.05684724910160774,0.0,0.1123789882417531,0.0989983740215085,0.0,0.21860387425830452,0.0,0.2232175760263691,0.0,0.05602176014948358,0.03945699117912048,0.2727058641613004,0.150630270966896,0.12064858468983515,0.0,0.05005968428402837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714434246853641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09010585703008965,0.05045656397884714,0.0,0.05588085791970624,0.13446774345031173,0.4027303729428583,0.11366778510786618,0.0,0.061420928737283526,0.0,0.09460048759221813,0.21147863135747283,0.10224948927516155,0.10902919084231594,0.0,0.0,0.05158911384281403,0.0,0.10949400653154306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04929685042345477,0.05090135935355177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21515291012479612,0.0,0.0,

Bear in mind, please, that DOMAs have thus far been used exclusively to defraud married transsexuals of their rights, and that's what I'm seeing here--that Melanie Carmichael, regardless of her decisions, efforts and beliefs, was still Melanie Smooter; and that her new marriage in her new life couldn't really happen because of this.Reese Witherspoon is a superb actress who probably could have and really should have rejected this part, which is not only demeaning to Alabama, but to women and marriage as well.",0.2,160,0.06606657187708201,0.08318132771782766,0.0,0.0,0.0607793919958448,0.23418973543060154,0.0,0.10174823237965513,0.0,0.05719613282433713,0.16250884980870614,0.07769583706811768,0.0,0.046992219887633795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409665682949612,0.0,0.0,0.04560889013124722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607434322017989,0.0,0.40236439125993756,0.08640479802061599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294502281651525,0.0,0.1507767202186944,0.0366627009266488,0.0,0.12892161697393512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07526101681576639,0.06629992321997125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05284926164743708,0.18263307891907354,0.0,0.0,0.07447388407683057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.498039465045043,0.2908601825932326,0.0,0.0,0.17111569580464217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270162045218486,0.09519226862546294,0.07612413334787096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07081438033830145,0.0,0.25556171690291835,0.0,0.0,0.06909920128631235,0.0,0.048885949207685235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06968510623122734,0.0,0.1320578213679092,0.0,0.07528705418187268,0.12781633567548994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

It was campy, filled with funny lines and situations.  I just recently watched it again after nearly 30 years and found it still amusing.  George Hamilton's dual performance still holds up incredibly well, and Brenda Vacarro is quite good.  Now being 30 years older than when I first saw it, I found Rob Liebman's continual screaming of his lines to be beyond annoying.  Rather than a bumbling villain, he is a really bad ham actor playing a really bad ham buffoon.Still a funny film after 30 years, but it was interesting to watch it again with older eyes and even older perceptions.",0.0,116,0.0,0.30770143434578484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093951468870843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10578895884411701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691598138207175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370478700701051,0.23123739429152193,0.27801851191773974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11321366522174243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232634928590101,0.0,0.0,0.11974418967569643,0.0,0.0,0.07579898218393284,0.0,0.1394369816824348,0.474674796624567,0.15625713547941697,0.11922557486587122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06755898455121877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2689849327772664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27687369529195704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0654885146709833,0.0,0.1350521273607654,0.0,0.0,0.12780466440781216,0.0,0.18083717948801178,0.14351294309364268,0.0,0.0,0.12888834386380857,0.0,0.0,0.12610085084817346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17767020615140838,0.0,0.0,

1377836,B003ZSJ212,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6,19,1294617600,In a galaxy far far away,"Star Wars -- the modern American epic, a groundbreaking sci-fantasy story, and a pop culture tornado.So whether you love it, hate it, or experience both emotions for different parts of the story, it's undeniable that ""Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" inspires passionate emotion in almost everybody. The original trilogy is absolutely brilliant, the prequel trilogy much less so, but it's definitely one of those things you HAVE to watch one way or another.All six movies form a multigenerational epic -- the prequel trilogy follows the sinister Darth Sidious and his Sith minions infiltrating and slowly conquering the Galactic Republic. In the meantime, the Jedi find a child, Anakin Skywalker, who is said to be the Chosen One (groan, another overused fantasy trope).Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is entrusted with the boy's training, but he cannot stop Anakin's increasingly dark, angry feelings from swaying him. As Darth Sidious manipulates wars, planets and the Jedi Order itself, Anakin becomes his greatest pawn.Then we get to the original trilogy, which takes place about twenty years later. The Republic has turned into the brutal, cruel Empire, but there is a Rebellion fighting against it from the shadows. Young farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) ends up on the run with the mysterious hermit Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a pair of quirky droids, scruffy pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).As he helps the Rebellion fight the Empire, Luke learns that he has the potential to be a Jedi, and he turns out to be more powerful than anyone expected. However, the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) has a particular interest in Luke -- and soon reveals the shocking connection between them, which will change Luke's life forever.The Star Wars Saga is more than just a series of movies: it's been homaged, spoofed, quoted ripped-off, studied, dissected, analyzed, spun off and even had a tiny religion named after it. It is a pop culture juggernaut, and it is impossible to escape all the stuff connected to it -- honestly, who has never heard ""Luke, I am your father"" (even if that never was actually said)?So how good is it? Well, the original trilogy is absolutely brilliant -- a seamless blend of groundbreaking special effects, classic storytelling and solid acting. Things do get a bit goofy with the introduction of the living teddy bears, but you cannot deny the raw, gritty power of the last scenes of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" or the exultant golden joy of ""A New Hope's"" finale.The prequel trilogy is... not nearly as bad as people say. Yes, it's overloaded with special effects, the stories are flabbier, and Jar Jar Binks makes me want to stab myself in the head with a barbeque fork. But it still has some solid content, such as the Greek tragedy that Anakin's life turns into, or the death of Obi-Wan's mentor Qui-Gon Jinn.Similarly, the acting is a mixed bag. The original trio of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are absolutely brilliant, and there's a real chemistry there that makes you believe that these three are fast friends... and in Han and Leia's case, a bit more (""I love you!"" ""I know""). And you've got the other classic characters: Chewie, the droids, and the hulking deep-voiced Vader.The prequel trilogy has great performances by Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and the glorious Ian McDermid... buuuuuutt, we're also treated to very wooden performances by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenson. Especially in their romantic scenes, (""I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life"").Despite its flaws, ""Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" is a movie series that everybody should definitely watch -- it still has plenty of power, imagination and fun.",0.3157894736842105,628,0.029687848101407354,0.03737857969616999,0.05037061738655103,0.034557664727507015,0.0,0.30067461154649044,0.07281540667127374,0.11430463173925301,0.0,0.07710541299627537,0.0,0.06982721044710728,0.0,0.10558273619581848,0.05660697563116925,0.0,0.03524046614171373,0.0,0.0,0.06659253629411555,0.0,0.0,0.02049493054989201,0.05492579412041371,0.06716009713766291,0.027505663190577703,0.02840265821402486,0.03360302526837404,0.20374028405577596,0.024077363498263036,0.1197892184351959,0.0,0.038827086770014,0.05818455473192862,0.036091475161812596,0.028080013819059373,0.1104937961361641,0.10586542323304378,0.20326026793439997,0.23064786490993117,0.03796322759450685,0.028966278050804265,0.0,0.06843075878280665,0.0,0.033819488005839934,0.08937812241952872,0.0,0.021928983994779855,0.072015887417809,0.03358770288479814,0.02923314218409547,0.0,0.04749696578716877,0.1969643510002422,0.022665440942227014,0.07261630357557296,0.0,0.12052024448398226,0.034508202595967014,0.02937832991151445,0.03816967758257642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032584550484967,0.0,0.0,0.08134974336651422,0.030368936168523316,0.06347492326612951,0.06726745039227519,0.14163417982127696,0.6558963301713074,0.03420734031557697,0.03603109223839051,0.03696819833027009,0.08650867505240525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16405697673865333,0.0,0.0,0.03105059841054399,0.030007933846457523,0.021967518415683465,0.06973396132862214,0.03690354340012599,0.07181316964697948,0.03131388219404137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06766237644999419,0.057435883997013534,0.03169776918523087,0.10791402344914587,0.0,0.16576866627947817,

The people who complain about the film involving aliens are not seeing the point of the movie. George lucas in creating the story is not focusing on the aliens, but in the beliefs and religion of the group of people involved. On top of that you naysayers talk as if Indiana was in the jungle fighting aliens with a blaster which was not the case. People need to learn how too just watch a movie and have fun instead of always looking for a masterpiece. In the end Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a fun adventure film worthy of both Indy and George Lucas.",0.4444444444444444,128,0.08519268216142854,0.0,0.07227212936804173,0.0,0.0,0.17256405063778849,0.06965071787185678,0.06560204786873516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0605963521218496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418222002228638,0.0,0.05881255179875203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909275366763502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10356862382530298,0.08057881744087217,0.21138307325574676,0.0,0.09721310519056708,0.04727646279323575,0.0,0.08312205421398494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887831974761861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20444697925478952,0.37680785068645045,0.13008216019188268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3285967914605255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09107428306290899,0.0,0.058062215621946994,0.5728342507035499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04565748475525326,0.0,0.04707802946148332,0.1049711983280074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25215324571455655,0.10005479654561136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708247144591839,0.0824094254542197,0.0,0.061934331306607665,0.0,0.06795602627153235,

A documentary that blends real-life forensics with the fictional forensics of Sherlock Holmes,"XXXXX""Sherlock Holmes, the first CSI, continues to inspire detectives on TV and at the movies.  He is as popular as ever.  But his lasting legacy is that, even today, he continues to solve crimes.""The above is said by the narrator at the end of this spectacularly interesting documentary that blends real-life forensic analysis with Sherlockian forensic analysis.I learned quite a bit from this documentary, not only about forensics but about Sherlock Holmes (and his alter ego, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1859 to 1930).Using a combination of interviews (with forensic scientists, crime historians, Sherlock Holmes' experts, etc.), dramatic recreations, and archival footage (some in black and white), this documentary explains the impact and legacy of the most famous fictional crime fighter in history.Here are some of the chapters found in this documentary:(1) Jack the Ripper(2) Deductive reasoning(3) Blood evidence(4) Bullets and ballistics(5) The science of poisoning(6) Fingerprints and fakes(7) The art of tracing footstepsFinally, what I especially liked about this documentary is the use of real high-profile murder cases with footage of the real crime scenes.In conclusion, not only is this an instructional documentary on forensics, it is an entertaining one as well.  I leave you with this piece of wisdom from Sherlock Holmes:""Once you've excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""(2013;  2 hr;  2 episodes;  wide screen;  12 chapters)&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",0.0,227,0.21416145284694674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13134835084427487,0.25304987861321077,0.058363772383661264,0.16491357619990774,0.1302312250546206,0.061802343479023136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015533453374165,0.06805832979784202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006392757510519,0.0,0.08120977725277306,0.0,0.1320741046125475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440220757881161,0.0,0.0,0.13991009309127408,0.0,0.0,0.1771283046350648,0.0,0.24437896912231455,0.03961528032841631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857396723929993,0.0,0.08658439992449861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11421080620883826,0.3552141218284207,0.10900225899439979,0.05820418517142714,0.16094306858364343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1460497792239518,0.0,0.0,0.09730638937232355,0.5142922249836984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678106113619778,0.0,0.11834700975299783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07529709891228892,0.0,0.07134645676427855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20759132572120625,0.0,0.11388741338479152,

It starred Roger Moore as the title character, who was always helping people in need that were additionally difficult for the police to help.  A vigilante therefore, and the police generally considered him at best a nuisance.  Not as spectacular, understandably, as the his James Bond movies which followed; more down to earth and realistic, as a general rule. But it was always quite stylishly done; and one sees that here in ""Vendetta for the Saint.""  I actually like him here, in this character, more so than as Bond; but I would credit the movies as being more exciting.  [Actually, I am looking forward to a ""Best of the Saint""; perhaps a 3 DVD collection (one episode per year, say).]  In the mean time, why not give this movie length version a try - the Saint as his best!

1062970,B000O78628,A36KA4FVV10HDC,6,6,1231718400,Superb...breathes new life into old classics,"I held off buying this one for a long time.  Mistake!  This DVD is phenomenal.  The band is phemonenal.  Ditto the arrangements.  I actually had the DVD on my table for over a week...from the moment I put it on, I was in rapture!  Greg indeed has not been in this fine form in years.  He sounded tired and raspy during the ELP tours of the 90's...not on this performance.  These renditions of classic ELP and King Crimson material  are stunning.  The audio is superb, as is the camerawork.  Greg's voice is better than I've heard it since the eighties.And no, I'm not just one more rabid ELP fan gazing through rose-colored glasses...I don't award a five-star rating to much of anything!  I can't wait to burn the audio of this show to a CD-R.  Greg also displays a humble outlook as he shares between songs.  Very refreshing on a concert DVD.  The arrangement of Take a Pebble includes an astonishing guitar solo from one of his band members.  If there's an ""uninteresting"" track on this disc, it would have to be Pictures at an Exhibition, simply because the arrangement is virtually identical to the studio version ELP did back in the early 90's.  It's still a strong performance, too; I had merely gotten ""spoiled"" by the fresh twists in the other classic material.Having also seen footage of Keith Emerson's band from 2006, I'd say he and Greg Lake are performing better with the ""fresh blood"" of new musicians inspiring them.  Stop pining away, waiting for an ELP reunion that probably won't happen  ( and ask youself if you truly want to see the musical equivalent of Kirk, Spock and McCoy ""on deck"" in their sixties! )...this is about as good as it gets.",1.0,294,0.05665341261614945,0.0,0.0,0.13189299757736223,0.20847819860886485,0.1721334881493442,0.09263591093723934,0.1745023066337753,0.05167626968191276,0.04904683292745988,0.0696773017004551,0.06662574114132473,0.0,0.0,0.05401163358877671,0.05739713548370623,0.0,0.06938522865366985,0.19980433016508065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11733161861542768,0.15722259492896495,0.0,0.05248914238222479,0.0,0.12824951469553258,0.0555426022878181,0.045946907445657804,0.17144560282192103,0.0,0.0,0.055516883134392944,0.0,0.10717035493609495,0.21085565389059158,0.0,0.22626461652749247,0.15719501286401982,0.0,0.05527643825045487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056853516080543405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06409551759566222,0.05578569590375986,0.06434517885772602,0.13595791070293398,0.2819007614607094,0.25951518751527486,0.13857391735076552,0.0,0.0,0.06585211004964424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06164396091063441,0.0,0.0,0.07483105275493937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06418334211514093,0.03861156352378944,0.48977569615745137,0.06527797362677684,0.06875824507790143,0.0,0.05502825764354829,0.0,0.21253663813137064,0.05872059051666601,0.18784226254429723,0.06980619063524199,0.0,0.0,0.05726423323625412,0.04192068353036271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041186533134029805,0.061571384964482376,0.04519098000483071,

1682426,B00GUO2SKA,AZ4IUCJHXTUBD,1,2,1391299200,Dallas Buyers morally-questionable Club,"Dallas Buyers morally-questionable ClubDallas Buyers Club is a biographical drama film starring Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner. The film is based on the true-life tale of Ron Woodroof, an AIDS-infected person who began smuggling unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he found them effective at improving his symptoms.McConaughey's portrayal is realistic as morally-questionable fighter. His HIV diagnosis doesn't automatically cause Ron to become a pious individual. He realizes that he could make money by importing drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that the drugs are for his personal use. He partners in his business with Rayon (Jared Leto), an HIV-positive transgender woman, since she can bring many more clients.The pair establish the &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34;, charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. The film is enlightening in depicting that there were many AIDS-medication buyers clubs across the country. But if the long lines of people seeking the non-approved drugs (as depicted in the film) were true it seems that would have caused much unwanted attention.Jared Leto gives a layered performance as Rayon. Rayon becomes the moral core of the film. She is there to show Ron's evolution against his homophobic prejudice. He is almost unrecognizable but his muscular body looks extremely well for someone who is depicted as an emaciated dying AIDS-infected drug addicted.The characters of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) were fictional; the writers interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists and doctors for the film and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles.While Woodroof was known for outlandish behavior, according to those who knew him both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was. Actually McConaughey's disposition as the confrontational brash character is as he has often been in film roles.A major point is never made of Ron nor Rayon never expressing having any conscious regarding refusing to serve others who may not be able to afford the $400 Buyers Club fee.",0.5,344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252213410004802,0.18380636535283565,0.037094184011459225,0.24456576424006674,0.04138544193526314,0.03927963199979977,0.0,0.05335787119253431,0.0,0.06454412257936845,0.08651148155531063,0.0459670528161744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34343545306074963,0.0,0.1566102751891297,0.0,0.051319819156515706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04448183191366197,0.036797026602381426,0.3661436650035518,0.0,0.11867755743873257,0.2667674068806932,0.0,0.042914209255914014,0.11257719741930643,0.05393077741893277,0.2588660190766894,0.050356460460023164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11342481215099717,0.0,0.04553168994298404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05133151711789214,0.0,0.0,0.03629440394769415,0.12542386655692114,0.03463920928742882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05273830122703304,0.0,0.05833407139912601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11751426588994959,0.05992917460580769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051401852236385624,0.12368978102169892,0.4358240200513771,0.0,0.1651971229787549,0.0,0.08813982803030657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20058039785939183,0.0,0.0573068673722336,0.0,0.0,0.06714517223520114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047856475489980586,0.15987924817256344,0.0,0.04682147428519987,0.0,0.1755565763271272,0.0,0.03298463465000808,0.04931004101120716,0.0,

I had heard about it from reading Roman's autobiography so Id thought I should watch it and see what jumpstarted his career in the film industry. The whole movie is in polish, so if you don't like reading subtitles or havent had a language course in polish, then this film might not be for you. The film takes place mostly on a boat throughout the whole movie, so it's a little clausterphobic at times. The film has a really slow settle pace to it, and there is really no action to the film except for a few knife brandishings and a couple of verbal fights, but thats about it. If your into Polanski like I am, you might take pleasure into watching this film, otherwise I would say skip it.",0.0,142,0.1675769294913356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12728977864996993,0.0,0.0,0.07642744012205026,0.07253859285535207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059597552097924576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261838636814766,0.0,0.0,0.5549513279317337,0.09531746915086153,0.11568630774307491,0.07750895161828733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18967665749498844,0.08214561416109448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08210757641048883,0.0,0.15850129924536951,0.1559241597866285,0.19919039493977544,0.09561075705589854,0.27898327430599723,0.0,0.0,0.1555284731271968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12378100939339039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516432464189127,0.06702570408253541,0.04632462335982623,0.06396901832850516,0.0,0.0,0.0850365292694177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18444068961587506,0.09116931543982014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295946166543199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24145384926659283,0.0,0.0,0.10433590780733797,0.08138491597711184,0.0,0.1347147591107344,0.0,0.13890614939277998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840560926478929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1674814024051563,0.08646628512402466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091061978091111,0.20050775373119745,
1125473,B0010HOZVW,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,0,0,1228694400,The Brave One - You can never be the person you were,"The Brave One was an excellent film which deserves a five star rating. Besides the very excellent action story featuring an abundance of action and violence, this story has a lot to say about never being able to return to who you were prior to being made the victim of a violent crime.The story makes a convincing case for the idea that extreme trauma almost always prevents one from returning to that innocent ""person"", or possessing that tranquil state of mind he or she believed they were in prior to being a victim of violence.  That person is dead and gone, always replaced by a new person having no ""illusions"" or ideals about safety, truth or justice.The question is how to proceed from that point on. The idea that revenge and violence is inescapable is troubling, but I don't believe it to be necessarily true as Jodie Foster's character emphatically did. Nevertheless, this story was a chilling and exciting roller coaster of a film and I recommend it for all fans of action movies as well as wonderful Jodie Foster.",0.0,180,0.1588554263338997,0.0,0.06738149117704986,0.0,0.14614253401521551,0.20110835181555808,0.0,0.18348831762600196,0.0,0.06876333829886719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05649581106247749,0.07572395628546569,0.0,0.0,0.0972776358039893,0.0,0.0,0.15030543210512662,0.0,0.10966544018501709,0.14695003174232593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787036436716303,0.0,0.080121870486066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656015913085501,0.0,0.04926970745882744,0.0,0.18126943392893433,0.08815455109568626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633667670601438,0.0,0.0,0.09021151902384573,0.0,0.2634820132790299,0.06063976532796621,0.12951981591802303,0.0,0.3224432898264062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10286085700058015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3396452300116212,0.0,0.32479895394200387,0.267035345071493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07616731126725529,0.08513570675455376,0.0,0.3511381612281155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08028407967286273,0.1175450471014692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377805102465716,0.1865908660433235,0.0,0.0,0.09051292317494637,0.07683279879400783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335745777358294,
1244856,B001WAKOX0,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,1,2,1248739200,Some are not going to agree.....,"I know there are those who won't agree, but I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I have some of the other Perry movies. First, ""Madea goes to Jail"" was typical Tyler Perry, there was nothing new or exciting. The cookie cutter formula of ""man does woman wrong, woman struggles, Madea acts a fool but has a good heart, and everything works out after a great deal of struggle, with a lot of laughs and some serious moments"" is still the recipe of this Perry movie. However, there were also some lose ends that seemed to hang out there left unanswered.Madea is once again facing jail time for actions that she takes when a woman steals her parking space. Willing to do things that the average person is afraid to do, she takes things into her own hands and issues her own brand of justice. Facing a less lenient Judge (Judge Mathis), Madea is sentenced to some prison time. Meanwhile, an over zealous prosecutor, fueled by jealousy, insures a stiff sentence for her fianc&eacute;e's friend, Candace (played by Cosby show's Keshia Knight Pulliam) by committing prosecutorial misconduct. Surrounded by several interesting characters, both Madea and Candace (rape victim turned prostitute) do what they have to do in order to survive prison.Although there were some funny situations and lines in this latest Perry production (the Uncle is still a hoot), I don't think it offered anything new or original. Perry's formula of victimization, laughs and someone done someone wrong worked to a point, but would have been better if some of the storylines had been followed through.  I thought Madea would pass along some of her wisdom or influence Candace more than she did. Instead, Candace and Madea seem to just be in the same institution with no real interaction. In other Perry movies,  Madea was instrumental in helping the main character recognize her victimization as well as provide support for her to do something about it. In this movie, Madea was just in the prison and providing some comic relief but in my opinion not really influencing Candace. Then again, maybe I have come to expect a lot in Perry movies and was just disappointed. Was it the worse movie to watch on a Sunday evening, no...would I have paid to see it in the theater, no.",0.5,388,0.04104665352447342,0.05167991983739888,0.0,0.04777970049697383,0.03776176928512645,0.187071792900551,0.033558385669788776,0.12643079011230132,0.0,0.0355355178916848,0.0,0.09654365328240251,0.0,0.1167836207189485,0.15653050418907039,0.0,0.24361873565556416,0.050271136525528566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046694531794334936,0.08500935909022825,0.0,0.0,0.038029547412396794,0.03926973982428356,0.04645980843251786,0.04024184681340468,0.16644776575253967,0.0,0.3499802669511007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038823649132680556,0.2546159936726169,0.048790123743845795,0.11709552233707034,0.0911130176396863,0.0,0.12014701520133675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04119163292099585,0.0,0.12127674664770087,0.1493546030516857,0.04643862358383294,0.040417973527874275,0.1398585261105951,0.03283484022604629,0.20424335180586367,0.031337417860572515,0.0,0.0,0.12497418222569838,0.09542262752562693,0.08123742245558327,0.0,0.0,0.04517729919898789,0.04466241641114697,0.0,0.15946930070838478,0.054216756828308295,0.0,0.33590665017101956,0.0,0.04650225439538565,0.08392480153335377,0.21685482552973911,0.0,0.0,0.05111252331605266,0.1993459635745153,0.0393617430342771,0.08799286088899831,0.08508873949114942,0.2948744151917274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182234787941731,0.04820736315693577,0.0,0.0,0.04329482111787221,0.09642642755197237,0.041023254914530474,0.04235847569002839,0.0,0.0397056536776322,0.0,0.05968111283537603,0.13382950058715382,0.0,
818277,B0001Z52RU,A3TSJWU8JW0D18,2,2,1310860800,"""Butterfly Effect"": Metaphore for Child Abuse Repurcussions","I thought this was a very engaging story, with very good character acting. The sci-fi mechanism is handled with a minimum of fuss, and lets the character-driven story shine. I haven't seen any other analysis that touches on this point: I think ""The Butterfly Effect"", that a single small event has massive repurcusions downstream in time, is an extended metaphore for the latency effects of child abuse, which is the real (and terrible) event at the center of this film. Many reviewers complained about the unrelieved grimness of the events in the narrative, but it only goes to show that the Freudian ""return of the repressed"" repeats the grimness of the original event. Try as he may, the main character can't seem to stop (or block out) all the repurcussions of the original child abuse event. The metaphore is given filmic visual gravitas in the image of the ""perfect"" gabled house (the mailbox which perfectly models the house behind it) being blown apart violently, an unconscious acting out of violence by the kids who were damaged by the abusive father -- an image that says that families are blown apart by domestic sexual abuse, which says the ""address"" of the issue is the home where it starts. Looked at in this light, the narrative is cohesive and justified. An excellent film that is underrated in my opinion.",1.0,227,0.055283227355500016,0.0,0.04689882344294257,0.0,0.20343607066441008,0.08398518572332953,0.045197737339545685,0.04257047477906132,0.10085291719549322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039322179162271535,0.15811602240599051,0.05600896299044225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10461549306309302,0.0,0.03816463562312392,0.0,0.0,0.051219671649304584,0.0,0.0,0.05419928241565936,0.0,0.05576637429959648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171463355205769,0.0,0.22079231700913843,0.09203591346765728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06910173392416956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054436496716055244,0.0,0.0,0.3056476441157842,0.04220645162430601,0.0,0.06231830331875881,0.05610669434502218,0.06425945064209838,0.10941371609524962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07302123405578353,0.0,0.0,0.11819983052688841,0.0,0.22606636524789062,0.7168954149503175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11851220298110247,0.05730040973836579,0.06109974096687058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175855007314413,0.04090681516767772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493542907530762,0.0,0.0,0.18899624492425587,0.05347711667287367,0.0,0.0803808409798901,0.0,0.0,

531756,B00003CXPJ,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,0,1,1086998400,"Hilarious in parts, though perhaps a bit overstretched","I usually love to read the reviews of film critic Roger Ebert (of the Chicago Sun-Times of course), but his one-star review of ZOOLANDER is probably the silliest, least perceptive review of his I've read. From what I understand, he pretty much condemned the whole movie (despite humorous aspects that he at least recognized) based upon one small detail: the fact that the filmmakers made one of its characters the prime minister of Malaysia. He apparently found the fact that they actually named a real-life country &quot;offensive,&quot; and even said that this movie---or at least, that one detail---is proof of why a lot of foreign countries seem to hate us so much. Okay, in the context of his review he isn't totally without merit, but still, isn't that going a little too far, Mr. Ebert? (I could almost give him a pass on this rather trivial criticism b/c this movie was indeed released soon after 9/11 drastically shook up our country---but giving this funny movie only one measly star on the basis of that one tiny detail is kinda rash.)Here is the real lowdown on ZOOLANDER: this movie is very funny, sometimes hilariously so. It's a silly comedy that still has a palpable intelligence underneath the surface stupidity. The idea, though---which originated as a sketch created for the 1996 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards by writers Ben Stiller and Drake Sather---might not have been enough to sustain even an 89-minute film. ZOOLANDER makes its satirical points hilariously early on, but kinda runs out of steam towards the end---at the very least, I wasn't laughing quite as hard towards the end as I was for the first half of the movie. Still, its funny bits are so funny that this film is on its way to becoming a popular new classic...and the fact that a lot of people I know seem to love quoting from this movie is proof of that. (My personal favorite bit: the model building that our lamebrained hero condemns as a &quot;center for ants.&quot;)In short, ZOOLANDER is hardly a great movie, but on its own terms it works very well. And no, I have not heard one complaint from those who have seen the movie about the Malaysia detail. It's so small and insignificant (and hardly emphasized by the filmmakers) that I'm surprised Mr. Ebert picked up on it at all, much less was bothered enough by it to spend nearly a whole review discussing it.",0.0,407,0.03705397964349826,0.04665293107246473,0.031434272785558055,0.0,0.03408862136737379,0.11258334619778915,0.030294107624038506,0.1141326641973236,0.1351947821974411,0.0,0.0,0.04357634857251118,0.0,0.13177986307196324,0.10597839807482956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311543752927326,0.10517892684051283,0.04215247972744852,0.0767403622650517,0.10283092514598453,0.0,0.0,0.035449909191425204,0.0,0.03632745777318035,0.09015427462640382,0.14951124939223534,0.0,0.048460840875975714,0.10893190873443719,0.0,0.0,0.04596981744603874,0.0,0.1691287246473577,0.12337546222369945,0.23691320733038645,0.0,0.0,0.08540975870888587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24632991633232837,0.0,0.12576439235818304,0.03648645235939531,0.042084754253123115,0.0592818852142488,0.3072937885026367,0.1980242384327833,0.21147890967589436,0.04176928976562196,0.037605914299386464,0.0,0.03666766398099524,0.04764031570468159,0.27932952588750043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13537892560890286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32829897257207574,0.4271149277039935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035532963101488894,0.13900889459521185,0.0,0.12285761882808384,0.04565651118519007,0.0,0.07750970952779798,0.1123604546303276,0.082254258787553,0.0,0.04606002904792552,0.0,0.0390834643660787,0.0,0.037032857053906514,0.0,0.04222536290008081,0.03584342100448126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

We've seen them all before... only this time it's the politicians playing God and withholding information from the people. The funny part is that they wait till the last minute to tell people what is happening...but by the time they tell them this the State of California has already sunk into the ocean and a massive Volcanic erruption occurs at yellow stone... Yes... I'm sure everyone hasn't figured out to ""RUN THE HELL FOR THEIR LIVES!"" and they really are depending on the Government at that point to lead them. Yeah.... right. The entire movie seems to revolve around this plot of being moral and doing what is right. Yet... the people that get saved are all the immoral politcal leaders and super wealthy that couldn't care less about the people they step on.What point does it make being a politcal leader and fleeing your country leaving your people to die while you escape safely. Yes... that's exactly the type of trash that make it to safety in this movie.. and all for the sake of humanity. Sure... if that's what humanity is down to than we are already doomed. The more interesting part about the movie is that it's ideal that a plot like this could happen. The lower classes of society always get the short end of the stick. In the end it always comes down to status... but strangely enough what good is money when the economy has been destroyed by mother nature herself?The Kings didn't build the Pyramids.. the slaves built them. It's the working class that drives society... not politicians that judge the world from affar. It's just funny watching this movie thinking what sort of world will be created by these people.On top of that the movie itself is a lot of long winded speeches and even one when there's only but a few minutes left till doomsday and the politicians are still playing God decided the fates of people. When will they learn that without the people they have no power or authority? I suppose that's the part of the film that made this ""fiction"". How everyone kept order and all of sudden no longer worried about their own families because they were so set on saving politicians and Giraffs (ok well the animals were worth it). Very unrealistic... who would continue to work for these slimes knowing that they wouldn't get another paycheck?On top of that you can put the annoying main family that added nothing to the film. They were the classic family in distress. Annoying kids yelling mommy... save daddy where's daddy yatta yatta. SHEESH! enough already! I kept routing that they would fall in an earthquake crack. Every moment with them off film was a blessing.Overall 3/5This is a long film 2 hours Plus with a lot more dialogue than needed for this type of film.",0.5,489,0.08621504888571685,0.0,0.09751925491650054,0.0,0.05287695025673194,0.16008201890714732,0.09398209476676035,0.0,0.0524272285477773,0.02487979042663563,0.035344925662472645,0.033796972764114475,0.0,0.061323547139671024,0.08219479489795835,0.02911561494777599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032231362544982836,0.13595790079690134,0.0,0.07935778676099904,0.05316911719797573,0.09751820068121768,0.026625956951696367,0.0,0.0,0.05634974664784965,0.023307303647734093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034937171204467786,0.027181938278275374,0.07130660181909564,0.03415985261102804,0.13117296624852948,0.12758349496542395,0.0,0.0280398573591122,0.026672118002725953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057679710622430005,0.0,0.10613817594470148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06528024214376195,0.02298894154311044,0.23833111632388143,0.10970269115810359,0.023431278613402665,0.06479090583902865,0.029166419467916083,0.0,0.02843873067582227,0.2955912562826562,0.0,0.03163037441970827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02624931879059172,0.0,0.0,0.06511605359177934,0.37214032940334174,0.5383008692536475,0.06622659227402912,0.17439359745934513,0.0,0.027913963777014387,0.27558678629784517,0.13861621140349215,0.05957391735950362,0.15880998651089392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029048198157200993,0.021264937173808982,0.0,0.0,0.06951638832836243,0.030312378709510597,0.1012678068909027,0.17233180414080257,0.08897042118580595,0.0,0.027799463772082006,0.061367975892315775,0.04178505528745933,0.06246613951443822,0.045847694727093505,
485057,6305958181,A1EJ3H3MMXZ3O3,3,4,1147996800,Whittaker is Excellent as are the Useless wiseguys,"I like Jarmusch films in general. And this moving is hauntingly interesting. A modern day pigeon keeping rooftop samurai who has aligned himself with a mobster who inadvertantly saved his life (or, well, pay attention - he perhaps remembers it wrongly) -Just the same there's enough oddities here for some enjoyable surprises.The one problem I had with the movie was that they didn't seem to understand how carrier pigeons work... having a single pigeon flying back and forth delivering messages as if it were a bicycle messenger, but it's a minor problem.Forrest Whittaker plays this role beautifully, believably, and memorably, moving from scene to scene with something akin to grace - I hesitate to say GRACE... for some reason, probably because it's a violent film.The depiction of the aging NY gangsters is worth the price however. The wiseguys will remind you of relatives if you're from RI or Ma.They are pathetic - Whittaker is Grace.see  - it works on this dichotomy.I've had it for a few years and just pulled it out this past weekend to show it to a girlfriend who is going to buy her own copy ASAP.",0.75,190,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17654034130826746,0.0712556378922343,0.06711367679689642,0.0,0.0,0.10719170414677089,0.0,0.0,0.06199263778341488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08246478839881054,0.0,0.18050320323475635,0.16124770879010794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19729931700441675,0.08544685351870725,0.0,0.0879174225869509,0.10616067946551959,0.0,0.0854072871202163,0.10595509395711104,0.1648710943055834,0.05406346188768144,0.0,0.19890625778137636,0.38692660940761553,0.0,0.17007477243313823,0.08088939864291544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06437773876334382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963726024075688,0.06653978297772645,0.07106079975647374,0.0,0.17690789543489818,0.0,0.08624706228054294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483319616443579,0.0,0.0,0.11512024536171835,0.0,0.17831044426346984,0.0,0.0,0.05940010868502469,0.2930168646323054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465558466080764,0.16715619970853493,0.186838171964059,0.0,0.33713974324161206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06449086570451538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919293355330098,0.10237272246189598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25292501032982156,0.0930563269357728,0.19008434167759672,0.0,0.13904379304483927,
1569376,B008KJZJE0,A32U6577WUD9L5,1,2,1367712000,Not a totally bad film but grates on the nerves of an ex basketball coach,"I really wanted to like this one, but the unrealistic portrayal of high school basketball was too much for me to overcome. I had to force myself to watch to the end. The acting for the most part was good by the principals, but there were some less than stellar performances by others. Ben Davies was almost enough to hold this movie together by himself--but not quite. The main problem I had was watching a basketball team with only eight players coached by a man who talked more like a cheerleader than a coach. If they had been a poor team, I'd have been comfortable with it, but watching them work their way through to the state championship was more than I could suspend my disbelief. A four-on-four practice scrimmage is not going to prepare a team to win the state championship. In real life, teams would bring up sophomores and maybe freshmen to pad their roster so they'd have enough players for a full scrimmage and a bench. To make things worse, they hosted all of the tournament games in their small home gym, including the state championship. Tournaments are held in large neutral gyms, not in crackerbox local high school gyms. I realize that they saved a lot on expenses by shooting in on location, but I think it was a big mistake. And lastly, the new kid in town, who was billed to be some kind of a hotshot, was a lame basketball player. I think I had more serious basketball skills at fifty-five years of age than his character portrayed. A pretty good Christian message was somewhat lost by ignoring some small details which anyone associated with basketball could have helped avoid.  Here is the perfect example of where a movie producer should have gotten input from others before shooting to avoid story issues. People can stomach a sermon if it's delivered via a good story. I'm afraid this one was not palatable for me.",0.5,329,0.0,0.0,0.042135801516413655,0.0,0.0,0.07545569070112514,0.04060747689858475,0.0,0.04530517174349371,0.04299991471773672,0.0,0.11682308585837321,0.0,0.1766431879032202,0.2841156706103336,0.05032071967810886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371546144238456,0.04594627739875753,0.0,0.13805347937843068,0.0,0.22487560828464806,0.0,0.16112869955367773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04867228111760337,0.0,0.09395746570094225,0.18485954329523746,0.0,0.05667678731651249,0.08268879041225928,0.0,0.0,0.09219521384961406,0.0,0.0,0.11316210187102312,0.1495323671448392,0.05965467316101085,0.07337573887330298,0.0,0.05619326724885448,0.048907952321387546,0.0,0.15892778980107458,0.1373031082761644,0.11375995416073646,0.08099288336650896,0.05598928644070333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06385905283719485,0.0,0.05466699595192116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045366880107870704,0.15242451250992922,0.10619551265318938,0.22508105600475617,0.033851195674489104,0.2862612719118029,0.17168981958832313,0.06028113331728886,0.0,0.04824389760777904,0.19051942327385465,0.07985712053352335,0.0,0.35681412451438477,0.061199879073230344,0.0,0.051948612880884745,0.0,0.3675233871636209,0.058333538597456505,0.0617407711335792,0.0,0.0,0.05834061816559395,0.0,0.0,0.056600625764556094,0.09609201290687738,0.0,0.10832610221144238,0.05398033154233259,0.0,

927589,B000ALM40I,A30TK6U7DNS82R,3,5,1158451200,Tries to Do Something Different--and Succeeds,"I guess Hilary Swank made this movie before she went into boxing in Clint Eastwood's MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but her portrayal here of the dentally challenged 7-11 clerk at the all night concenience store is definitely a sketch for her Oscar winning portrayal.  She must have hung out with some lower class people in order to ape them so brilliantly here and in the Eastwood film.  Marcks' commentary here says that her part was originally written for a boy, but when she moved in on the film and took a producer's credit, Swank had him re-write the part so she could play it.  I think if a man had played it as Greg Marcks had planned, it would have been more of a shock when you found out that ""he"" resented Shawn Hatosy's affair with Rachael Leigh Cook because ""he"" and Shawn had had something going on last summer.  Now it's just a jibe.  That's not to take away from Swank's fine acting, though someone might have asked her to tone down the braces just aa little bit.  She's worried about losing her job (which must pay her what, $6 an hour?) because she's the sole support of herself AND her sister who has TB?  And yet she has $12,000 worth of orthodontia filling her face, where'd she get the money for all that hardware.  Marcks' commentary is excellent at suggesting the pros and cons of working with a high-powered Oscar winner like Hilary Swank, who at that date was always trailed everywhere by her mournful hound-dog husband, the ineffectual yet sweet Chad Lowe.  It can't have been easy filming all these actors in a limited time frame and almost no budget.  They must have had Barbara Hershey, for example, from what, 10:30 at night till 11:45?And yet she gets to shine in her role as she has in few other studio pictures of recent years, as the mother of a tramp who seems strangely connected to the wild forest in which she and Patrick Swayze have built their eco-friendly home.  The movie suffers a bit towards the end, once you figure that neither Hershey nor Swank is likely to be further featured, but by that time other actors emerge from the murk to pick up the slack, and even some whom you might have written off, like Shawn Hatosy (from THE FACULTY) and Rachael Leigh Cook (from SHE'S ALL THAT) reveal they're not just pretty faces, they've got personality too, and talent galore.",0.6,414,0.03398047344961036,0.0,0.11530761144409384,0.0,0.03126108192567966,0.2064898530818693,0.0,0.0784993002668802,0.12398081801699519,0.02941807963751754,0.08358429231844312,0.07992366649658933,0.0,0.07250949314583321,0.06479189148123209,0.03442655522982208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03811064216838837,0.06430311967115394,0.0,0.09383333423471665,0.15716906143148562,0.038435454969055545,0.0,0.0,0.23077052349330246,0.09994264256336065,0.1929113035765606,0.06855489058490885,0.41390167904322095,0.044441172920567255,0.0,0.0,0.03214015919186835,0.16862708688648473,0.040390905521505,0.0581625191754648,0.09428489325485637,0.0,0.09946371042561944,0.06307468656692866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03410049464771689,0.0,0.05019947932004025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03859396179008142,0.0543646470891041,0.13150889531678817,0.05188536478159534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07899562528753608,0.06725240281088521,0.043688707623555915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5280666630246287,0.0,0.062074843667936336,0.06952008280576581,0.0,0.0,0.18527239911320925,0.2774450603406325,0.039153448084374515,0.04124089994616518,0.0,0.0,0.09775686073719678,0.01821122318419394,0.07044071574351098,0.13144481224352594,0.0418694531884759,0.0,0.035540266552158285,0.0,0.05028769169986236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06792220581922256,0.07013293094370186,0.07744581482103363,0.09861098004891596,0.0,0.07411051679048097,0.03693025213180059,0.0813160668689331,
1324238,B0034G4P7G,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,0,0,1337472000,Facebook Film: Fact or Fantasy,"So this week was a big week for Facebook: Zuckerberg turned 28, Facebook went public with an IPO and Zuckerberg got married to his college sweetheart, Priscilla Chan, who just graduated from Med school with a degree in pediatrics. Happened to have this film SOCIAL NETWORK film in the house and watched it with my son who joined Facebook in 2004 when he was a student at NYU. It is fun to recall how it first entered out lives. Myspace was just so junky looking, my son commented. And when you're in college you really want to know people's status.This is a fascinating look at the company's origins--did Zuckerberg really steal the idea from some Harvard twins?And cheat his partner by diluting his stock? One more good reason for Eduardo to move to Singapore and avoid hundreds of millions on his taxes when Facebook went public.It was hard to tell the hype from the honest story and you were so entertained by the film, you really don't care. You are willing to watch the suspenseful unfolding of the success. The script by Sorkin is masterful. You hang onto the repartee. It's fun to watch smart people interact--too bad their character doesn't always keep up with their intellect.My son commented he wanted to know how the ideas came up for some of the features of Facebook and wished the film had featured that more. And show how use of Facebook has evolved. We'll probably need another film--perhaps a documentary--on that. It is reported that Facebook created their own film when it went public that is more interesting than this one. Truth is often more interesting than fiction, if stranger. But in the meantime, this fictional film regarding Facebook's origins is worth watching.I heard Zuckerberg say after seeing this film that he doesn't remember partying as much as the film indicated they did--they were working most of the time. But he agreed it was an entertaining film.I loved it and am looking forward to Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, take on Steve Jobs in an upcoming film, based on Walter Isaacson's biography. If you're fascinated by Facebook and social networking, you should enjoy this film.",0.0,362,0.0,0.049417400580942315,0.0,0.0,0.1083257376528164,0.19875765537493967,0.0320892174893353,0.06044785886280798,0.07160294706807188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05583544812490931,0.14967768241487062,0.0,0.0,0.04807029304916822,0.0,0.0,0.44564566820274165,0.0446502701606423,0.08128769480503162,0.10892428199537653,0.0,0.036364634161648875,0.0,0.04442582286209548,0.03848008027783016,0.03183215431399981,0.15837069896202177,0.0,0.0,0.1538490478869694,0.14314724369886975,0.07424794106647332,0.1460814249699619,0.0,0.15675680017462854,0.19602931150555145,0.0,0.0765913620801501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575531410299832,0.04714086979842883,0.0,0.0,0.04440556547475814,0.11594548877675358,0.0,0.0,0.1302011247171818,0.1198619298528875,0.06400294842073415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03884044576967028,0.10092658749882183,0.0,0.12959838359109788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051843176204874344,0.10755071187233498,0.08030020916020839,0.041959402087826086,0.08893282112681082,0.13375103099677998,0.3204670575273203,0.13567432360384976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07527701394309631,0.14724601585815536,0.040681799987223176,0.2385857446655575,0.04836193676367893,0.0,0.0821026305656579,0.0,0.14521387197442007,0.09219374115024397,0.0,0.04747130843759139,0.0,0.09220493011439757,0.0,0.16201617709611338,0.0,0.07593472278166265,0.0,0.11413661125565078,0.0,0.2504675642539852,

1548029,B0087ITCFQ,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,0,0,1403481600,"Too Teen-Oriented For Adults, But Too Maturely-Themed For Adolescents","Was this movie terrible? No. I don't feel like it riotously earned so many 1 star votes. Obviously people haven't seen truly terrible productions. You have to go into this movie expecting it to be a bit of a risqu&eacute; teen chick-flick featuring none other than the infamous Miley Cyrus. I'm guessing this was Miley Cyrus's attempt at transitioning from Hannah Montana to a grown girl. It's a well-played move on her part to take this role. As it wasn't too 'adult', but definitely separated her from her sweet innocent image. Obviously, since this movie was made she's made an avid attempt at recreating herself. But during the time when this movie was made, I'm assuming the ENTIRE purpose of it was to bring Miley from little girl to grown teen woman in the eyes of the public. Did it work? I don't know.Miley's acting tends to follow her spirited personality in Hannah Montana. In this film you see a few serious scenes from her, but nothing that's going to really 'wow' you as a viewer and make you think she's definitely ready for more mature roles. In the film she plays the teenage daughter of Demi Moore. Her mother is concerned about Miley's character Lola losing her virginity. All the while all Lola really cares about is dating a guy she actually cares about.The film is... forgettable. I honestly watched it two months ago and am having trouble recalling enough of the film to write a thorough review. There was definitely nothing that stuck out as amazing or worthwhile. The storyline was predictable. The acting was mediocre. Nothing really shown brightly.Ironically enough in the film Lola's mother (Demi) is a pot smoker? It's such a weird additive to the film. I don't understand the point of it at all. If the film was targeted towards teen girls, I'm guessing this was a way of showing that no matter how strict Lola's mother may seem she's actually &#34;cool&#34; because she smokes weed? I think having Demi's character smoke pot was a very sad attempt at making her seem relatable to the kids. I mean- I'm not necessarily 'anti marijuana' but would I want my teen daughter watching a film where the mother is smoking pot? Heck no. That's a ridiculous example of parenting. If some mom wants to go out with her friends and have a good time occasionally- fine. And I don't necessarily have anything against parents who responsibly smoke. But I sure as heck don't want my child thinking that pot-smoking parents are cool. Just like I don't want them thinking cigarette-smoking or drinking is cool. I was really offended to see that involved in the film at all. And I think a lot of other parents would be disappointed as well.Overall, I don't know who'd I'd recommend this film for. Older teens 17 to 19 in age? It's a bit too 'young' for them. But it's a bit too maturely-written for anyone under 16. And most adults are bound to find it boring and stupidly scripted. I want to give this film more than 2 stars. But nothing made it magnificent. Is it a one star movie? No. It's not TERRIBLE. But it's certainly not memorable. It's barely decent. I like both Miley and Demi. But participation in this film was not one of their greatest choices.",0.0,560,0.0875833680656556,0.0,0.09906698316858868,0.0,0.026858080209776185,0.11827104064541893,0.04773684237220309,0.11240496559436422,0.13314825294157365,0.05054931524126073,0.03590588503467666,0.0,0.0,0.1868904397657374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25028762418177936,0.0,0.0,0.33147765326343054,0.0,0.08061727432269494,0.10802592868558386,0.0,0.027048537557427088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07103164170457292,0.0,0.32004471467172224,0.0,0.0,0.035491659105011064,0.05522668572907416,0.14487661802318244,0.03470200368692094,0.11659796103152319,0.2754177922421286,0.0,0.02848487798048978,0.08128629369171608,0.0,0.03649185528030637,0.0,0.05859514540276176,0.03506405651063385,0.10782269510633138,0.0,0.0,0.057494614022539046,0.13263260994425838,0.09341519628569848,0.16140911323700655,0.022288756549287067,0.047606312948145976,0.0,0.05925863951667949,0.06786939892989452,0.05778016363250555,0.03753532319849208,0.0,0.12852952057258576,0.06353233892594566,0.0,0.22684526443043088,0.0,0.026665921771459992,0.029864224863147396,0.0,0.06614951058337322,0.11938312710682167,0.266411297977954,0.03363883731342019,0.07086455941037473,0.0,0.028356986341147413,0.0,0.17210867607789637,0.06051941509801502,0.25812873610077564,0.10791691100925704,0.03687436410176809,0.0,0.029509222157011593,0.2808316293379608,0.0,0.03629023131506917,0.0,0.06158693304181231,0.0,0.0,0.0301274902946547,0.0,0.056481338212904096,0.0,0.021224112983665045,0.06345753971543604,0.0931506871281283,
1015658,B000HRMCUC,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,1,1,1160784000,Seen before and done better but it has some pluses,"Personally, romantic comedies are critic-proof: you're not supposed to see some big character study epic a la films by Spielberg or Scorsese. What you're ultimately there to see is ""was the film funny?"" So do you mind that the same concept was used for Bruce Almighty? I didn't. I saw it for one reason: I want to laugh, and I will admit that I did on a few parts. But then there will be parts that just simply didn't fit or came out of left field and it becomes just a generic comedy with a few bright spots.Michael Newman(Adam Sandler) is a young architect who's being overworked by his demanding boss(David Hasselhoff in another ""so bad it's funny"" roles). He cancels camping trips, forgets events with his kids and unbelievably, can't figure out what remote controls what. So he decides to get a universal remote but thanks to Morty, a quirky salesman(a delightful Christopher Walken), he now has a remote control that actually controls life itself. Dog's too loud? Mute it. Fight with the missus? Skip it. Feel like hitting your boss? Pause it and wail on him. Only, of course, the remote is ""special"" so it remembers Michael's attitude towards certain events and skips them without warning. Pretty soon he skips entire sections of his life and trying to figure out how to save his life while it's passing by.Now for some good: the casting. Kate Beckinsale is just simply lovely, being a charming wife and still having some spunk and not that ""ball and chain"" feeling. And of course Chris Walken who acts like he knows it's a terrible movie and decides to just go with it. And Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner are memorable but their roles are just too small. As for Adam Sandler, well...it's kind of like a more tamer version of other comedy roles he's done but he still manages to go for kids swearing and a very horny dog with a thing for a plush duck doll. He kind of works but then he doesn't.The film's tone is probably its biggest problem. Some of the laughs do work such as life based on a DVD menu complete with audio commentary by none other than James Earl Jones. Or when he decides to change his skin color from Hulk green to Barney purple. But other jokes such as farting, the aforementioned kid profanity or ""kid getting hit by"" jokes don't tend to work. Then the film becomes a complete morality play and we see Michael in the future reacting to missing chunks of his life and it becomes more drama than anything. Not to mention the ending is downright atrocious(save for a good use of a U2 song).The main thing about this movie is this: can you stomach these kinds of movies, especially one who brought you such comedy ""masterpieces"" as Billy Madison or the Longest Yard? Hm, in the words of Oasis, definately maybe.",1.0,491,0.035845212172506455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29042846646090165,0.0879175780152088,0.11040945138221743,0.0,0.03103244891152626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15297716026161476,0.17086865348174016,0.0726315469624885,0.08509892543190939,0.04390076657129206,0.042139436249431166,0.0,0.10174780104452974,0.0,0.17321955840604908,0.033158798463003195,0.04054466870085389,0.06642086887833543,0.0,0.0,0.03514239075251138,0.0,0.36158480871713705,0.0,0.0468799610722036,0.2107567078359505,0.04357697399875173,0.0,0.06670529896134035,0.0,0.14316001123375968,0.23870146542089707,0.045836934466588736,0.17486992978276436,0.09980403272155523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07194363949327778,0.0,0.05295426474397242,0.04347611782883531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860220052178842,0.23781544987388376,0.08209899923858353,0.058451453491642796,0.04040670039625111,0.18189570863532467,0.12499597540910731,0.10641449646552932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11700835426984559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13096262152744437,0.1466702411970936,0.0,0.08121895609875317,0.12214971904692579,0.24102264109069324,0.04130206296127148,0.04350406744472102,0.133906597904044,0.06963391893374005,0.0,0.03842119268445835,0.0,0.27731615869516313,0.08833422732107077,0.0,0.0,0.036231684826419495,0.05304731793452477,0.0,0.0,0.04335373675423366,0.037808491452672004,0.0,0.10747433591935149,0.03699079993227056,0.0,0.10402243240176881,0.07654399591096503,0.15635492557266614,0.0,0.1429640503328563,
489991,B0000039ET,A121660P9WJSER,1,2,1389916800,Perhaps THE silliest of all Godzilla films finally on legit video release!,"My rating is based primarily on just how absurd this entry in the series is, and that's saying something. It is a fine film for young kids, but goofy beyond belief for anyone over the age of five or six. The villains are ridiculous (subterranean toga party, dude!) and the bug monster Megalon is poorly executed, with the wires that support him during his absurd seesaw flight scenes painfully obvious, even for a Godzilla movie. The ever-dwindling budgets of these films really starts to show in this particular entry. Jet Jaguar, the new robot buddy for Godzy to team up with is a poor knock off of Ultraman, Goldar, and a host of other Japanese robotic TV heroes whose shows never saw stateside release. The robot's huge grin makes him look like a spongy cybernetic Jack Nicholson. How does he suddenly grow from 6 feet to 150? Why... because he figured it would come in handy, so he programmed himself to be able to, that's how! ??? Remember folks, this is the 70's Godzilla. It's best not to ask. and as for poor Godzilla himself... he looks like a giant, puffy puppy in this picture! The huge, Disney-esque eyes kill ANY resemblance to the fierce radioactive terror of Tokyo from past movies. And let's not forget his infamous sliding tail jump kicks! Wow. This entire film was made much easier to digest when the crew of MST3K spoofed it. Sadly, their adaption is no longer legally available. I bought this DVD because I am one of those guys that has to have every entry in a series of films, no mater how bad. I've only watched it once, just to make sure it wasn't defective and would play correctly. It's one of those Godzilla films I will watch maybe once every five years or so.On the good side, we finally get this heretofore legally unavailable G-film in a nice, widescreen edition instead of the old, washed out, pan&scan; public domain (which it never really ever was) junk versions found in dollar DVD bins at lesser retailers around the country. The colors of this print are bright & vivid, the clarity is sharp & crisp, and the sound is strong & clean. The optional English dub seems to have been cleaned up a bit, but still sounds as tinny (and as goofy) as ever. It is good to have though, if you don't like to read subtitles, plus the nostalgia factor makes the English dub a nice bonus, since this is the movie a lot of people were exposed to as their first Godzilla film. Not because it was so great, but because it was so readily (&#34;cheaply&#34;) available on VHS (in crummy &#34;EP&#34; speed, no less!) from GoodTimes home video. Others may remember NBC network's notorious prime-time debut of a heavily-edited version of &#34;Godzilla VS Megalon&#34; as the NBC movie-of-the-week, hosted by none other than SNL superstar John Belushi(!), wearing a cheesy G-costume originally built for the 1976 film &#34;Hollywood Boulevard.&#34; Now I have to admit that the Belushi-hosted version of GvsM is something I would LOVE to have in my collection! Here's to someday, maybe. Anyhow, the excellent quality of the source materials Tokyo Shock used for their DVD master makes this movie much more enjoyable and easily ups my overall rating by another star. So, I give this quirky Godzilla outing 3 out of 5 stars.",0.5,568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15035859885024963,0.05394497770883207,0.15242776175445227,0.030092813768032387,0.028561605129064676,0.16230165813727057,0.038798389138076164,0.03966417114857107,0.07039846029578127,0.06290554797778503,0.0,0.0,0.040405330666854464,0.11635271924066003,0.037001093417409876,0.156077515531659,0.037530641395504334,0.15942759277328336,0.09155595592419725,0.03731644965642454,0.06113235325516865,0.03156297892719738,0.0,0.03234430807656031,0.1337820761337917,0.13311798313682383,0.0,0.08629463568457695,0.06465866191303872,0.16042927551355163,0.031204434379622406,0.18418240993952295,0.0,0.22587672974855816,0.20138776673114694,0.0,0.06437862377722268,0.09185750634789693,0.03802247277628637,0.0,0.0,0.03310769685971459,0.0,0.09747595517384544,0.04001449300737156,0.07464991131304555,0.0974576087681216,0.11241102518555159,0.07917282172761372,0.32832041352523766,0.07556217056633435,0.05379747304532278,0.037189466566961454,0.06696517467281027,0.07669575594964144,0.06529442427015585,0.04241675973137924,0.0,0.07262233714742268,0.0,0.08926358053792913,0.0,0.04357661550420265,0.1506690099369136,0.0,0.0,0.03737609880066239,0.11242400018094145,0.4436642123619038,0.11404061761404685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19449126153188914,0.03419495651764143,0.3099292912336772,0.0,0.0,0.06901110282874388,0.0,0.09764724352380022,0.03874657673482242,0.0,0.03990185607246486,0.0,0.03875127915879125,0.0,0.03404554452295662,0.03759553324133441,0.0,0.03522473189986797,0.04796858128430519,0.10756520735229366,0.02631621348930752,

700428,B000065V3A,A19RAJY6R7USN0,7,8,1122940800,The Best Of Disney,"In the mid-1980s, the Walt Disney Company wanted to break out into a market in which they could target more than just the family audience and have some mature themes. Thus, Touchstone Pictures was born- their first film being Splash!THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN was produced under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, but it quite easily could have been produced by Touchstone Pictures since it goes slightly beyond the regular Disney family fare. Set during the Depression, it tells the story of a teenage girl called Natty Gann (played by Meredith Salenger who would go on to guest star in the second season of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and the fifth season of ""Dawson's Creek""), who travels across America to be reunited with her father, who due to necessary circumstances has had to take a job on the other side of the country. Along the way, Natty is befriended by a Wolf and a fellow traveller (John Cusack of ""Serendipity"".)This movie is what it is. It's not particularly action-oriented, or overly-romantic (a fake kiss between John Cusack and a much younger Meredith Salenger - probably due to various child laws - is towards the end of the picture). The cinematography is excellent and looks natural and beautiful, and the film travels at a nice pace. Being that this movie is what it is, it does a beautiful job at being just that.The DVD has no special features at all, and the film is only broadcast in Dolby (2.0) Surround, but there probably wasn't much extra material made at the time. This film is quite possibly the best of Disney's live action movies and it has a special place in my heart. Maybe it'll find a special place in your heart too.",0.875,291,0.0,0.0,0.0456914467033074,0.0,0.0,0.24546914116172858,0.0,0.0,0.19651306163435928,0.04662847841655242,0.0,0.06334062257169194,0.06475406196374907,0.0766197154449598,0.15404543825052908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06331752286918205,0.0,0.20384448370855024,0.0612709507873149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06096295490433076,0.15841188170949308,0.08736280221419558,0.0,0.06560457292130113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20045898419143218,0.06402071411665512,0.2765676553441745,0.26899954367387163,0.0,0.10510184059049346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05405023707417653,0.0,0.07956757772222108,0.06532598273494208,0.12187031375613325,0.053035067957354014,0.061172508080473684,0.04308474252318143,0.23822317091768114,0.08223975329674933,0.0,0.060713963074016046,0.05466226754031961,0.06260513694483913,0.05329846902938891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05509563711445465,0.057578430122344586,0.061018651029809585,0.07341548266984506,0.5690988144627416,0.062059309493728815,0.0,0.0,0.05231497674126302,0.05164911880856942,0.08659589316974835,0.05582525158277078,0.17858031522070697,0.06636425349198787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07970739680964249,0.0,0.06695078892879555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765859454697936,0.0,0.06137689049269998,0.15630115940613348,0.0,0.03915574679680321,0.0585354817739155,0.0,

Kick-Ass 2 may not be as good as the first, but it is still pretty damn good for a sequel! Lots of laugh-out-loud moments along with plenty of good fight scenes as well. Chloe Grace Mortez, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Jim Carrey all nail their roles and steal just about every scene they are in. Although, I did think Carrey was underused and would've liked to see more of him. The film does become a bit too cartoonish and a bit inconsistent, but I was having so much fun watching it didn't take that much enjoyment out of it. If you are a fan of the first than I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this one as well!

I don't remember a romantic action comedy this good since Romancing the Stone in the 80s. Steve Carrell and Tina Fey play a ""boring married couple from New Jersey"" who try to add some spice to their marriage by going on a date night in the city where they are mistaken for a couple involved in blackmail and chased all over town by thugs. The story is mediocre, but Carrell and Fey have outstanding chemistry and do a wonderful job of portraying a very normal couple in extremely absurd circumstances. Nothing profound or artistic here, but there are some tender moments interspersed with the raunchy humor and nearly nonstop action. This movie is a great choice for good old fashioned fun entertainment - especially if you watch with a date.",0.3333333333333333,156,0.0,0.0,0.08443705123000027,0.0,0.0,0.35281787730962083,0.2441232028685536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415919894212019,0.18978231156724332,0.0,0.11814828562222303,0.12190048890922119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27484777286189577,0.09207296500662122,0.0,0.276649032206389,0.09522363755367172,0.0,0.0,0.0807225196222825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882838597894246,0.3087041218676011,0.0,0.1703641780374818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470395910202574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0550290687269192,0.07598886403565719,0.0,0.0,0.10101498240185619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3054475270037334,0.10640400347909053,0.0,0.0,0.28682328105431076,0.11468459576354613,0.0,0.0,0.09667722713797433,0.09544673249551246,0.10668520252613488,0.0,0.11000450713728399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006055346931806,0.0,0.11689612656500528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09628066780041215,0.0,0.21707755193432762,0.0,0.1587889141180869,

I honestly was shocked when this series hit the air just because the idea of a TV series was long overdue.It obviously had a higher production budget than 'Saved By the Bell' but for some reason, this series never attained 90210/OC type ratings.Sweet Valley High  revolves around the adventures identical twins Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield (played by real-life twins Cynthia and Brittany Daniels) have while growing up in southern California. To the first season's credit, several of the episodes were loosely based on the series.Not to be missed episodes include ""Dangerous love"" which (in trying to incorporate some book elements) introduces us to the TV Sweet Valley gang for the very first time. Bridget Flanery plays a perfect Lila Fowler because she is so scheming and ruthless.""Almost married"" has Elizabeth invite Todd (Ryan James Bittle) over for the weekend after his parents' house is being painted and her parents are going away. Jessica blackmails Elizabeth into then having a party, but is in trouble when she cannot return the emergency credit card purchased outfit which was worn at the forbidden party. Because Elizabeth traditionally has the 'square' reputation, the idea of her and Todd living together for the weekend was a really neat plot development.When Enid's (Amy Danles) new boyfriend becomes the spokesperson for an anti-drug campaign in ""Secrets"", she is worried. Before meeting Ronnie (Drew Bell II), she used to have a drug problem. Jessica (ever the schemer) tries to use this overheard information to snag the publicity opportunity for herself. The absurdity of Steven Tyler (even in name) doing an anti-drug campaign with such an uptight and narrow-minded teen is second to how Ronnie treats Enid. He breaks up with her, but Enid is now free to find somebody who is not judgmental.Finally, at the season finale ""Say goodbye"" Todd has an opportunity to attend an exclusive basketball camp in Vermont, but this alternately means leaving Sweet Valley-and Elizabeth. Because a long distance relationship is a very realistic scenario for many teens and the young at heart, it made a wonderful close. We knew Elizabeth and Todd would somehow stay together, but had to watch the next season of this series in order to find out.Although several episodes in this season are loosely based on the series, there are some errors. In addition to Elizabeth and Jessica, the Wakefields are also supposed to have an eldest son named Steven, but he receives no mention. Plus, Alice and Ned Wakefield are (oddly considering their very active book presence) never actually seen in the series, the most presence they have is an off-camera voice.",1.0,453,0.0,0.04438946696647004,0.0,0.04103944904619265,0.22704318638381332,0.21424226140299385,0.14412162952497007,0.0,0.09647664434637909,0.03052254536292524,0.1734447241528352,0.0,0.0,0.1504635462991881,0.06722442359437837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039541459494566986,0.0,0.12032209317202415,0.19471238340663816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07981150660343507,0.10369486652148505,0.11437366966143464,0.07112869988494025,0.12883233300799204,0.0,0.03454895011027344,0.042860947566464434,0.0,0.218697480101092,0.041907332539052065,0.18103847890442454,0.03912988158125421,0.0,0.03439931782131122,0.0,0.0406329631993899,0.08813763769929751,0.0,0.0,0.04234455997458941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040042924758774925,0.05640570109819128,0.09746159680407959,0.05383333717672289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03488865590232293,0.0,0.0,0.03880416681638454,0.0,0.3815684271124569,0.1826307594447488,0.0,0.032202683776386756,0.10819519359621085,0.0,0.039942211440052645,0.0,0.474124650436485,0.04062341627990458,0.0,0.04390211270546437,0.03424487148134656,0.03380900739900735,0.11336964736033081,0.03654266301829325,0.27275949306409375,0.0,0.0,0.11062374683341963,0.10690905318260382,0.13043920354579713,0.04140678161127599,0.0,0.04264137840059153,0.0,0.04141180688728046,0.0,0.10914897875084491,0.08035342296881419,0.06820880558061113,0.0,0.051261936842459194,0.03831675316153539,0.0,
1076730,B000QUCNOU,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,5,5,1189036800,A Good Story About Obsession,"A couple of years ago, I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case. Since the murderer was never apprehended, this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years. There are websites and all kinds of people, apparently, who can't let go of this famous case.Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession. I, probably like a number of viewers, thought this was just another film about the murderer, and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie. However, it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer. That man is ""Robert Graysmith,"" a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer, so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him.For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed, brutal serial-killer story, this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of ""Graysmith"" plus an in- depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which, as any cop could tell you, can be tedious work. However, there is still is enough violence and suspense, particularly early on, to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself, and a lot of suspects to entertain the ""whodunit"" mystery-solving viewer. Director David Fincher doesn't offer up the edge-of-your-seat thrillers as he did in ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room,"" but this is still worth a look and recommended.",1.0,265,0.2923101191216169,0.0,0.04959551503429491,0.0,0.10756684241161835,0.2368382678806123,0.09559323228936446,0.13505485640747272,0.05332598990576886,0.15183783197000575,0.07190168930556887,0.0687527103143476,0.0,0.04158321221418927,0.05573590828591295,0.11845897880262299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063090453309814,0.06650619711539701,0.2017955484669905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463150367361002,0.04741372273444164,0.11794590362585959,0.0,0.07645923220922249,0.0,0.07107220009876161,0.0,0.07252901276966287,0.0,0.2334879187535643,0.12977066217545372,0.0,0.11408218148541506,0.0542587176464105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295492465840175,0.0,0.06614171156993623,0.0,0.06639934305190319,0.0,0.32322244389314875,0.1785333236450311,0.04766592327797354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11570502633529514,0.22549393872305026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053398623106112965,0.11960647762270124,0.18749451611763912,0.0,0.11953261290275875,0.3930977257948302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17035496155359997,0.0,0.18799001701548532,0.0,0.09691948217210414,0.0,0.0,0.12229116895479313,0.0,0.08651793020445081,0.0,0.07267134438611748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666211887523498,0.1131041228429521,0.0,0.04250137758932744,0.0,0.046633662963735154,

490215,B000003K9E,A16DCHMZZ9V22N,1,2,1058054400,The 1995 Pilot.,"Days before this episode aired on UPN, Robert Picardo hosted a special, to tell the audience, what Star Trek: Voyager is about.In late 2371, a renegade group known as the Maquis operate outside the law to right what they see as Federation injustices. After infiltrating a Maquis cell to apprise Starfleet of the group's activities, Lieutenant Tuvok, along with the crew of a ship commanded by the Maquis captain Chakotay, disappear in an area of space known as the Badlands. Tuvok's commanding officer, Captain Janeway, leads a mission to find the Vulcan lieutenant, enlisting the aid of Starfleet prisoner Tom Paris, a former Maquis member, to guide her ship, the U.S.S. Voyager NCC-74656, through the Badlands.Considered a traitor by most of Voyager's crew, Paris strikes up a friendship with Ensign Harry Kim, a naive young Starfleet Academy grad. Kim learns that Paris was drummed out of Starfleet after his piloting error caused the deaths of three officers. The outcast joined the ranks of the Maquis, but was soon arrested by Federation authorities.After reaching the Badlands, the U.S.S. Voyager encounters an inexplicable phenomenon that sends the ship hurtling to the far side of the Delta Quadrant, located 70,000 light years from their former position. The catapult effect kills a number of crewmembers, including the Chief Medical Officer, who is replaced by an Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) that attends to the wounded. But the EMH has barely begun his work when the entire crew of Voyager is transported to what appears to be a pastoral farm, populated by friendly humans. But it's only an illusion; the farm is actually the interior of the Array, a huge space station, and the residents are holograms. The crew is imprisoned within a strange laboratory facility, alongside the missing Maquis.After being subjected to a painful examination, the crews of Voyager and the Maquis vessel are returned to their respective ships, docked outside the Array. But two crewpersons are missing: Harry Kim and B'Elanna Torres, the half-Klingon, half-human engineer from the Maquis vessel. Returning to the ""farm,"" Janeway confronts the only remaining inhabitant, an old man playing a banjo. But the man cares nothing about their dilemma and offers them no information about the missing officers.Noting that the Array is sending energy pulses toward the fifth planet of a neighboring system, Janeway sets course in that direction. Far beneath the surface of that planet, an ailing Kim and Torres regain consciousness in a medical facility. But what they're doing there &euro;"" and why &euro;"" they have yet to discover.En route to the fifth planet of a neighboring system, Voyager's crew encounters Neelix, a Talaxian scavenger. He explains that the Array has been bringing ships into the region for many months. Neelix guesses that the ""Caretaker,"" who controls the Array, may have sent the missing crewmembers to the Ocampa, a race that lives two miles below the surface of the fifth planet. Neelix volunteers to be their guide and they accept.Meanwhile, Kim and Torres are being cared for in the Ocampa medical facility. Although they now live in a subterranean society, the Ocampa inhabited the planet's surface until it was struck by an environmental disaster 500 years ago. Since that time, they have lived underground, with all their needs provided by the man they refer to as the Caretaker.Beaming down to the planet's surface, Neelix introduces Janeway to the Kazon, a savage alien species that has taken possession of the arid Ocampan world. Janeway asks Jabin, the Kazon leader, if he can help them, but he refuses.Neelix is hoping Jabin will trade Kes, an Ocampan woman he is holding captive, for some of Voyager's precious water. But the Kazon are more interested in obtaining all of Voyager's technology &euro;"" forcibly. When Jabin tries to take the crew hostage, Neelix helps them escape and beam back to the ship, along with Kes.Kim and Torres persuade an Ocampan nurse to show them a route that could lead to the surface. On Voyager, Kes agrees to lead Janeway and the others through the tunnels to her underground city to search for the pair.As the Array increases the rate of the energy pulses that power the city, Kim and Torres begin their journey, narrowly missing the search party from Voyager. Tuvok theorizes that the increased activity of the Array may indicate that the Caretaker is dying; he is clearly attempting to give them a surplus of power that will sustain the Ocampa after he is gone.The search is complicated by a new turn of events. The Array is now firing a weapon at the planet to seal up all of the energy conduits, the tunnels that provide the only access to the city. This will protect the Ocampans, but prevent the others from escaping. Splitting up, Paris, Neelix and Kes find Kim and Torres, and send them up to Voyager. Then Paris and Neelix go back for Janeway, Tuvok and Chakotay. Chakotay's skepticism towards Paris' loyalty is erased when Paris saves his life.Returning to the Array, Janeway again encounters the old man, whom she realizes is the Caretaker. He explains that he was bringing beings from across the galaxy to the Array in the hopes of finding a compatible species with which he could procreate, thus providing the Ocampa with someone to care for them after he dies. But no species has been a match so far.Janeway tries to convince the Caretaker to send Voyager and the Maquis ship back home, but he refuses. Apparently, the Caretaker wants to destroy the Array so that it won't fall into the invading Kazon's hands. But he dies before he can carry out his plan, and Janeway is left to decide whether to use the Array to get home &euro;"" which would leave it intact for the Kazon &euro;"" or to destroy it and save the Ocampa. She chooses what seems to be the only moral option and makes a mortal enemy of the Kazon, even it meant violating the Prime Directive.With Chakotay's ship destroyed in the battle with the Kazon, Janeway asks the Maquis to become part of Voyager's crew. She also allows Neelix and Kes to stay aboard. With Chakotay her First Officer, Tom Paris reinstated as a Starfleet lieutenant, and Torres and Kim cured by the Emergency Medical Hologram, Janeway and her new crew set course for the long trip home, 70,000 light-years away.",0.5,1062,0.04244074547606559,0.10687031149736861,0.036004067129970854,0.01646749031160899,0.11713288426792814,0.1790976145100842,0.05783024853049105,0.06536241718578552,0.012904073543826281,0.0367424318599312,0.0,0.033274207635018434,0.0,0.12075001241577726,0.12138513222949363,0.028665260168573813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0158664069880848,0.0,0.016093482000311618,0.07813029565016975,0.06543338429169028,0.016001634625224952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05547813951349203,0.03442018607997568,0.18551717487587005,0.06892702005634144,0.0,0.05545245020973028,0.0,0.013380746620507096,0.0789791005141413,0.033631474525666886,0.12914400782336447,0.047103771674061316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017683055311824857,0.0,0.014196882964739706,0.016991179154136046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03213524990413042,0.0,0.2190016789987706,0.02160116617066299,0.0,0.06378873246416494,0.014357639427042806,0.0,0.027998845813446093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015393104224045755,0.0,0.05496181719642027,0.018686050948636117,0.02584329933370069,0.014471468661797701,0.0,0.0,0.18319206688059997,0.7406054386370565,0.09780331796279554,0.12018727738743025,0.017616162800398787,0.013741097954473798,0.09496342185615796,0.015163569142423908,0.01466310984186967,0.33616011944332774,0.0,0.035736819352773654,0.05918518308770936,0.0,0.041872030362331274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069425360865154,0.043797121839487876,0.03224261643362208,0.027369466968254538,0.045314060808795555,0.09256214704802929,0.015374981295428358,0.0,

1337019,B003D63G5E,AQE41QO3NEUMW,7,7,1269648000,Assumed identity . . .,"Shot in 40 days, using courtroom footage and reenactments with people playing themselves, this ""new wave"" film by Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami is an absorbing journey into the nature of identity. What does an ordinary man become when he is assumed to be someone famous? The answer can be poignant, as it is in this film, and surprisingly complex.Moved by director Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film ""The Cyclist,"" a divorced and unemployed printer's assistant pretends for a moment to a fellow bus passenger that he is the director himself. Suddenly becoming the object of respect and admiration, he allows himself to be drawn into a ruse involving an entire family, who believe that he wants to make a movie about them.Legally, he admits in court, he is guilty of fraud. But morally, he argues, he has not done and never intended any harm. He has the heart and soul of an artist, which the limited circumstances of his life have never permitted him to be. Respected and admired, taken seriously maybe for the first time in his life, he is lifted out of his suffering. How this is all played out before the cameras makes for a fascinating study of art, imagination, and self. This film is both wise and touching and a worthy addition to the Criterion collection.",1.0,217,0.05780971880401108,0.0,0.04904214035915434,0.0,0.21273327557517205,0.2927446052276165,0.0,0.04451598240647834,0.0,0.20019154990536414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04111923686209512,0.11022804119737707,0.05856862118704801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21879302370065765,0.065764137169087,0.11972637773710795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11335247328018849,0.04688469196629187,0.5831494598258418,0.0,0.07560611872192394,0.1699499776625743,0.07027919380345485,0.0,0.143439503426916,0.1374310981216983,0.26386596278222857,0.03208067818485294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04270125588306912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04624427858194608,0.22373120462148327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11441401783752778,0.07432597742858651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07879926475098858,0.27765116937868856,0.0,0.07016161304072421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12392831346702862,0.05991908817168556,0.1916761563997926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05777676442295783,0.059657276741137084,0.06587784575736697,0.055921067296382306,0.0,0.042027157571645254,0.0,0.0,

310475,6302390486,A1PNAQB2L490AN,4,8,1105574400,simply put: a classic!,"I've read many reviews of Naked Lunch the movie, and people either love it or hate it. I personnally can't get enough of it. All the elements of this movie are excellent: the costumes, the acting, the dialogues (or most of the time, the monologues), the special effects... My only disappointment is they shot it in a studio instead of in Tangiers where it is supposed to take place. I understand it is a low budget movie so I'll just say, the movie could have been even greater if it was shot on location. The filming and lighting are very straight forward, put the colors in black and white and you could almost say it's from the 40's. The costumes reflect the 50's era. The music is produced by Ornette Coleman; it is a mix of sax-driven avant-garde jazz and oboe-driven traditional music from northern Morocco. But really, what I like about this movie are the dialogues. Peter Weller's Robocop face spits out line after line with almost no facial expressions. Which fits perfectly with the character he is playing.I could go on and on about the little things that make this movie great, but i'll stop here.The only real problem is the price of the DVD! which is pricier than what most of us pay for a mainstream movie.",0.5,220,0.1179605583613508,0.07425930833136814,0.050035170380384145,0.0,0.0,0.17920334748727504,0.1446609737242138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936219076085422,0.0,0.08390367986548368,0.05622999711693116,0.05975454820236267,0.0,0.0,0.0693368950516086,0.0661490581695277,0.0,0.0,0.04071688596264008,0.10912002312787128,0.06671283929792238,0.0,0.05642701704799806,0.0,0.0,0.047834036883085435,0.05949573645426861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05578602560846552,0.10975795419026438,0.0,0.26920885403258055,0.29457237559942445,0.0,0.05754674978212776,0.05473971144733575,0.06797503887397048,0.0737228948756515,0.0,0.0,0.1416767512745469,0.30496124731571767,0.0,0.0,0.05807692364420967,0.06698796131969204,0.0,0.26087020231203895,0.13508699215511227,0.0,0.1329716481337348,0.11971763063304608,0.0,0.05836536532134063,0.07583096734956696,0.0,0.0649156384404517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05387199232319182,0.0,0.0,0.06681947762526692,0.04019741602620276,0.594873699951047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05655921722864621,0.09482825740066285,0.06113236012440718,0.03259288533319007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05961618739942967,0.04364244806959311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11789331504534932,0.0,0.13442354728497255,0.0,0.0,0.08575628935852514,0.0,0.04704706202241117,

394414,630398536X,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0,0,1357862400,A trip back to my youth when these movies could terrify,"When I was young the local television station had a ""Creature Feature"" that ran after the late local news on Saturday nights. The movies were grade B movies featuring poorly designed monsters, often questionable acting and lousy special effects. While I do not remember ever seeing this movie, it certainly satisfies the preconditions. I do remember often being frightened by the monsters and the threats they made to the humans opposing them.The premise is that some form of humanoid lizard creatures come out of the ground and alter the environment of a section of southern California so that they can live above the ground. They have also created a bubble of a protective wall that is keeping out the American military. A small group of people are trapped inside the bubble with the creatures roaming about.The group contains two male hero types, two young and beautiful females and an older male scientist that is the father of the women.  The monsters are armed only with spears; they are ugly, dirty and disgusting and make obscene noises as they function. The women regularly place their hands to their faces and scream, the scientist is smart enough to figure out what to do and the two heroes play the hero the way heroes were played in the fifties and sixties.The modern viewer will often find this movie dull and pathetic when compared to the modern gory monster movies with incredible special effects. Yet, to a boy that used to occasionally pull the covers over his head, watching this movie was a trip back to his youth and a tribute to his conquering his fear.",0.0,272,0.04933505669326275,0.06211546024235983,0.0,0.057427683633206945,0.045386867589798756,0.2997953699345625,0.12100412950105256,0.03799012624893644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04703453652919845,0.04998270717256557,0.17568707462997646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05584127050965966,0.0,0.040011592930334065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19338136577409054,0.0,0.0,0.030602968583931914,0.0,0.11259216012983246,0.027377785426941442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10932429304872683,0.17951324106266944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03946506145989156,0.19093314917295526,0.037665269979926905,0.0,0.0556131972449513,0.0,0.0,0.1464621046416531,0.06343010113322087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04506214335306999,0.05046688404193063,0.0,0.0,0.20174286993458132,0.639761418273916,0.1136910339900803,0.05987621508400631,0.0,0.0,0.23654959142818616,0.07932070719186855,0.0,0.24536585469624383,0.0,0.1869394835230023,0.0,0.0,0.07301093449051035,0.0,0.061326048274317015,0.0,0.0,0.11589746938002979,0.0493069332861404,0.10182354078447625,0.0,0.0,0.052675129381613534,0.10759845806289979,0.0,0.0,

The concept behind having a ""school"" that is supposed to teach confidence but really conveys sinister ways in order to reach that confidence was good.  I do not recommend the unrated version though.  The only reason it is unrated is because Billy Bob says G## D##### about a million times.  After a while the curse words get to the point where they are weakening the film and not strengthening it.  Then again its just B grade comedy, despite having Ben Stiller in the mix.

This is light entertainment.  I think it was a tv movie.  Don't expect a silver screen quality horror movie.  But Kathleen Beller as the pretty, terrified girl stalked by someone who leaves her threatening notes in her locker is believable and entertaining.  Sadly, although she is surrounded by friends, family and school officials, she is totally alone in her fear and quite unprepared to deal with it.  You want to shake her and tell her to smart up, but I suspect that her way of dealing with it is probably closer to the way most teens her age would deal with it.  I watch this movie at least once a year and always like it, although I couldn't tell you why.

There were a couple nice pop out shots, but the depth was kind of all over the place. There was a little more ghosting, than most movies. Overall I am glad I decided to check this one out in 3D. It does actually add to the movie, just wished it could have been done a little better.As far a the movie goes, I really did enjoy it. The acting was really good, and the dialog pretty believable. This movie wasn't as good a the original, but let's be real what remake has been, but if you just watch it a its own movie and not compare it to the original, this movie is really pretty good, and worth checking out!",0.0,143,0.0,0.0,0.06950254870354063,0.0,0.0,0.12446334540168527,0.0,0.12617615025094184,0.0,0.07092789407965583,0.0,0.19269841612972774,0.0,0.23309682177252092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751839884222832,0.0,0.05655876312923179,0.0,0.0,0.22771772053404368,0.07838129601156546,0.0,0.08032159421598842,0.06644501163639446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749091153988334,0.05082063608934634,0.0,0.18697549490267307,0.27278853023010297,0.10476508773288536,0.1598733750302498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221734056877532,0.09839973793193074,0.3025812184154984,0.09936919542346888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19661225229142285,0.09059199660786577,0.0,0.06679844239616707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2432214149571528,0.0,0.0,0.2705178550224988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09281719164118098,0.0,0.4328361315210971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15915557423665608,0.0,0.17563127505062118,0.0,0.1358217779436429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18186775518732728,0.09622054076366048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09623221843470423,0.08188126280442919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06535184540618774,

761654,B0000A59W5,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,7,7,1300233600,Stretchie Band gives a nice boost to these workouts,"""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" features two walking exercise programs: a one-mile ""Easy Walk"" and a two-mile ""Brisk Walk"". Both walks are led by Leslie Sansone and she has a group of walkers with her. Each walk incorporates the Stretchie Band (although you can do the exercises without the band).""Easy Walk""The ""Easy Walk"" is a very quick (approximately 18 minutes) but very effective exercise routine.  It features all of Leslie's regular moves: the four basic steps (walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts) as well as kick backs (hamstring curls).  You exercise at a pace of nine minutes for each half-mile. The Stretchie Band adds just the right bit of intensity to make this a challenging walk when you are short on time. You start using the Stretchie Band about 13 minutes in and you use it for about three minutes - it sort of serves as the cool down period. You use the Stretchie Band twice both in front of you and around your waist.  Finally, there is a nice stretch sequence at the end (about two minutes).""Brisk Walk""The ""Brisk Walk"" is a two-mile walk that takes about 32 minutes from start to finish - each mile is about 15 minutes long.  Again, Leslie uses her four basic steps and kick backs, but adds some upper body moves (reach your hands over your head and pull them down again) and some movement - (walk forward and back while doing knee lifts) and balance and coordination (put one hand out while kicking with the opposite leg) that aren't included in the one mile walk. While this is a nice invigorating workout, Leslie does not incorporate some of the vigorous routines she does in other two-mile walks. For example, she only does single side steps no double side steps and only single knee lifts rather than double or even four knee lifts at a time.  The Stretchie Band does add a nice bit of intensity to the workout. You use it about 21 minutes in and use it for about six minutes (with some breaks in between). Again you use it twice in front of you and twice around your waist. It is a nice segment and I could definitely feel the results afterwards.""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" is a nice workout DVD by Leslie Sansone and the Stretchie Band adds a nice boost to both the one-mile and two-mile walks.",1.0,402,0.29584031062034927,0.0,0.03585319546732467,0.0,0.0,0.363828130457224,0.06910549956491005,0.09763278317082255,0.11565000211761355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060122010413386426,0.08058431948703029,0.04281771163111475,0.050167474074909776,0.0,0.049684036898119455,0.04739976089821197,0.0,0.0,0.11670434697363329,0.03909551510327565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04143424768430491,0.0,0.0,0.10295728177621934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2097283893581632,0.0,0.1687912301050142,0.1641723570961194,0.0,0.04123569186958786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0480008852352001,0.03380776505881927,0.21029525970408097,0.03226597276815355,0.1378330813368058,0.09528214765548498,0.042892425261474874,0.049125041426614974,0.04182227891859479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641945145865706,0.0,0.0,0.17292992797431758,0.0,0.04788015658006897,0.05760771086067208,0.4465608446947786,0.0,0.05129299023716707,0.0,0.041050551521216685,0.0,0.04530008288922362,0.08760999274136687,0.09341901544942766,0.0,0.3202836081015972,0.0,0.0854371356627326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04457768426890494,0.0,0.0,0.04361359411282333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09217427406210175,0.0,0.33712036913821425,

When a gang of Russians come in they tell him he owes them 8 million dollars and won't let him go until they are repaid. When he realizes he isn't alone he is forced to make life and death decisions with every move he makes. This is a movie that although the idea has been done over and over still had potential. What it turned out to be was basically a version of the original Saw (without the gruesome chopping people up aspect). Man wakes up alone with no idea how he got there and must figure out who put him there and why. He sees someone else with him and must decide what to do next. The main difference is that this one has people coming in and out and more things happen but that is still the best way to describe it.

19230,0767827813,A37JV60F2B355W,4,4,1077926400,Charming and relaxed,"This is one of my favorite movies. James Garner and Sally Field are just great, the writing is very good (Garner's lines are wonderfully written and delivered), the pacing is relaxed but not slow, and the theme music by Carole King is as good as you'd expect (see if you can spot King in a cameo). What makes it all work, however, is the excellent supporting cast. Everyone is a fully realized individual, the town feels like a real community, and there's not a bad actor in the bunch. If you want a love story that's about love and not hormones, buy this DVD.

Death by Water Torture.,"Just Death.I went into this expecting mystery, atmosphere, surreptious class warfare, guerrillas manning the barricades between Upstairs and Downstairs---something to enthrall while I immersed myself in the rich, ribald atmosphere of Edwardian England.You know what I got? Sheer, ruthless boredom.This is perhaps the stupidest, most pretentious, most godawful piece of rubbish every vomited out by director Robert Altman, who once upon a time could work a camera (when you need to pay rent, you better be good), but now realizes that his white, middle-class liberal audience would happily eat a turd if he offered it to them on a silver platter, handsomely mounted.Altman makes a point of criticizing George W. Bush. But at least, in the field he's in, Bush delivers to his audience. Altman throws talented actors like Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith, and Michael Gambon---and a lotta gorgeous English scenery, including a stately manor home, all of whom/which deserve better---into a cinematic blender, and his ""puree"".""Gosford Park"" is ""Clue"" for middle class, pretentious, bourgeois morons.

To put it simply, this movie is hilarious for pretty much the whole 80-or-so minute run. Any fan of Billy and Mandy will love it, anyone who only watches the show occasionally will love it, and anyone who has never seen the show will probably love it as well(my grandma did).The only Billy and Mandy episode that can possibly compare with this is the episode where they try to get Mandy to smile, which is simply genius. A couple months ago, another TV-movie was made, Wrath of the Spider Queen. It was great, but definitely not as great as this.This is the ultimate Billy and Mandy experience. any fan who hasn't seen this, go out and buy this DVD.",1.0,133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21813439895852488,0.0,0.19902263391809288,0.0,0.07458491571728305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061278806566374175,0.0,0.0872831181331776,0.0,0.0,0.10127999598092517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059474916544540374,0.0,0.09744705313009155,0.07981959337600511,0.16484522578010233,0.0,0.08446295230687859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24576987145655904,0.2868534276938239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29787222194625423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1909093309422752,0.0,0.0974692654426542,0.08483262177938543,0.0,0.06891650765622225,0.0952628936659224,0.0,0.0,0.19423090662680628,0.08743542049536508,0.0,0.0852539468456263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.227589323494848,0.07869050325827531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058716129854778414,0.289642841642274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.082615716918646,0.32320185210140007,0.0,0.19043294587075182,0.10615341571135692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274965359148594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09087079000548222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817584360123345,0.2500126359834589,0.27595441307064733,0.0626318544773731,0.0,0.0,
1559242,B008JFUO72,ACHI4VJFUIBTW,14,45,1370736000,The studio became lazy with this one,"The first Iron Man movie was a pleasant surprise to me, most of the movie tried to be realistic in the context of the kind of superhero that Iron Man is, this is something that i guess we all owe to the last Batman trilogy. Unfortunately this third Iron Man movie broke with that new standard and depicts situations on which i was like ""no way, that's silly!"".SPOILER ALERT, where can I start? Let's be realistic, the superpowers that Killian and his sidekicks develop from just an injection are plain ridiculous (FIREBREATHING? REALLY???), COMMON!! they could have come with something smarter than that! Now the whole smart-suit-parts-that-seek-for-Tony thing is also over the roof. I also hated that in order to try to give a spectacular twist to the movie they wasted Ben Kingsley's ""Mandarin"" character, he could have been a super sinister Joker-like villain... sometimes simpler is better, I am actually surprised that such an excellent actor as Kingsley agreed to that degrading roll. How about a deeper development of Iron Patriot's character with interaction between him and Iron Man? maybe some conflict between them, that could have worked. And, what happened with the Iron Man suit's strength? it seemed like Tony Stark in a move to cut costs outsourced the manufacturing of the armour to China, as easy as the armour was destroyed in several parts of the movie even me myself could have defeated Iron Man just with a can opener. It is also unfortunate that the suits are already autonomous and do not need an actual human inside of them, with this what's the point on Tony Stark risking his life inside an armour? he could retire to Bali and control his suit army from a beach bench with a pina colada in one hand, they took away the human component to Iron Man and that breaks with the essence of Iron Man.Beneath the good things were the great special effects and of course Robert Downey's excellent Tony Stark characterization. Unfortunately since the first Iron Man movie was such a good movie the studio knows that we are going to see the new ones no matter if the plot is garbage.",0.3111111111111111,364,0.042478657090140176,0.0,0.03603622896602806,0.1483398040283911,0.15631668950780345,0.1720872954613238,0.10418743319835008,0.09813120652358037,0.0,0.07355050652991252,0.0,0.04995589639929329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08607259911024888,0.05042358313803111,0.0,0.0,0.04764174055893177,0.0,0.09664714824527941,0.02932503305532037,0.07859020181843651,0.0,0.07871258507645443,0.04063975181363248,0.0,0.0,0.1378037322454353,0.08569979736529582,0.0,0.05555547505763333,0.12487946616866392,0.051641243650908844,0.04017809825865,0.13174941872466747,0.0,0.1454167912767326,0.047145848692104544,0.0,0.08289240690634218,0.11827357198470803,0.0,0.0,0.09678077232523168,0.0,0.05101907127805191,0.21963857123874433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09649186736976673,0.03398035646779696,0.21136883422491987,0.06486138640247513,0.034634182625876656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04675340950239111,0.04622056388628577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04345318735425298,0.0,0.048124588700081905,0.4053126205928052,0.4896442629530481,0.0,0.10310969030491947,0.0,0.0,0.12220489427911682,0.06829701528266277,0.0,0.28168778151876883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572830185787987,0.0,0.05280318600898342,0.10275338911631975,0.0,0.049895238694249035,0.08490888433556429,0.0,0.04840712734223111,0.0,0.0,0.24705288341037054,0.0,0.0,

The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-ray&#8217;s have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too! Oh and just so you know, even if you don't own a Bluray movie you should go buy an on sale Bluray player. Why? Because a Bluray player scans the disk many more times than just a standard DVD player, that it will even make your older DVD movies look much better. That is, as long as you have a flat screen type of TV that was purchased in the last five years.

The characters are the same as we've come to expect, just the outfits & the venue have changed. It's the old west. A brillant move by Warner Bros. to squeeze another gangster like role out of Cagney. He had the clout to say no. He was sick of the gangster genre'. Bogie didn't have that type of power & had do what the studio told him. On a personal level the two men didn't really care for each other. So much the better for their roles. This was the second of three movies they made together. It was fun for Cagney. He rode & owned horses as a hobby in upstate NY. Bogart prefered sailing off Catalina Island in California. Whip is a psycho, a hardened criminal intent on taking over Tulsa. The kid is a bad guy going straight. His father, a judge has been killed, hung by Whip's gang & a frenzied mob. The kid swears revenge on the whole gang, since the law failed his father. He also has time to steal his brother's girlfriend. I guess that's ok because she loves him.

1032235,B000K7VHPU,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,3,4,1156291200,Come see Eisenheim the Great,"Everybody in everyday life uses magic. We all use our brain power to make things disappear and reappear. We use sleight of hand and misdirection. We use this magic to get ahead, stay ahead, cheat, make a move, enhance our PR, etc. The lesson we can learn from this excellent film is that to understand our magical powers is to be all powerful. ""The Illusionist"" tells the story of a magician (by trade) Eisenheim who becomes embroiled in a blood feud with Crown Price Leopold over a girl.  What ensues is a battle of illusions between the two. One has the cops do all his dirty work, makes Eisenheim's show go up in a puff of smoke, and makes his girlfriend disappear. The other is forced to counter those moves using more traditional magic.Edward Norton stars in his second quality film this year (after ""Down in the Valley"") and this time is playing a role better suited to his skills.  He nails the role of Eisenheim, even if he never disappears into it. The magic scenes are wonderful. Whether movie magic was used or not, I still found myself trying to figure out how he did that. It left me yearning to learn more about the history of magic, back before audiences were desensitized to magic by Hollywood. I also appreciated the way the film reminds us that the church and magic don't get along so well (remember the Harry Potter book burnings?). The reason, of course, being that magic delivers miracles whereas preachers are left discussing them. So the church has decided to disqualify magicians from the whole miracle making game (""Heretics!), talk about your sore losers. The first half of the film worked better than the second half. I enjoyed watching Eisenheim dance around his haters in Vienna, using simple magic and showmanship to drive them insane. Once the consequence of that insanity comes to bear, the story slows down in the extremist. The problem is that director Neil Burger thinks he has a real rabbit up his hat, but the ending is so very inevitable (it's called ""The Illusionist"" after all). It does all come together in a nice little bow, but they weren't fooling me. Paul Giamatti is stellar as always, but this isn't a sexy role like he had in ""Sideways"" and ""American Splendor."" Here he tones it down and remains hidden behind his beard.Eisenheim's success relies on the fact that he understands his power better than Leopold. To create a worthwhile illusion takes hard work and confidence. Leopold believed that his power was absolute, but no power is ever absolute (don't tell George Bush I said that). Illusions are just that and are far from real. It took an understanding in the human game of chess to make one person rise from the grave, another shape shift, and another fall to his knees, not magic. In other words, perception is reality. Burger thinks this movie is a magic trick, but I'm not buying it. I think he has a well made, well acted film that entertained me greatly. If he has been exposed as a phony magician, he still has me believing that he is a real film talent. ***1/2",0.75,536,0.06271702729758527,0.07896407294803322,0.13301298290624453,0.036502376235768894,0.028848952493146944,0.17467719057308476,0.10255073236896906,0.048294822073623594,0.0,0.027148157697165356,0.0,0.03687834706616758,0.0,0.11152434028778568,0.05979249866421756,0.03177017541136314,0.03722360188316774,0.07681152958967459,0.0,0.03516999533199155,0.1780243226032169,0.03567333721185297,0.0,0.11603341937835618,0.07093949064788581,0.0,0.0,0.035494015023240386,0.18446198082360654,0.0,0.34795828004204876,0.0,0.0,0.30729427533409054,0.038122500916902384,0.05932039894542014,0.21397157307417047,0.03727431178854666,0.21469861555832914,0.1218137164259488,0.0,0.03059633768362646,0.029103897309368274,0.0,0.0,0.14289063627700735,0.06293854783552298,0.0,0.046326048392295614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03561602163518787,0.07525474285769614,0.1733736664484472,0.023940924809199488,0.051135161183822914,0.0,0.03182561193638369,0.07290026130587988,0.031031577511516785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04142011011884526,0.08592765056500284,0.0,0.06704693586405909,0.07105288514143422,0.2564649547166366,0.4367693128008454,0.0,0.07611743996257601,0.0,0.0,0.03007128840466129,0.10083618610487068,0.032502727623104084,0.2599337745867898,0.0,0.039607699801257515,0.06559590380106156,0.031696612023947815,0.0464074542361767,0.0,0.038980267800103816,0.15170882395016788,0.09922815545515888,0.03683356845022644,0.031340637754748775,0.0,0.0,0.030334026671428534,0.0,0.022797363861921334,0.0,0.0,

As Dick, he takes all he can and then gets pushed over the proverbial edge, to great comic effect.But it's Leoni's character Jane, her hyperventilating neuroses, and her gradual warming to husband Dick's life of crime that warms this reviewer's heart.Baldwin makes hay with his limited screentime as the ultimate Corporate Bad Guy, humbled in the end by Dick and Jane's Robin Hood turn.I sat down to this movie with low expectations, all of which were exceeded by a very funny provocation to mindless laughter.

On a flat screen, all the visual tricks used to enhance a 3D experience seem a bit contrived, but like the effects in The Polar Express, the story still takes center stage.  In some ways, Robert Zemeckis misses the point of this Christmas story and in an effort to make this film an ""experience"" for 3D theater viewers, especially children, he sacrifices story and character for cheap amusement park thrill ride.  In A Christmas Carol, the story still comes through and many elements of the original story appear that are often not included in other film versions of this story.  Unlike the Polar Express, the music in this film is nowhere near as memorable.",0.0,133,0.0,0.0,0.07685103038180566,0.0,0.16668085145469058,0.18349708545098414,0.07406353572379427,0.06975835661621162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06443551807125951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10649732553484575,0.0,0.25714318117960766,0.0,0.12507740520832197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138189427705902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33716331164639,0.0,0.051686088163147,0.05027172867655762,0.0,0.0,0.08407692420249487,0.0,0.11323395905022318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246666707976251,0.15025538804388178,0.13832369590396865,0.07386101980147408,0.0,0.0,0.10529912332709458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266847051882472,0.5810665236408906,0.0,0.06174082783798992,0.3915816166970013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24275089019546564,0.0,0.2002428933032019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10956617902855675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
652266,B00005JPL5,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,2,5,1173052800,Reality Check,"As a movie about the lost powers of the imagination, ""Terabithia"" is a mixed blessing.  Kids today have a lot of digital and electronic crutches on which to prop up their creative spirit; it's nice for a story to encourage the limitless scope of the human mind.  Fifteen year old Jesse Aarons, an aspiring artist, has a home life that offers little in the way of dream nourishment, so it is no surprise when he quickly befriends the New Girl In School, Leslie Burke, a young naif with a spirit as wholesome and wide-eyed as her cute little face.Jesse and Leslie soon discover their own little paradise in the woods behind their house.  They call this land Terabithia and dress it up with their ""wide open"" minds.  Disney helps the jaded viewer out by giving us sometimes rich, sometimes ambivalent CGI depictions of their pretend world, but they are rare.  This is just as well; the movie wants us to rediscover the wonder of our own minds, but it leaves very little of the story up to our own imaginations.I have to wonder if the emotion of the film (and it wants to have so much emotion) wouldn't have more impact if there was more humanity to back it up.  It shows us a world of heartless bullies (some misunderstood and hurting; some just plain malicious), pesky but endearing little sisters, and happy vs. struggling homes, and then balances this out with brief moments of care-free, play-land giddiness.  It can't have both, at least not in equal measure.  It sacrifices some of its heart and soul for the kindling flash of its fantasy world, and vice versa.By the time Jesse's absurdly hot music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, offers (out of the blue!) to take him (alone!) to a museum, it's hard to figure out just what is real and what isn't (this movie's world must exist before things like permission slips were invented).  At any rate, this becomes the marker for the movie's last bit of credibility, where Jesse and Leslie's world runs headlong into harsh reality.  What follows are a series of events that pretend to be saturated with import, but which are instead progressively longer and more maudlin.  By the time all was said and done, this reviewer felt cheated.  The flick pretended to be magical, but I could see the rabbits hiding in its hat.",0.4,397,0.04172247133124218,0.0,0.0353947283863211,0.0,0.038383502700805906,0.2957917822875244,0.10233273583648324,0.1285124258108313,0.07611409730663052,0.07224119382071757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14838302422449118,0.11933079032130102,0.04227018689835669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03947686413150784,0.0,0.08640900641058583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04090441377851778,0.1691882659963749,0.042087104249545135,0.05082036588878606,0.05456650172501951,0.0,0.0,0.07892573200622449,0.12940407541564353,0.049593434893215924,0.095218765073013,0.2315328985411815,0.16005737460757366,0.12212519089487452,0.03872270652612027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12560951327800224,0.0,0.1232735229472019,0.0,0.04720321816207483,0.0,0.047387081487653374,0.0333754535964868,0.34601023707637635,0.031853376731511916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16514993249845278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045397766402248615,0.05644384825040596,0.0,0.0,0.0762177692776235,0.12803896035073073,0.08920588171893608,0.0,0.05687106134596816,0.4208118584160507,0.24037019637793278,0.0,0.051954071906250794,0.04052562406958491,0.08001963883931101,0.13416244567682978,0.08648969378013525,0.27667330358016406,0.0,0.0,0.1745505699943839,0.04217231088430705,0.06174507186820585,0.0,0.0518632076758712,0.0,0.0440076541636863,0.049007026318388276,0.12509606241579924,0.04305589215838517,0.09509081129746053,0.0,0.0,0.12132748009802828,0.0,0.0,

This film is much, much better than any other action movie put out last year. It really makes every other film I saw last year look hollow and boring.Aspects of the film that I enjoyed were the uncertainty of which reality was being experienced at different times, the nature of the lead character's strong, yet easily-manipulated personality, and the many questions that are left up to the viewer to answer for him or herself. I believe the characteristic of this movie that is most engaging is the subtlety with which aspects of the plot unfold. Subtlety is in very short supply in modern movies, and I was happy to see that it played a very large part in Memento.The actors gave excellent performances. Solid, two-sides-to-each-decision roles that make you empathize with them, and yet sometimes you are reviled by them.The best film of the year last year, and I applaud them for making it.",0.0,183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20478063761446785,0.11020540576779801,0.0,0.061477284686277965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08103082551011959,0.0,0.06425557794606768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826251116069358,0.0,0.0930566307607293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08814662407067851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542345975952207,0.0,0.15381621368475457,0.11220534241255749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424519759873524,0.0,0.0,0.08094897742690947,0.09956790834653127,0.08174650589851126,0.15250397935445612,0.06636611213634012,0.0,0.0,0.26084066633791214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13680465838658154,0.15668348128197307,0.06669572244432646,0.0,0.0,0.07418090129108726,0.07333546630629376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635647115430955,0.27560821602010577,0.45318578878557014,0.0,0.24539717552382864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224192065108431,0.0,0.1862239722028585,0.0,0.08512825851739159,0.07049216546881407,0.20437521462034688,0.1994857455077884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916585797414476,0.0,0.0,0.15360951739682163,0.0,0.0,0.09799609137065131,0.0,0.10752396642055913,

Battle 360 is high energy story telling all the way. The historic place that the 'Big E' has in American history is recounted accurately, skillfully and suspensefully. This is done in three ways. First, computer generated graphics show us how battles actually unfolded, how close or how far away Japanese warships lurked, how chaotic and deadly the skies over the Big E's decks were. Secondly, we see real footage from the vantage point of our fighter planes and from the deck of the carrier or it's support ships as enemy planes try to send it to the bottom of the Pacific.Lastly, and most importantly, real sailors and pilots who were on the Enterprise are interviewed. From there own heroic perspective they relate gripping tales of courage under fire. One thing I noticed - despite the fact that there all genuine  certified, 100% grade A heroes they'll mostly talk about the actions of others, not themselves. They'll mention the bravery of a fellow pilot or sailor who performed a selfless act. Each episode breaks down key battles that Enterprise was involved in. One in particular got me hooked - ""Enterprise vs Japan."" Much has been written about the later battles in WW II, like Iwo Jima. But between the time the Navy got hammered at Pearl Harbor and the time we got our arsenal of democracy up to full production it really was Enterprise and her support ships vs Japan. Wow!

158722,0793906091,A2VWPJGE6YSGAN,20,24,1144281600,Star Wars Special Edition Version 2.0: Glitches Marr an Otherwise Awesome Set,"**Update: There is little point in buying this set, now that the 2006 ""Limited Edition"" sets are out... all you get with this package is the ""Bonus Materials"" disc (which can be ordered separately here on Amazon most of the time, or Ebay) and a cheap, flimsy cardboard box to put the three packages in. If you can't stand the Special Editions, avoid this set and get the 2006 sets instead. Although those sets are ""Limited Edition"" they are still being sold as of this writing**First off, yes, I am a Star Wars fan, and yes I own these films on DVD, VHS, and watch them regularly. This is NOT a rambling denunciation of the Special Editions or a rant against George Lucas, so please bear with me if you are an honest customer seeking real info, let me explain myself:Of the official DVD sets that exist currently, this is the one to get. Why? It includes a fourth, bonus disc, that is great for the 3.5 hour documentary ""Empire of Dreams"" and the smaller mini behind the scenes specials. The ""Episode III Teaser"" is fluff, as are many of the other ""bonus features"" which include the space filler Star Wars Battlefront II trailer and Xbox only 1 level demo.. an overhyped and sadly buggy game, and a fluff video for the overhyped Episode III:Revenge of the Sith console game). The screenshot galleries are nice, but everyone who wanted to see deleted scenes was disappointed, though many little hints can be found in the nice trailers section).In 1997 George Lucas released the Star Wars Trilogy on the big screen again after 11 years (since the last re-release of Return of the Jedi). Many fans were upset over the Special Edition changes like Greedo suddenly taking a wild shot at Han Solo, some CGI Banthas wandering around for no reason, Jabba the Hutt's new musical theater, flute music replacing the Ewok song, a poorly done Jabba the Hutt scene with redundant dialouge and many other goofs as well as nice things like pretty new skylines on Cloud City and enhanced CGI space combat around the Death Star.Seven years later, Lucas decided to release the films on DVD, but he would not just release them as the 1997 Special Editions, but as a ""new"" set that was supposedly even closer to his ""original vision"" and what he ""always intended"" the movies to be.But that is NOT what I'm going to get into with this review. That debate has been beaten to DEATH, and the most serious fans have already encoded their Laser Disc versions of the ORIGINAL original trilogy and made them into home-made DVDs, and even made fan edits of their own ""special edition"" to view alongside or instead of these new incarnations.Some will complain (as Roger Ebert does) that these movies have lost some of their ""film quality"" in the transfer process. It is well known among cinemaphiles that Films (that is, movies shown on celluloid) have natural imperfections in the medium, commonly known as ""film grain."" This ""gritty sand"" that is subtly noticable in movies is normal. Movies shot on Video tape (commmonly called ""video"" as opposed to ""film"") do not exhibit this texture. Likewise digital video such as movies shot entirely on digital ""tape"" like Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith do not have film grain. Perhaps in an effort to make the visual look of these movies more closely ""Match"" the prequels on DVD, the grain was mostly ""removed"" from this set. Some purist may criticize this. It is not my desire to do so in this review, but it is something worth noting. If film grain is something you can't live without, avoid this set.Rather (sorry to get through this long introduction but this is Star Wars, the product with the most replies, I might as well make this UNIQUE right?), here are the reasons this set FAILS to be the ULTIMATE HOME EDITION OF STAR WARS we've all dreamed of owning:1- The colors. Yes, Lowry Digital did a bang up job ""restoring"" the Trilogy so that they almost look like modern movies shot last week instead of movies shot 20 years ago. However, they used an automated process to save time and money and unfortunately this system was not quite perfect, so the color timing is way off in many scenes throughout the 6 hours of the Star Wars saga. You want examples? Sam Davatchi's page has well documented these but sadly his web page is down, but many thumbnails of his pics can be seen via google image search. But in any case, they exist, and here are some examples:- Blue Rebel Soldiers. In a few shots of the Rebel soldiers who try to hold off the Stormtroopers in Episode IV, their outfits look blue. They are actually supposed to be gray, but some shots the blue level is too high.- Weird lightsaber colors. This is most commonly noticed with regards to Darth Vader's lightsaber (which is supposed to be RED). Often times it turns pink or violet for no reason, and then will be red in the next shot. Too much blue, or not enough red. In a few shots in Episode V, Darth Vader's saber turns orange (when he leaps at Luke in their first fight in the ""carbon freeze chamber"" and when he puts his saber up to Luke in ""the cave"" on Yoda's Dagobah). Luke's lightsaber in Episode IV, while on the Falcon appears green in the far shot (compare this to the menu version of the same shot on the Bonus Disc, also compare to animated menu for that same scene in the ANH menus), when it should be blue. Luke's saber (the one Ben Kenobi says belonged to his father), is shown blue when he first swings it around in Ben's hut at the beginning of the movie. It's then bright green on the Falcon. Then it turns a blue/green color for the rest of the scene, except the last part of the ""wearing the helmet with the blast shield down"" training scene where Luke ""starts to get the hang of it"" when it is the proper blue color. In the original versions, the lightsaber was always blue, though the color faded over time to almost white in many of these shots. The automatic color balancing tool they used obviously decided green was the proper color and goofed up most of these shots. One can compare the lightsaber Luke uses in Episode V (storywise it's supposed to be the same one, and it's ALWAYS blue). Finally, in Episode IV, in the otherwise awesomely done ""enhanced"" lightsaber battle (the lightsabers are recolored to match the rest of the movies) between Vader and Kenobi, Vader's saber appears violet/pink in several shots, while red in a few others. There are one or two far shots (when the Stormtroopers are coming over to watch the fight) where Vader and/or Kenobi's sabers are still unpainted where Lowry Digital forgot to repaint them as they did all the other shots, so they appear as white sticks. In a quick shot where Kenobi's saber infamously ""shorts out"" as he's facing the camera and swinging at Vader, Lowry Digital added a glow, but forgot to color the white ""core"" of the saber, so it still appears to be a prop rod, rather than a fantasy energy blade.A final lightsaber note. This is just ""one scene"" and so it has been heavily critized by some fans as being unimportant. I could argue for dramatic and story purposes it is VERY IMPORTANT, and so to screw it up visually is unforgiveable here. In any case, in the scene in Episode VI, when Luke swings his lightsaber at the Emperor and Darth Vader ""blocks"" it with his own lightsaber, and the two blades ""cross"" in front of the Emperor's cackling face... something strange happens. In previous versions, Luke's green blade is blocked by Vader's red blade, and they merge into a ""white"" area. The Emperor's face is lit up, and what appear to be black ""slugs"" appear on his face (this was actually a last minute touch up during the original film to cover open areas of light reflection off the unmade-up portions of the actor's face and hood). Probably in an effort to remove the ""Emperor's slugs"" (the fan name for these odd black blobs that appear on his face) Lowry Digital's tool made the scene very very dark, much darker than normal. As a result, the lightsabers appear more ""solid"" and less white. In fact, so much so, that Vader's saber appears to be IN FRONT OF LUKE'S (that is, Luke's green blade is closer to the Emperor's face than Vader's). This would lead some to suspect that the story has been changed... Luke was not trying to attack the Emperor and Vader defending. Rather Luke was ""blocking"" Vader from killing his own master! Wow! And all this because they wanted to remove the slugs by making it too dark, rather than removing them digitally (cheap way out leads to a greater problem). Now on the user end one can ""fix"" this problem by upping the brightness of their display considerably, and the lightsabers appear correct. However this makes the rest of the movie too bright, and makes obvious ""garbage mattes"" (VFX artifacts that appear as light green, blue or gray ""boxes"" around starships as they were blue/green screened into composite shots) that would normally ""disappear"" in a properly darkened screen stand out like sore thumbs. One more visual glitch that detracts from an otherwise phenomenal experience.- Pink or Red? Like the Darth Vader lightsaber issue, this one is all over the map as well. When ""blasters"" or ""turbo lasers"" fire red shots (everybody fires red except for Imperial starships and starfighters which fire green), they are sometimes the proper red, and sometimes a more pink/violet color. This goes also for explosions which appear violet that were previously red/orange in other releases. But the blaster shots are the most obvious gaffe since they are supposed to be weapon that doesn't change color at random (just like Lightsabers).- Tammy Faye Leia. Look at Princess Leia's makeup job in the early scenes in Episode IV. Also look at her makeup when she dons ""forest gear"" for their mission to Endor in Episode VI. That makeup looks REALLY caked on. She's like a white ghost. Her skin is pasty and pale. She does not look this bad in the originals. Rather this is due to the color balancing goofing up with either too much white (light balance) or too much pink. In the shots in Episode IV, her face is often the only ""colored"" object in the room (everything else is either white, or black like Vader's armor). They mistimed this.- True Blue R2. This is primarily confined to Episode IV, but watch those shots of R2D2 wandering in the desert after the droids' ""escape pod"" lands. R2D2 is a frighteningly bright shade of blue. This is not correct. The original prop/costume (whatever you want to call that rig they forced Kenny Baker Jr. to ride around in for his part) is not bright plastic blue, but a kind of dark blue finish that appears almost black except when the light shines on it. The color timing obviously made a choice thinking this was ""wrong"" and upped the blue, making it now loud and painful on the eyes. The same can be see with the blue object attached to the escape pod noticable in the shots when the droids are first setting out into the sands. It is the same blue color as R2D2. Originally it was much darker in color (I assume this is supposed to be a ""parachute"" of the pod). Lowry made sure to fix a few ""space"" shots of R2D2 that originally showed him with Black decals (this was because the blue screen effect used sucked all the color out of R2D2 and they didn't have time to painstakingly put it back in the originals). But they neglected others. So as a result you will sometimes see the exterior of Luke's ship with R2D2 and he's bright blue. Other times, he's black (and not the dark blue he should be always).- Yoda. Yes, Yoda is made to appear VERY green in Episode V and VI. However at the expense of the rest of the scenes he's in. He was actually a bit more blue and even brown in the original movies. As a result, everything else in the scenes looks too green. They probably did this in the hopes of making him look as vibrantly green as he was in the Prequels. But it's not quite right, and jars with the otherwise drab blueish background of Dagobah. Much of Empire Strikes Back relies on the blue color scheme, which is now a bit more green than before.- Death Star explosion. Okay this one really bugs me. Take a look at the explosion of Alderaan in Episode IV. It's a big orange/red/yellowish fiery blast. Okay. Now compare the Death Star blowing up in the same movie. It's WHITE. Okay, some people said ""well the death star is a cold artificial thing, so maybe it just blows up white."" The trouble is in the earlier verisons of the movie the Death Star explosion was the same color scheme roughly as Alderaan. And now check the Death Star II explosion on this set, and what do you find? Nice red/orange/yellowish fiery explosion again! So this was another color timing error. And for those who still need proof, watch the Episode IV Death Star explosion closely. On the outer right edge of the explosion you'll see some obvious, bad blue screen artifacting (looks like blue glow). That wasn't there before! Lowry Digital screwed up again.2-Sound issues:Now this one 20th Century Fox actually commented on, and many of us smelled BS. Basically here is what they said:""Thanks for being so observant, the audience really is listening, these were DELIBERATE CREATIVE DECISIONS."" And then just turned away.Here are the issues, and I'll explain why their excuse is suspect (these are all relating to Episode IV):- In Episode IV, the stereo channels are reversed. Why is this a ""creative decision""? Isn't it rather, ""incorrect""? An object you see moving on your right, but sounds like it's moving on your left is a gaffe, isn't it?- When Govenor Tarkin is talking to Princess Leia on the Death Star, he says ""You prefer another target... then name the system! I grow tired of asking..."" notice in his speech that the vocal quality of those lines changes rapidly. Sometimes there is a noticable ""hiss"" behind his lines and other times not. The DVD authors forgot to balance the lines properly so they are all at the same vocal level. This was not part of earlier versions of Star Wars. Likewise notice that whenever Leia speaks in the parts of this conversation suddenly you hear a tape hiss in the background of her lines. It's very noticeable if you have your speakers turned up. Is this also a ""creative decision"" to make the lines sound more like artificial recordings than natural speech?Finally, the biggest complaint people had, which is most easily recognizable and puts the nail in the ""creative decision"" excuse's coffin, is that ""horns"" incident with the attack on the Death Star. This is often referred to as the famous ""Force fanfare"" (I think). When Red Leader is saying ""...wait for my signal to start your attack run"" and then you get a dramatic shot of the X-Wings looping around in formation to swing into the Death Star trench for the first time. You here a big ""DUN DUN DUH DUN DUN DUN!"" in the music. But in the regular audio tracks, this is completely drowned out by loud engine noise from the fighters, so it almost appears to be WITHOUT music (it's actually still there, just much quieter than before). Creative decision? At first glance, however if you switch from the English to the FRENCH sound track (which is available on Region 1 DVD's at least), suddenly you hear the proper ""horns"" playing during this same section.So is Fox saying that French people must hear the scene as it was for twenty years, but English and Spanish speakers must now get only loud engines? Something is fishy at Fox studios!One could go on and complain about the poor line delivery of Ian McDiarmond (compared to Clive Revil) in his new scene as the Emperor (his voice actually cracks when he says ""he could destroy us"") or the bored mechanical way that supposed villian Boba Fett delivers his lines in the redubbed by Teumora Morrison scenes also of Empire Strikes Back, but then certain fans could get the satisfaction that I'm complaining ONLY because Lucas keeps altering his movies, and I must just be upset about the Special Edition. So I won't. Rather, I comment on the actual GAFFES in this release, which were not in previous Special Editions, but are NEW, that we the purchasers of these DVD's get to experience for the first time, which should have been caught before release in testing.These color and sound issues issues are things you can't simply ignore when watching the films, so people buying this, even if they are devoted Lucasphiles who love every change he's ever made to Star Wars, need to consider this before they plunk down their change, thinking this will be the definitive home set of these classics.As a self-proclaimed ""visual filmmaker"" Lucas can't ignore these things, and really I think the rush-job to release these new DVD's out in time for a simultaneous release with Star Wars Battlefront (LucasArts actually reported a sales figure that COMBINED sales of the Trilogy DVD box set and the video game, and used this to claim that Star Wars Battlefront was the ""#1 best selling Star Wars game of all time""... can you say, fudge marketing??). It's too bad they didn't go back and repair the damage in the 2005 re-issue.I would recommend this WideScreen set over the ""2005 (repackaged) Edition."" Despite much of the bonus disc being fluff and lacking many features fans truly wanted (like actual deleted scenes and commentary that wasn't 50% Ben Burtt gushing about his sound effects skills, which are admittedly amazing of course).Also, this set, despite the cool looking silver packaging, is actually rather cheaply put together. It's thin cardboard, and you'll be lucky to purchase one that isn't already dented and banged up some by the time you get it home. Thankfully the amray cases inside are just fine (the artwork may not be to everyone's taste, but fan covers on the internet are plentiful, I wouldn't recommend buying the 2005 edition just for the artwork, unless you think losing the disc of extras is worth it).So let the Buyer Beware, and don't shoot the messenger! ;)",0.8333333333333334,3161,0.017492989263358145,0.014683069226870684,0.04451986547434646,0.0407248687058833,0.037550471440454175,0.20669447049551462,0.12871520253910884,0.13021345968260567,0.07446220474997375,0.11105812817507424,0.02151440194440081,0.02742955385806699,0.007010410373504392,0.0912451195877261,0.038913657505891264,0.06498297697283834,0.027686349141778366,0.00714140598553756,0.06169398878107296,0.02615890781156637,0.033102946128045437,0.046433250235951753,0.08050827145120391,0.02696996662146841,0.07255010757019063,0.0,0.005578572007999628,0.006599977182899446,0.02286666946997671,0.03310327981205035,0.09411130124331284,0.028409953884547756,0.0152520723782409,0.10285236448349908,0.0,0.03309120813161722,0.27851040503808033,0.041586099597626526,0.20626568944874735,0.12619730070593696,0.0,0.05120345427644638,0.07035286807208488,0.006720249783582558,0.0655965261493368,0.01992747802257795,0.04096114310498592,0.049023304804554385,0.017228305231901796,0.08486793256876184,0.05937270939318614,0.011483375074628877,0.013245327697302191,0.08396000037311346,0.22244340262126977,0.13800344307675003,0.06180452759246586,0.026292083223376644,0.08284992201197189,0.04066657950061544,0.046161631112464366,0.02998765725545907,0.0,0.025671147080292205,0.03172321832481013,0.0,0.022653854623120123,0.0,0.10651946677730363,0.06561245977064085,0.012467122882445726,0.046242048734682746,0.14704010752397037,0.6189188338394497,0.06046803744324529,0.0353843716077754,0.05082652066795383,0.02831864477026219,0.128607760931741,0.1718759673928332,0.054393827944970705,0.222335008000263,0.05747786464676888,0.014729802462993685,0.0792825084065249,0.029469322644436836,0.08197825237041653,0.027392923700549198,0.021744697907143794,0.014104839588589982,0.036902196692960056,0.034245310255416946,0.02913836233283576,0.09026026445932897,0.07309269788338243,0.022561987846774084,0.024903061757148723,0.06358624738019322,0.025348695430143852,0.10232721156851317,

293974,6302067057,A3SKGJ8KVUNYUE,2,2,1310860800,Outstanding in its representation of how oppressive Islamic culture can be on women.,"I had seen this film on television years ago before I decided to purchase a copy of it. The film has been referenced in the 1995 book by Geraldine Brooks:Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic WomenThis book I had read after readingThe Trouble with Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faith. What's wrong with Islam? After reading the abovereferenced books and seeing this film it seems rather simple:  just marry an Islamic man (even if you yourself are American born) and find out--you will disappear as a human being! As Geraldine Brooks wrote in NINE PARTS OF DESIRE the enforced wearing of the hijab signifies an acceptance of a legal code that values ""a future domestic life in which her husband could beat her if she disobeyed him, make her share his attentions with three more wives, divorce her at whim and get absolute custody of her children.""Sally Field did an exceptional job of portraying Betty Mahmoody, the wife of an Iranian born American doctor who after agreeing to come to Iran to visit relatives finds herself trapped there with her seven-year-old daughter. She had made the nearly fatal mistake of trusting the man she loved who swore on the Koran before the family left the U.S. that they would be returning back to the United States after only a two week stay! The film is explicit on just how much courage and determination it took to escape the barbarism this poor woman was subjected to. I truly admire her for what she was able to accomplish.  Betty was lucky she made it out alive but just how many more were not so fortunate?  To think that there were as many American women there basically stripped of their rights as citizens of the United States simply because they married a Middle Eastern Islamic man is horrific.This film as much today as it did years ago impresses me just how careful one must be over who one marries. Thank God my husband, a fifth-generation German Irish Catholic and an American Army veteran has neve treated me in such an primitive and barbaric way. As a woman I feel very fortunate indeed to have been born and raised in America and never to have married someone who treated me in such an abysmal fashion.",1.0,388,0.0,0.20181815684212884,0.0,0.0,0.2580648098013699,0.16234323616569504,0.03276268405496312,0.21600774024258418,0.03655285039242757,0.06938587313887831,0.0492857553473179,0.09425451036671291,0.0,0.02850364217500243,0.03820475382943884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044944133256145574,0.1895827395479724,0.0,0.0553291369255861,0.0,0.04532718714781146,0.0,0.0,0.1360746050098906,0.07857534780778984,0.06500045162678161,0.0,0.3904935977865225,0.05240977018902455,0.03926948163937667,0.14615152021714276,0.07580620610960169,0.17400516242598682,0.0,0.04572762993225899,0.11119080040069877,0.0,0.1563976184838541,0.0,0.0,0.1001801598695007,0.1369511654167226,0.08042987933794127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906750382688509,0.03945962448449156,0.0,0.03205629456990263,0.26586739387631214,0.09178313258869801,0.06534619856004625,0.045172944546661174,0.0,0.0,0.07931120500077955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2594802169063734,0.0,0.03660263756956938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819348637347626,0.30794616575139966,0.04617392119415239,0.0,0.0,0.1167715673779335,0.07685687646445019,0.08590646548871127,0.0,0.24359301921567916,0.0,0.050615125792122934,0.0,0.04050545759603284,0.08895691288471497,0.0,0.04981332336926702,0.0,0.0,0.09414006417114837,0.08010110813411093,0.0,0.04566618171989862,0.15505677769323234,0.04278643948599533,0.11653203244721728,0.043552091451543484,0.06393105157828102,

From the amazing intro sequence down to the end credits, this show is an amazing combination of storytelling, animation, and music (which held closely to Danny Elfman's style). Part of the appeal of this show is that it holds one of the widest audiences in television history, capturing the full attention of both kids and adults. The packaging, along with everything that is included for the money Amazon is charging for this set is amazing!

177095,1424810248,A3EBJDZ5N1UEI5,38,51,1182124800,"A good message, but ultimately troubling.","Our family (sons 18 and 15) watched this together, and to be truthful, I was disappointed. Not disappointed in the quality; it is adequate, even if the actors are all volunteers. Actually, I think they did a terrific job considering their lack of experience. It is certainly watchable. I have seen far, far away worse acting in huge budget movies. The plot is interesting, if not over worn. Even the fact that is was painfully predictable did not put me off- it is, after all, an 'underdog comes from behind' movie.To be fair, I would like to share what I liked about it.The photography is excellent, and the setting is believable for a small town in the south. Too, there's none of the teeth-gritting fake Southern accents film makers love to use just to make sure we know we're in the south. (Even my sons, who've lived outside the US as AF brats and visit family is SC every so often, commented that the accents sounded real)The characters are interesting. No one is very 'bad,' however the rival coach seems a bit cartoonish. There's no foul language and no sex. There is humor and kindness, and excellent role models for kids.The message is a good one: All things are possible with God.The less emphasized message is even better: Give God the praise, no matter the outcome of your prayers.This brings me to what bothered me about the film. This second, more important message was not illustrated. Prayers were answered beyond the characters' wildest dreams (in the most cliched manner possible, at that.)I know God works miracles, and Christ changes lives, however accepting His decisions, even when they are disappointing to us, is a situation we all face. Had the film shown this in at least about one situation, I believe it would have been a much stronger message and witness.And...more trivial, I know....I just can't get very worked up about winning a football game. Had the team lost, but left proud and confident because they did their very best and were thankful for the changes made in themselves and their lives, I would have felt much better about the message being given to my sons.Bottom line: A missed opportunity to show what is truly important.",0.7450980392156863,375,0.20628178314500353,0.05194394719897568,0.13999722360638056,0.0,0.037954690256060485,0.27159531147456734,0.13491932795552927,0.031769177983349106,0.07526376656948908,0.07143413034933357,0.05074066106797984,0.048518442407376385,0.04960112639366372,0.029345064037523783,0.0,0.04179795323263265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23135437576978382,0.11710751064627344,0.0,0.0854436631073503,0.038164405561200584,0.04666523672051531,0.03822383643406801,0.0,0.09339433357041747,0.0,0.1003788780962539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040428708947184734,0.0,0.07804399027570232,0.17914176030207182,0.0,0.32954250347564595,0.11447313077076098,0.0,0.08050722257785502,0.038290104567355404,0.04754813786255461,0.0,0.1409939366517779,0.0828041534205092,0.04955102500206582,0.030474084248544725,0.05003921342015771,0.09335174741064903,0.08124892954273465,0.18743073179351283,0.13201036010541886,0.06842893665034996,0.0,0.10091280806747313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449374462750899,0.037683140169478914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08435356465816947,0.47555501321213,0.14261089856379344,0.0,0.0,0.12021864088206438,0.11868851431649471,0.0884424073080178,0.0,0.20518677557960927,0.05083452104240237,0.0,0.043150131905604766,0.1251035120066743,0.09158290330601103,0.0,0.0,0.14969507359515888,0.0,0.09691906019019872,0.12369851543394396,0.04257488075822589,0.0,0.03990850575273548,0.0,0.02999300873192795,0.1345132216542983,0.0,

I felt there was not enough character development between the the lead actors and even with the circus performers. The director had many chances to develop bonds, but they were passed over. Witherspoon and Pattison were miss matched and had very little chemistry. The last 20min of the film seemed rushed, as if they needed to wrap up the story fast! Lastly, they opened the story like in Titanic. Except with an old man telling his story. That was probably the worst part! They wasted a good 20min at the beginning and end with the old guy telling his story.....which (by the way Hollywood) has been done before and the novelty has worn off! A simple narrative at the start is all you need, or just give us the 1930's story straight up! I would say it's an AVERAGE film and would not recommend it to friends.",1.0,163,0.0,0.0,0.05899527230077321,0.0,0.1279538110294776,0.21129437957038702,0.0,0.053550527863867985,0.12686555600939708,0.0,0.0,0.08178329963115345,0.0,0.09892882152834011,0.06629944429419925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07799477186712862,0.1973978997888562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06443058171348715,0.0,0.1574266688553074,0.13635742604538623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13629428536748014,0.0,0.0657759681106149,0.04313765927315922,0.0,0.03967721486878762,0.11577441346861575,0.0,0.06785199585833855,0.06454228411636181,0.0,0.1738498030455571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125916557944321,0.07689645355235013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057809701362426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3717167444681586,0.0,0.047395811510677024,0.5344010264532846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06754735340949541,0.26675047940523866,0.0,0.0,0.15371796523776826,0.0,0.0,0.1454688152240993,0.07029202024146831,0.2058310654816827,0.0,0.08644462604244874,0.0,0.0,0.1633679925862532,0.0,0.0,0.0792477942557566,0.0,0.0,0.20222637811556296,0.15115812414226412,0.05547206522657601,

One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. ~ Mr. BernsteinThat seems to be what it is all about.

963791,B000DZIGDU,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,9,9,1148688000,Fills Us in with Operation Desert Storm,"""Jarhead"" is a marine expression that describes a recruit as an open vessel waiting to be filled by the commanders that be and by the haircut that makes the marine look like one.  The movie is a recollection of the first Persian Gulf War, told from the point of view of Private Anthony Swofford (who wrote the book, but is played by Jake Gyllenhall) and his trek from marine recruit until the end of Operation Desert Storm.  The war only lasted six weeks, and his contributions only four days, but the process he undergoes is absorbing.  ""Swoff"" undergoes initiation and later reluctance until he meets his command leader Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Fox) who gets him ready.  His biggest challenge is keeping a fellow marine in check (Fowler, an ex-con) who seems unstable at best and incorrigible at worst.The movie isn't as intense as the most acclaimed war movies, but it isn't less insightful.  We are given a palpable reality.  The scenes show the urgency of missing women, the boredom and agony of anticipation, and the wild comraderie in all its details.  The best scenes are when the narrative focuses on Swoff separate from his brigade and he shares his inner angst.  The dream sequence tells more than any scene and has a surreal stream-of-consciousness effect.  We also get a first-person feel to when they have to play football in the grueling 112 degree heat.  Other revelations are done well, too.  For instance, their frenzy is present when watching ""Apocolyse Now"".  There's an interview scene where Swoff and others show their reluctance to follow the military's command to keep silence about the downside of being a recruit.  (They're just brimming to tell it like it is.) Later, Swoff gets into big trouble during a holiday party where he shares contraband liquor.  The war itself, for all its brevity, in the movie and in real life, just tells the unvarnished truth.  It shows the war, like any war, in all its mundane horror.  Swoff leaves us with some concrete thoughts about how his experience changed him forever.""Jar Head"" is a good movie experience.  It feels genuine.  The performances are fine, too.  Gyllenhall makes the experience authentic, and the supporting cast is believable throughout.  Jamie Fox, in particular, shows an acting range here that makes us appreciate his other contributions.  (His Oscar for ""Ray"" seems all the more deserving after seeing this film.)  The music and other atmospherics help to create a solid movie--even if it doesn't brim with suspense.  Overall, it doesn't try to sensationalize anything.  (3 1/2-4 stars)",1.0,427,0.07610911144619725,0.047912709571925956,0.12913239515345803,0.0442967969096667,0.1400364931194058,0.2505174901308679,0.12444858206886864,0.08791095864688424,0.06942273707309388,0.06589030917962688,0.0,0.0,0.091503418261093,0.08120300476282472,0.10884015411529434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04267991021933915,0.036006364866041425,0.08658146326457758,0.07881259773236271,0.10560768934065862,0.043043666387742575,0.03525738170753449,0.0,0.0,0.03730841543630452,0.030862909557480413,0.1535485317897628,0.0,0.09953887745639875,0.3356202570553449,0.04626286984434279,0.03599359734436659,0.16523902391703493,0.045233565304904515,0.19540770939292762,0.14782482714219722,0.14598637344705542,0.07425926179694009,0.10595552081863463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07637793367894637,0.04570549598052183,0.14054534039143252,0.04615579733715181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16831557578710363,0.02905307526427593,0.031027073898866716,0.08579438862940168,0.0,0.13270018568943887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052924741445239,0.0,0.03892758982492608,0.0,0.04311247030367047,0.10374279873499873,0.5665875143041216,0.08769548629672576,0.0,0.0,0.03696292597640456,0.07298493372976639,0.020394654255667544,0.0,0.16823355715750174,0.09377876631526427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09205174644684895,0.040138843030633926,0.0,0.0,0.11781225764462976,0.0,0.11043392437558487,0.0,0.055330655217878444,0.0,0.0,
462467,6305368139,A1IMNNBC4ME0NB,5,5,1091232000,Very sweet,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great chemistry onscreen, and in You've Got Mail they're wonderful together.  The plot is pretty simple.  Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, the owner of a small children's bookshop; Hanks is Joe Fox, who owns the literary megastore that is nudging Kathleen's shop towards bankruptcy.  Face-to-face they do not get along, but unknowingly, they strike up a friendship online; it's an anonymous relationship, where they have the freedom of speaking their minds and hearts without knowing the other person's identity.  There's a twist when they chat online one evening and tentatively agree to meet in person.  It winds up being one of the movie's most painful scenes, but not because they immediately identify one another...There's much to recommend in this movie, if you like romantic comedies and are a fan of Hanks and Ryan.  They're at their best here, and bolstered by a lively supporting cast.  You've Got Mail is also set in New York City - a definite plus - and better yet, alludes to some wonderful books (children's books mainly, but also Pride and Prejudice, which the film's plot echoes at times).",1.0,188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1806066538280492,0.07136950129737048,0.3535644864864967,0.06342513327470081,0.0,0.14152499861248186,0.0,0.09541207296092687,0.0,0.09326930691888238,0.16554021954346382,0.07396041176889537,0.0,0.0920875689862439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07340247521992337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774869851915386,0.0,0.0742195559263828,0.0,0.0,0.1258340830814757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07337644738576561,0.19248903676668128,0.0,0.1770478278229082,0.08610150893014698,0.0,0.0,0.07200020996509034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09317509691984081,0.11460613592890041,0.0,0.08776870016574928,0.0,0.0,0.12411527407084606,0.17156383221140067,0.0,0.1897551195307888,0.0,0.0,0.09017407642590448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07935767629212553,0.0,0.0,0.052872445203244696,0.26081632612911265,0.1787757743316519,0.0,0.0,0.15070503607531688,0.5207540898145014,0.041576485412789334,0.0,0.1714802307363653,0.0,0.0,0.16227788314130823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08005724686488279,0.0884049565924533,0.07504343030809407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18564575447825643,
482475,6305897786,AQJO5TOH4LU8M,18,22,1248825600,An exceptional and underrated film.,"When this film was released in 1999 it did not get the press it deserved and I never saw it until I it aired on HBO.  After the first viewing, I was hooked on the film.  I have always thought Depp was an excellent actor and he plays an almost likable but undoubtedly dark character than has clearly adopted the ""me above all others"" way of thinking.  He is hired by Frank Langella who plays a very dark, Devil worshiping book collector with a hidden agenda, lyrically named Boris Balkan. Throughout the film, Depp is visited and aided by Emmanuelle Seigner (who to this day I have never seen in anything else in spite of a long European filmography)but one of the mysteries of the film is that you never know who this girl is.  An agent of the Devil, the Devil itself or a dark angel?  As usual, Lena Olin plays a forgettable character and is probably the weakest part of the film.  Even though Langella's portrayal of the evil book collector goes a little over the top toward the end, the film and the interactions between Depp and the other possessors of this rare book are not to be missed.  I am looking forward to the blu-ray release.",0.8181818181818182,210,0.0,0.08530342974280555,0.057476587610626455,0.0,0.18698994367518806,0.2058551379692698,0.05539183116521027,0.05217200440521674,0.0,0.0586553068074595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09638214819656227,0.12918546418715138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07598699291592367,0.38463277611549057,0.07707449479069722,0.0,0.0,0.07663462167731384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06642362378209109,0.10989618665347649,0.1366883287405829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608156666641537,0.0,0.1932791245478863,0.15039212373656752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718105777409799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10839507859731076,0.2996677921590129,0.10345175577674938,0.055240370292220606,0.0,0.06876124167566053,0.07875280600876325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767571196545901,0.04617572572225355,0.5857247453151749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452419595527554,0.0,0.11232066255163325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06848252922944353,0.15039934735573046,0.0,0.0842193268786985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991735409817418,0.0,0.19661573293101342,0.0,0.04925514234293351,0.0,0.05404407662842321,

1323331,B0034G4P30,A205C7VCSDVARI,0,0,1390608000,Hugh Who Fights With Monsters,"Director: Denis Villeneuve.Writer: Aaron Guzikowski.Staring: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and David Dastmalchian.Running Time: 153 minutes.Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Content including Torture, and Language throughout.Let's get this right out of the way for Prisoners: It is not a happy a movie. If you're expecting a good time or to come out with a smile on your face, this is not your type of movie. You would be much better off popping in something like Pacific Rim or seeing if Frozen is still playing where you live. But even if a film is horribly depressing, that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it if given the chance. Far from it with something like Prisoners, the English language debut of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies). While its grueling content and odd plot points may cause some contention with viewers, Prisoners delivers on damn near every cylinder you should expect to see in a good mystery: Excellent performances, a plot that keeps you guessing till the very end, haunting cinematography and some interesting debates on morality and what one would do and how far they would go to save a loved one.One day, somewhere in Pennsylvania, a small get together with two families is going on. Set sometime around Thanksgiving, the two families The Dovers (Hugh Jackman playing Keller and Maria Bello playing Grace) and The Birches (Viola Davis playing Nacy and Terrence Howard playing Franklin) are having a nice get together. Everybody's laughing, chowing down tasty food, just having a good time together. The teens hang out while the youngsters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, are off playing around in the neighborhood.A few hours latter, the two youngest disappear. An investigation is soon kicked into motion and headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to find out who it is Eventually, the find a suspect in the form of mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Paul Dano). But due to the fact there is a lack of evidence on whether he did it or not, he winds up being released. The father of one of the families, Keller Dover, however, becomes increasingly unstable over the course of the investigation, resorting to his own (brutal) methods to find out if Alex actually did it or not.So yes, as one can tell from that synopsis up top, Prisoners isn't what one would call a ""feel good movie"". On top of that, it isn't one that goes by quick. It fully expects you to sit down and watch as it takes you on a long journey of what its like to have a child taken from you. Whether you have or haven't had kids, you feel steeped in the misery and horror of what the parents go through in the film. Hell, the film was originally slapped with an NC-17 rating before it got re-edited with a R. Frankly, after watching the film itself, it doesn't surprise me that it almost got the former.Another interesting note to make is that in addition to being a Drama-Mystery-Thriller, the film is also a play on morality. Most of the characters never stay clean for long, especially High Jackman's character, who pulls some especially dickish things to find his kid. As seen in the trailers (don't worry; this all happens in the first half hour), he winds up kidnapping Alex to find out where the children are, but what he does will make your stomach churn. Even as the film went as on, I found myself conflicted with his character, wanting him to find his kids but I wished he'd stop being such an ass in trying to find his kid. The film itself and its characters are even asking themselves if what they're doing is justified or not.What I found interesting about the film is that you never really know who's who or what till the end. For the majority of the film's running time, it keeps you guessing on whether Alex did it or not. Is he playing stupid? Does he genuinely not know what happened to the kids? Was he manipulated into doing what he did? It's like being in a maze, a nightmarish labyrinth from where there is no escape from until the very end.The film's performances are uniformly excellent, with Hugh Jackman showing us a scary side of his acting abilities that we haven't seen before. His character shows a broad range of anger, ruthlessness and regret. The performance as Dover is so good, it outright makes his iconic Wolverine role look downright pathetic by comparison. I can also safely say that thanks to this role, Jackman's was able to partially redeem himself after being in last year's blunderpiece Movie 43. He's not quite there yet, but I hold him in much higher regard than I did after 43. The rest of the supporting cast also give great performances as well. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to be one of the best actors working today, with an almost equally compelling side role as the determined Detective Loki. One scene in particular that stands out for me with him is when flips out in his office. I won't say what happens in regards to that part in what triggers him, but damn, he really lost it in a big way.Terrence Howard and Paul Dano bring their goods to the table as well, as does Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Melissa Leo also shows up as Alex Jones' mother, Holly, and while she doesn't have that many scenes in the film, she is compelling enough to keep an admirable presence on-screen. Even the kids who play Joy and Anna (Kyla Drew Simmons and Erin Gerasimovich, respectively) do their roles without some kind of saccharine or sickly-sweet kind of way that one would usually expect from kids in movies.Shot by famous cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption), Prisoners looks unsurprisingly beautiful in its imagery. Damn near every frame looks downright perfect, with scenes that look like they were molded by a paint brush than a camera. Denis and Deakins obviously know what they're doing, and I hope that they collaborate more in the future. Then there's the score by J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson, who achieves haunting yet minimalist work that help establish the mood of the picture quite excellently.If there were any problems I had with the film, I'd say it would be some plot elements. There's something that happens to Paul Dano's character in which he ends up disappearing from the public eye and it doesn't really get addressed until the last 30 minutes of the movie. Arguably, due to the investigation of the girls, I can see how their disappearance could be held in higher regard than Dano's but it was still a little something that bothered me.Then there's how the film handles its clues, foreshadowing and red-herrings, in which it maybe just a little too clever for its own good. It's great to see a film keep its audience guessing all the way through and then pull the rug under their feet when they least expect it, but it felt like the movie was getting a little overly complicated. Not that it was a major hindrance to the film's quality, but I can see how some would be fed up with the plot twists and the loopty loops the film pulls from time to time.It's a shame that the film was missed at the Oscar season. It was a big contender in the first couple of weeks it came out but due to being swarmed by a mountain of other films (Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street), it sadly got overlooked and wound up with only a nom for Best Cinematography. Yet, in spite of that, its more than worth checking out. Its imagery, performances and plot won't leave you for a while and it will keep you engaged all the way through its long running time.",0.0,1326,0.013695360095362978,0.05172956022716958,0.03485485412978781,0.06376745945093898,0.06299673466552823,0.20112196211613184,0.05598436614239456,0.11600621207563963,0.012492188713749994,0.059282751687864975,0.0,0.0,0.032930939258913,0.0974131629289023,0.09139716674161444,0.055500588761893344,0.03251369867500347,0.01677314124304365,0.0,0.061439870016594914,0.22029010966811718,0.031159589028445484,0.08509101358452069,0.10135170813773828,0.06196351525365341,0.07613215227388773,0.02620497319832014,0.031002956480510126,0.0,0.03332152894301851,0.16578060589723212,0.0,0.07164560165531673,0.12078554560239564,0.06659771998637257,0.09067552811333249,0.2378698572456566,0.032557992254880645,0.13283572962204496,0.22800133728441463,0.17512891824057294,0.026724982368079922,0.07626414152679918,0.0,0.017118630271344124,0.046804005285128486,0.027487465960297608,0.016448838093003043,0.060696618624855696,0.01661089593636225,0.030988819682189514,0.0,0.031109525593022918,0.09859913775215959,0.1968677001438894,0.1150142347131565,0.11166257013808525,0.015438165340713335,0.12509422434527748,0.015919047388722796,0.13552575645234802,0.0,0.0,0.04522069359178265,0.05960708832109876,0.0,0.03547166146857555,0.0,0.025018407649805677,0.08405732509551002,0.0,0.06206256193930757,0.2053465682198974,0.46043692599541686,0.0631210240535077,0.0,0.05116161870140845,0.09311747312884434,0.0787991027596181,0.029359127047409478,0.09936554860531001,0.2119080581984188,0.01687490432593417,0.05189420494247279,0.10026809200499864,0.027686038970644315,0.08107103595428077,0.03216911202217864,0.08512023403198807,0.01656413786787988,0.02889093821595251,0.03217301618136319,0.1779381898708009,0.02826610833546922,0.03121346509270067,0.07948758472298709,0.029245121554691465,0.13938969019230535,0.1041895933190267,0.1638665834012127,

I saw it in September 1964 in one of those old style gothic looking theaters. Huge screen, big giant red curtains, as a kid I'd never seen anything like it. Back then we all saw the same things, and Mary Poppins was a huge movie with couples as well as families. You'd seen grown adults there alone with no kids watching it.

1229767,B001PSULZ0,A3T861X55PQ50O,2,4,1268870400,English Dub for Clannad is on it's way!!!,"I know Clannad is a wonderful show and a lot of people dislike the English sub-titles only feature. Well just announced today via email from Anime Network is the English dubbed version. It will first air on Anime Network VOD March 25 2010. Unfortunately like any series, the entire dubbed version of the show must air on tv first before being released on DVD (I know, BOOHOO, you want it now. If I had cookie and a kleenex I'd give you one). I am personally so excited and so put out from having to watch the subbed version that I'm simply going to wait for the show to air on the 25th. Show's like Air and Kanon were so lovely, partly due to being able to watch the show completely without having to constantly keep your eyes glued to the bottom of the screen reading the subs. Show's from Kyoto and Key animation are extremely vivid with details and color out the wazoo. Not being able to see that from constantly reading is such a shame.So my professional advice as an anime artist is, before purchasing something you can't understand, wait for Clannad to either air or be released in a dubbed format so you can enjoy the beauty the artist's of the show are trying to convey. Us native English speaking homosapiens connect better with characters when we understand what they are saying.I never once doubted the Japanese. I always knew they would release a dubbed version of Clannad and shame on everyone that thought otherwise. The Japanese did give us the Nintendo and the Sony Playstation so we need to stop complaining about ""Sub titles in english only"". English dub will always be on it's way. The Japanese do have the right to view their shows before us spoiled Americans.

The scenes with The Pit and the pendulum weren't even significant to the story, and were very brief. If they called this The pit and the Pendulum, it's an insult to the classic first starring Vincent Price, and Luana Anders. I thought the movie was okay, but very extreme. It is during the Inquisition when Maria (Always beautiful Rona Di Ricci), and her baker husband Antonio (Jonathan Fuller), accidently attend the Auto D' Fey, a festival for burning assumed heretics at the stake, and Maria can't stand watching people in pain. She runs out in the defense of a young boy being horse whipped for his father's ""Mistakes"". She pleads mercy from Torquemada, the infamous leader of the whole Inquisition, but the Grand Inquisitor himself, falls in love with Maria with one look at her. He has her arrested thinking any feeling of love is witch craft. She is taken to Torquemada's torturess castle, and finds out what really is going on behind the walls. It is up to Antonio to save Maria from a terrible fate. I thought the plot was good, the acting, okay, but everything else, No! I thought it was wrong to have so much nudity in the movie, let alone any nudity. Dark Humor, woah, there's somewhere I do not want to go. Besides the terrible stuff, even the great acting couldn't save a film like this. I have to say all the actors are highly underrated, especially Rona Di Ricci, who got less credit then she deserved. Frances Bay as Esmerelda the good witch, was wonderful, Lance Henriksen, I have to say I think he was a too good for the part. Jonathan Fuller, okay, he was good, but a little over exaggerent. All in all a pretty good movie. Now I see why they changed the DVD's name to The Inquisitor.",0.5,326,0.0,0.0,0.11632256062235749,0.0,0.04204832681183904,0.1851621311200305,0.03736779273413988,0.03519567066349703,0.08338140642047555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13004040708956838,0.0,0.046306108302677146,0.05425466236491722,0.0,0.05373183913562242,0.10252292231697019,0.04324608145971409,0.05199509902168053,0.09465926466795124,0.08456132229194985,0.0,0.2117325099399713,0.043727475836195746,0.0,0.04480993232985209,0.14827377390327764,0.13831663523597523,0.1670179532789783,0.0,0.04478918296851338,0.0,0.04323074680195448,0.1417594662028226,0.0,0.13038771447002775,0.10145578491300702,0.0,0.0,0.042419917529179826,0.10535296832358308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504357381177337,0.0,0.05171014118541571,0.0,0.10382311924910703,0.036562113449041214,0.07580939989889929,0.03489470998276352,0.03726561596203915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09045915362099427,0.05876434668862547,0.0,0.05030563655139698,0.04973230643093957,0.0,0.23676211503796307,0.0,0.04174748845143267,0.0,0.04886159162302463,0.0,0.0,0.6366060885709801,0.0,0.0,0.056914602394375825,0.044394976102476925,0.13148976859308487,0.07348608079971418,0.0,0.2778323484811049,0.05631732309481653,0.0,0.047804127397696676,0.0923977743405157,0.20292131605386005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053686175406517066,0.045680042598294876,0.047166832031019026,0.0,0.04421287280022601,0.0,0.09968379333795811,0.0,0.0,
773958,B0000C8AQU,A3LDRRC6MYEGJP,6,6,1092009600,A charming series well worth the investment,"Rarely have I found such an excellent blending of the ""blowing stuff up"" and ""heartwarming"" genres as this series. The ""look"" is very compelling, with a successful blend of CG and traditional techniques, and the design of the world is intriguing and inventive. The character development may seem slow at first, but keeping in mind that it's a 26-episode series, I don't find the pacing a problem. The curlicued roads that the plot twists take you are each well worth the journey.The dub is easily an A-, but if you want the full A+ experience, go for the subtitled version to get the amazing nuances that the Japanese actors put into the show. For example, you get a whole different picture of Alex Rou (captain of the Sylvana, a man with a mysterious and troubled past) in the Japanese version--in English, he's just one of many characters, but in Japanese, with each terse word, the arctic winds that chill Alex's soul send shivers up your own spine.My only criticism of the series is that the ep. 26 is a little unsatisfying--they really needed a double-length hour-long show to wind up all the plot lines that had been so meticulously spun over the previous 25 episodes; a minor issue, to be sure.This series deserves a place of honor in the library of anyone who appreciates the artistry and beauty of anime.",1.0,230,0.0,0.0,0.048388623143504894,0.0,0.10494923576443062,0.17330616008086694,0.046633499915476204,0.043922779078460226,0.052028318034812004,0.049380968050860244,0.0,0.06707963385792119,0.0,0.12171389188341358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06985792058003022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488778887968555,0.07875396587819627,0.0,0.12903493343098255,0.0,0.0,0.06456161193002044,0.0,0.04625992410081934,0.05753786282817464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05395023039434339,0.17691010283161818,0.06779987136070802,0.16271861479690722,0.031653183068816516,0.0,0.05565301301407447,0.0,0.0,0.07129683680630929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056165740022252615,0.0,0.0,0.31535692326721665,0.0,0.0465059874202367,0.06429792205560816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06277940777926298,0.0,0.30866066516431934,0.0,0.15068168950966243,0.052099183728145905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332476456837051,0.6574831050371622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05469797798153473,0.061138445561815954,0.0,0.09456097582304827,0.0,0.0,0.17897287539730955,0.05765434999806669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06016347320182517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05517588407378962,0.0,0.12440135817690323,0.0,0.1364965405476497,

1626636,B00BEIYG98,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,1,2,1361750400,'Dark Skies' surprisingly entertaining,"Written and directed by Scott Stewart, Dark Skies stars Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton as Lacy and Daniel Barrett (respectively), a typical married couple with two sons, Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan Rockett).  After a series of abnormal occurrences at home (while the family is sleeping), paranoia grows amongst Daniel and Lacy when they start to believe intruders may be entering the house, eventually finding a connection between their son, Sam, and his bad dreams.  Sam claims the &#8220;sandman&#8221; enters his dreams and causes him to do things he doesn&#8217;t want to do, but as time progresses, the entire family soon starts experiencing similar unexplainable events, including unaccountable time gaps, abusive marks to their body, and random ringing in their ears.  J.K. Simmons also stars in a supporting role as Edwin Pollard, a conspiracy theorist that has previously dealt with these occurrences.When this film begins, the very first thing you&#8217;ll see is the Dimension Films logo &#8211; and in case you are unaware of that particular meaning, it should instantly tapper your expectations.  In the past, Dimension Films has been responsible for some of the worst films to grace the big screen &#8211; films such as the Halloween sequels, basically anything Wes Craven has ever done, and a slew of cult favorites &#8211; like Sin City, Scary Movie, and The Crow.  However &#8211; and surprisingly, Dark Skies is an entertaining experience, especially since it initially had the potential to be a complete bust.  After watching countless films with a wide variety of alien encounters, Signs - the 2002 sci-fi thriller starring Mel Gibson &#8211; immediately comes to mind as a comparison for Dark Skies.  Both feature plots about aliens invading the earth and hitting a family at the core in a very real way, while the majority of the plot takes place in the family&#8217;s houses.  The aliens themselves are also comparable in both of these films, with Signs featuring a much more corporeal creature and Dark Skies featuring ghost-like creatures.The majority of the scenes in this film are dominated by Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton &#8211; the married couple struggling to pay their bills while assuming the job of protecting their sons from super natural, alien creatures.  Their on-screen presence is another unexpected surprise in the film &#8211; featuring a decent amount of dramatic scenes in which it&#8217;s completely believable that they&#8217;re a struggling married couple.  Some scenes are better than others as far as the suspense goes, and for those of us that don&#8217;t enjoy the scenes that make you jump, this film will be tolerable, borderline enjoyable to you.  The hardcore sci-fi/horror buffs will find this to be another tedious disappointment that never meets the mark.  Also, there's a historically memorable scene involving a few flock of birds that will be reminiscent of Hitchcock's suspense thriller, The Birds.Overall, Dark Skies is a clich&eacute; driven film, yet it makes for a great date night experience &#8211; with just the right amount of scary.  If there were any more &#8220;jump out&#8221; scenes, the film may have you thinking about nonchalantly taking a bathroom break or twisting your date&#8217;s arm to let you go buy them some popcorn.  But - rest assured, you&#8217;ll survive this one to tell the tale.Overall Film Grade:  BFNDNreview.com",0.5,544,0.07000239106473072,0.08813673340006935,0.0,0.12222774545374267,0.03220011759567031,0.28358999505546034,0.11446327704922184,0.18866703483973066,0.06385250723640541,0.15150877151643308,0.0,0.04116222634241663,0.0,0.049791712512255885,0.06673814200997855,0.0,0.08309517361208481,0.04286707266196879,0.0,0.0,0.23182140881616667,0.03981723958693256,0.09665194582628071,0.03237803651534968,0.0,0.0,0.033485990307963766,0.03961708689292366,0.1029447685468196,0.02838658109634396,0.03530708796068616,0.0,0.045776118610797965,0.06859806646071144,0.0,0.03310560101477436,0.21711548725620727,0.0,0.09984938896031069,0.07769365519771507,0.0,0.03415048333708637,0.0649693548545023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07024964397185603,0.0,0.025853697917263822,0.0,0.03959902220390577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270918447681667,0.026721961374107133,0.0285375734835397,0.0,0.03552255310306887,0.0,0.03463628169124557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03808441944779792,0.04735103425506504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741254158741312,0.0,0.039653281303876284,0.1669829893044928,0.5379371120436081,0.24197735105716528,0.04247971427140299,0.0,0.0679943084324695,0.06712888609133587,0.0937913040703714,0.07255664841852479,0.23210265567235014,0.0,0.04420862738768293,0.0,0.0707571364886062,0.0,0.0,0.043508311345870486,0.0,0.0,0.041112246132583415,0.0,0.07223961822834853,0.039886085044313,0.0,0.11211251958064188,0.12722780790732893,0.0,0.1954369168748336,

35511,0780627024,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,2,2,1211673600,A trip down nostalgia lane...,"1998's Pleasantville is a charmingly executed parable about introducing change to a closed society, and the ripple effect that even the smallest changes can produce. Siblings David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are polar opposites; nerdy David is obsessed with the ficticious 1950s sitcom Pleasantville (an homage to Leave It To Beaver and other picture-perfect small-screen families), while Jennifer hangs out with the fast crowd, smoking and snaring potential dates.After a mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) gives the two a remote, they're transported into the black-and-white, picture-perfect town of Pleasantville, where the basketball team makes perfect baskets every shot and a nutritious dinner is always on the table (thanks, mom!). Horrified, the two at first try to desperately find a way back. David has the advantage of being intimately familiar with the Pleasantville universe, and tries to steer Jennifer away from any seismic outbursts that would be out of place in placid Pleasantville, such as swearing, smoking, and heaven forbid, s-e-x. Jennifer has her own agenda, though, and Lovers Lane soon becomes more than just a place to stargaze and hold hands. With each change comes the slow but sure colorization: first bubblegum turns pink, then the more ""adventurous"" teens end up in color.David and Jennifer's ""parents,"" George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen) Parker, are stamped straight out of 1950s legend; George begins every evening by announcing ""honey, I'm home!"" and Betty's always on call to whip up massive breakfasts or hors d'oeuvres. David, now ""Bud,"" works in the burger joint owned by Bill (Jeff Daniels), who's paralyzed by indecision and any break in routine. But a funny thing happens; the once-wild Jennifer slowly becomes more scholarly and more and more like her TV counterpart than her former ""bad girl"" self, while once-timid David learns to stand up for himself and to fight for what he believes in.In Pleasantville, the old guard is threatened by all of the changes: the once-empty books in the library are filled, Bill realizes his life's dream of becoming a painter, using every shade under the sun, rockabilly and rock and roll are heard...resulting in violence and trials that parallel McCarthyism. Betty and other wives begin to yearn for a fulfilling life outside of the home, leaving their husbands hungry and confused.Although the visual metaphors are heavy-handed at times, Pleasantville does an admirable job at capturing the balance between modern uncertainties (at school, the teens are given sobering statistics about AIDS, global warming, and underemployment) and our rose-tinted nostalgia for the past. The visual design deserves special mention, and the classic soundtrack is loaded with gems by Pat Boone, Miles Davis, Etta James, Elvis and Buddy Holly. Pleasantville was nominated for two dozen awards, and it's easy to see why. A delightful film for the entire family.",1.0,465,0.07687679138272063,0.048395984506344816,0.03260872454798396,0.0,0.07072449055668384,0.5255536552266964,0.18855576224300713,0.02959922625001808,0.1402459488430242,0.0332774582221077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054681376409750515,0.18322996338179584,0.03894299925445991,0.0,0.04707672055337069,0.0,0.04311040415292248,0.03636954561233538,0.08745477331852608,0.15921509314910956,0.03555763625660981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536945881556371,0.0,0.03877432747940206,0.14046051953903108,0.0,0.03766727939108293,0.0,0.0,0.19074939316651632,0.045689816861152706,0.1096548350426473,0.04266167791949226,0.0,0.03750414154705938,0.035674749558204495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19287081277484178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14876163990523647,0.05869224232625875,0.0,0.0,0.03901095180821801,0.08935911699969439,0.11411293934469299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04182439948534137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08709465457028699,0.07859190585986559,0.5169183323136665,0.04429001651139673,0.0,0.04786464248138769,0.0,0.03686055071337509,0.0,0.0,0.23365437814472928,0.0,0.14565005737546816,0.12060845744842995,0.0,0.028442484693906023,0.0,0.047780930392192576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038416483916577544,0.0,0.0,0.03718260798861366,0.0,0.13972187946449263,0.041775157916174685,0.0,

928617,B000AM6P2U,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,7,8,1154217600,Tale of Two Stories - One is Better than the Other,"After watching ""Melinda and Melinda"", I discovered that this was a Woody Allen film.  I've just never been a fan of Woody Allen and have always found him overrated as a screenwriter and filmmaker.  However, after watching ""Melinda and Melinda"", I admit I was pleasantly surprised how good a movie this was.  In fact, I was also surprised why this movie didn't do well at the box office.  With Hollywood being focused on remakes, the concept of this movie is definitely something that is ""out of the box"" .  I was entertained throughout the movie.  It also features an unsung performance by Will Ferrell.""Melinda and Melinda"" actually has two parallel stories taking place around a character named ""Melinda"".  The movie starts off with two filmmakers conversing with a group of people over dinner.  One filmmaker makes comedies and the other focuses on the tragedy - and the two engage in a debate over why one is better than the other.  During the dinner gathering one proposes a story where a distressed woman shows up at the door crashing the dinner party - that woman being Melinda.  From that premise, we see the parallel stories develop as told from the two filmmakers - one from the comedic end and one from the tragic end.  Melinda, who is played by Radha Mitchell in both storylines is the central character in each of the storylines.  While Mitchell does play Melinda in each story, the character of Melinda are really two different people - with two different personalities.  At the same time, while these are two separate storylines, there are a lot of parallels between the two storylines.  For example:* Each Melinda crashes a dinner party in a distraught mood* Each Melinda is returning from the Midwest* Each Melinda will be rebounded from a broken marriage that involved  infidelity* Each Melinda wrecks havoc on a married couple* Each Melinda will be fixed up on dates, who are both dentists - and each will end up going up with different menMitchell's character of Melinda will appear in both of the storylines, but none of the other characters will appear in both.  In the tragic version, the married couple that Melinda will wreck havoc will be Lee and Laurel (played by Jonny Lee Miller and ""Big Love""'s Chloe Sevigny).  In the comedic version, the married couple is Susan and Hobie (played by Amanda Peet and Will Ferrell).  The two storylines could have easily been made into individual movies - and while both versions of the story are highly entertaining, I found myself more interested in the comedic version.  The comedic version took on much more of the form of a romantic comedy as opposed to a classic comedy.  A lot of why the comedic version worked was because of the performances by Peet and Ferrell.  Peet seemed born to play the career-driven Susan - and was very believable in the role.  However it is Will Ferrell that really shines as Hobie, the laid-back unlucky husband of Susan.  Ferrell has really emerged as one of the top Hollywood actors with audiences accustomed to his ""big name"" movies he has starred in (many are most familiar with his classic role of ""Frank the Tank"" in ""Old School"").  At the same time, Ferrell proves he can do the ""artsy"" film.  The amazing thing is while Melinda was the central character of the film, I found myself gravitating to Hobie's character throughout the comedic storyline.  By the end of the film, I felt that Hobie emerged as the hero of the storyline - and of the whole film.The tragic story isn't bad either, but it just didn't stand out compared to the comedy.  Miller and Sevigny's portrayal of Lee and Laurel were good, but didn't really standout to the characters of Peet and Ferrell.  At times I felt the tragic story was dragging on compared to the comedic story.  This is seen in the tragic story when Melinda and Laurel's friend pregnant friend Cassie (played by Brooke Smith) throws a dinner party to fix up Melinda with a dentist - it was just very slow.  I found the elements of the tragic storyline more difficult to follow.  I also found the ending of the tragic storyline unsatisfactory.  There were more loose-ends that could have been pulled in that storyline (i.e. such as Cassie being pregnant) that were just never explored.  Still this wasn't a bad story - it was just one that could have shined, but didn't.Another thing that one must be careful of is ""coming in during the middle of the film"".  The viewer will definitely be confused if they don't understand the premise of the film as both stories switch back and forth.With Radha Mitchell playing both Melindas, she has to be given credit for such a performance.  She does an excellent job in both movies - and does a great job at coming across as two different Melindas. Like Ferrell,  I'm surprised Mitchell's performance didn't get more attention - as it was a good one.  Wallace Shawn is very believable as the comedic filmmaker.The setting for both storylines (as well as where the filmmakers debating tragedy and comedy) is New York City.  This seemed to be the perfect setting for the entire film.  Most of the characters are definitely yuppie-like characters and New York City seems to be the perfect backdrop for this movie.Despite some of the weaknesses of the tragic storyline, overall this is still a very good film.  I have to give Woody Allen credit for keeping the storylines flowing and knowing when to switch back and forth between the storylines.  This is definitely a movie that shouldn't have flopped at the box office and is something worth checking out.",0.875,955,0.0,0.041800044526026675,0.0,0.05796817065015343,0.030542687420299943,0.23536872125303945,0.09500009033900854,0.16617325632995789,0.10599021995888157,0.11496815279910107,0.020415871398808624,0.058565237019621026,0.0,0.04722879371060915,0.11078015034077947,0.01681770832247495,0.03940901622841775,0.020330292227160148,0.0,0.0,0.14135715776263444,0.0,0.0687577497465286,0.09213434506565471,0.01877609498237728,0.061518546473923366,0.015881186332574945,0.0,0.06509727545639797,0.08077633295412633,0.03348973332474019,0.0,0.021709946833116098,0.03253356599275574,0.020180345013595235,0.015700781536763346,0.18534595091161093,0.019731351667531465,0.15153577831816523,0.055270908984897185,0.0,0.0809816559456479,0.030812600160914135,0.019131336632650344,0.02074905057449948,0.0,0.08329212272458673,0.03987442547372404,0.08583027503856348,0.06040091661684089,0.018780374850029077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29368401934200766,0.07603952169569952,0.12180899117009948,0.0,0.0,0.057885201233543834,0.04928018299719268,0.042684720379015884,0.0,0.07308111638039916,0.018062053893462954,0.0,0.0429942866985706,0.0,0.0,0.01698061957370746,0.14196658302039267,0.018806107966145538,0.1583879074876479,0.6218647296360186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032247225536400234,0.015918393610434192,0.08896360314376131,0.03441097732527505,0.12842414804831626,0.0,0.20966542801757784,0.08680883588077473,0.0671150686361961,0.1473961700041751,0.0,0.0,0.02007696462251099,0.035017961640950265,0.058494125636800676,0.0,0.034260621445788245,0.0,0.03211495096900204,0.19495991975847377,0.1086111328905648,0.0,0.0,

To me, Runaway Bride seems to have a terrible pedigree, which it seems to have largely overcome.Fortunately, this film is reasonably well-paced and  slickly written. It suffers a bit from predictability, cliche moments,  improbability (I have never met anyone who reads the USA Today editorial  page, let alone memorize the face of any of their writers), and overobvious  product placement.The presence of serveral capable secondary performers  (Hector Elizondo, Joan Cusack, Laurie Metcalf) helps when the Julia and  Richard show flags from time to time.

1512277,B0067EKYL8,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,8,11,1361145600,Heartwarming Comedy,"Parental Guidance is one of the few films, regardless of genre, that I have watched and felt genuinely happy while watching it. True, it wasn't anything particularly deep, complex, or emotional and it was also a bit predictable and cliched, but it was absolutely hilarious and I liked almost all of the characters! It was written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse and directed by Andy Fickman, all of whom I've never heard of before. It stars Billy Crystal and Bette Midler as Artie and Diane Decker, two old school grandparents who are looking after their daughter's kids for the week, all of whom have issues they need to overcome. I could pretty much predict the entire film, with a few exceptions, but I still enjoyed it for the most part, there were a few jokes here and there that I wasn't particularly fond of but overall it was a good film. Bailee Madison as Harper plays a young violinist who tends to take things too seriously, Joshua Rush, as Turner, has stuttering issues to overcome, and the youngest kid Barker, played by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf, is somewhat annoying and one of the few characters I didn't like too much in the film, alongside the overbearing mother Alice, played by Marisa Tomei. Parental Guidance is a breath of fresh air when it comes to modern American comedy. Most comedies nowadays tend to be more like Project X, Superbad, or Knocked Up, but Parental Guidance is fun for the whole family and I respect that! It didn't have to be crude or offensive to get laughs, and that alone keeps it from anything less than a 3 star rating! It makes me almost not care about how predictable it is, although there were a few vulgar jokes, for the most part it was clean. Some critics actually derided this film for being inoffensive, I find that very hard to believe and am disgusted that America has sunk so low to have a criticism like that! Highly recommend this movie!",0.7272727272727273,338,0.05018231825834741,0.06318220761407375,0.12771459608290997,0.05841392490615763,0.0,0.3557679323238313,0.04102740285303952,0.11592766283529604,0.0,0.08688916221891207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427758981322605,0.19136915933163842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18992552420598768,0.0,0.17321617990369814,0.04642141241979079,0.05676142907548695,0.046493701376458085,0.0,0.0,0.0983967749229488,0.16279494744982545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06100657369294012,0.0,0.031128532367508142,0.0,0.14315721901769032,0.38987145592306494,0.0,0.0,0.13972292057852798,0.0,0.0,0.057166161206644334,0.05035956540500831,0.18081470419516482,0.03706726234078523,0.0,0.1135487348206859,0.0,0.0,0.04014281946768232,0.24970135205693247,0.0,0.08183043882302417,0.0,0.1527894151660237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045836023523934476,0.051333583180925464,0.0,0.05685216039374587,0.23940877977324312,0.2651197341606273,0.05782176035879495,0.0,0.0,0.14622837764324065,0.048122400891260554,0.0537886206358019,0.0,0.24957967488825883,0.12366550621037148,0.06338330378692279,0.052485818649691506,0.05072336942087024,0.18566199151862356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788784859266146,0.0,0.05178610984079599,0.0,0.09708570996262346,0.0,0.03648210440019792,0.0,0.0,

The features have many comments with the original cast and crew which truly makes it special.  The basis of the film is a Detroit detective get's put on vacation when he and a friend are attacked and the friend ends up being murdered in the process.  Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) heads to Los Angeles due to the fact that, that is where the deceased friend had worked and he wants to uncover his murderer.

937034,B000B7QCG8,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,1,4,1140048000,A fun film to kill some time...3.5 stars,"Obviously this film is bound to draw parallels with the first DnD film as well as Lord of the Rings.  Allow me to state that a comparison with either is really not appropriate.The first DnD film was, well, a disaster.  The characters were unlikable, the plot was awful, and it was an overall horrific film.  Shame on Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch!  Talk about wasted potential... two phenomenal actors, a large budget, and that was the best the folks involved could do?As for LotR... Get over it already!  First of all, DnD =/= LoTR.  Secondly, LotR had a multimillion dollar budget, a cast of big name actors, and several years to shoot, and 8 hours of film to get the viewer drawn into.  This is a small-budget film with a cast of not-so-famous actors made to fit a television schedule.  Finally, this film is based on DnD stereotypes.  Gamers will argue for the next century whether or not the DnD Core characters are somehow related to the characters in LotR.  Personally, I fall on the side of ""no, they are not"".  Even going back to the original back in the 70's, there were enough differences to say that DnD, the game, is at best loosely-inspired by Tolkien.Now, if you watch this as a stand-alone film, it really isn't all that terrible.  The archetypical characters are played to the hilt... the imposing barbarian who hacks her foes, the cleric who provides some sage wisdom and not a bad fight (oh, and for the record, the producers ought to learn...NEVER GET THE PARTY HEALER KILLED!), the roguish thief (I know, I know, repetitive, but it sounds better than saying ""roguish rogue"") who is more concerned with treasure and traps than saving the world, the noble fighter on a quest leading the ragtag group, and the aloof elf caster who really doesn't understand the silly humans but is helping because loss would hurt her race as well.  They were enjoyable characters, with just the right amount of tension to be a believable party of adventurers who were thrust together as opposed to choosing to adventure together.The plot was a typical DnD adventure.  Set up something for a quest, summon adventurers, hack and slash, and then the ending.  Ok, not academy material, but it's not supposed to be!  The effects were a bit better this time around if only because they folks who worked on this film actually put some effort into making this a movie instead of a Saturday morning cartoon like the first one.  A better array of foes and monsters sure to please any gamer.  And how can we forget the ring of the Ram?  A classic little treasure.So, with heaps of praise, why only 3.5 stars?  A few reasons.  It was too short, and at times it felt rushed.  I would have liked to have seen more plot and character development.  While the production was good, I can see why it became a ""SciFi Original"" instead of a theatrical release in the states.  And while I enjoyed it, it's hardly going to get a rating equal to something like ""13th Warrior"" or some of the other fantasy film I *realy* enjoy.It's worth the rental if you missed it on SciFi.",0.25,540,0.0295687895467538,0.0,0.050168613762625,0.0,0.02720245654713943,0.2395750417612429,0.07252339166751935,0.13661547668550397,0.05394219596756309,0.051197462387409666,0.07273254602068338,0.0,0.07109911720053416,0.06309558771010927,0.02818998102521479,0.05991391308422032,0.03509913966531105,0.0,0.0,0.03316273857807706,0.27977323735285947,0.13454941292962388,0.08165095511605829,0.0,0.13378152376823554,0.02739535595331781,0.0,0.03346826549707726,0.0,0.047961609860640735,0.0,0.07203296716171784,0.0,0.0,0.035946735844452765,0.08390220971047865,0.05502533886949648,0.07029391080964424,0.11809298891327934,0.19690533177945202,0.0,0.028850113242002977,0.05488570180137848,0.0,0.0,0.033683860143983974,0.059346456792237955,0.0,0.02184104117283731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033583308827012846,0.165572702755527,0.22887019834579583,0.13544726803691456,0.02410836234806698,0.06666314120533429,0.060018458277904835,0.03436981275003631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09763315186041632,0.03217347769223849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05401566847756499,0.0907414386443823,0.0,0.06699768461499225,0.08060924439920476,0.5538559214956036,0.0,0.0,0.0368199430493109,0.028720581766380725,0.0850650902841566,0.11092802416794996,0.03064769980958677,0.2941182925797015,0.036433543270183597,0.03734716998933646,0.03092607475509885,0.0,0.15315594740155436,0.034727151994046836,0.0,0.03576258698043196,0.09356490803827146,0.173656833030833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1716166386197876,0.031570650150801544,0.1289775010008887,0.06427119709282855,0.04717253614457439,

Things go from bad to worse for him as he has to figure out who robbed the club and try to prove to everyone he is actually a good person now. The filmmakers really tried to go the artistic way with this one, including well over 15 minutes of filming Bautista driving through the cold city, chain-smoking and walking the streets (I finally timed it because it became apparent they were needing filler for the actual 60 minutes of story). Amy Smart plays the love interest, but the ""R"" rating comes strictly from the strippers in the club. Danny Trejo has a few lines but it is always fun to watch him. The special features:* Making of, 9 minutes. Some brief insights spliced into too much film footage to be that informative.* Interviews with cast/crew, 4 @ 8 minutes. Longer takes of what was put into the making of docu. The Trejo one was only 90 seconds but he gives that great story of how he got into acting (the story has been told 100 times - but I love hearing it again anyway).* Commentary with director and Bautista. I did listen to it but will mention why at the end here.5.1 English with subs in Spanish and English. Region 1 coded. The artwork is deceiving as he never carries a gun in the film though he uses one once or twice in self defense. The action is sparse, especially with Bautista so if you are looking for that skip this film; even more frustrating is he continually gets beat down and shoved around while never really handing out any great fighting. This is a solid showing for him on an acting front, but the writing is horrible and that ending is so bad I turned on the commentary to find out why they made it that way - and they did not have any real explanation. Tough investment of time without the fast-forward button and by far the worst ending I have seen with any of these fighter-turned-actor films.",1.0,408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07472646667348663,0.2056638288226272,0.03320421203565284,0.09382233409628721,0.03704545674284583,0.03516047769647269,0.049949957340010634,0.04776236803862951,0.0,0.17332663776497592,0.07743924428135716,0.041146605836936585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045549825157552216,0.19213766099536708,0.0,0.16822434857395552,0.07513936119731876,0.0,0.03762818534617204,0.07771057765059881,0.0,0.1592685449707402,0.06587643352443524,0.36871550726388547,0.0,0.15934821938063284,0.03979869880918726,0.049373712874905794,0.038413906154009234,0.12596439418695116,0.14482558517362012,0.1853755226661392,0.15776497644133802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09361436795825745,0.0,0.0,0.04075689835208133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045948512520660914,0.0,0.0,0.032488302856711476,0.20208777701543773,0.09302005265071979,0.09934025990078901,0.04578172003508074,0.0824368070311197,0.0,0.12057006974296165,0.0,0.0,0.08940100018886069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419182975883339,0.041545188385303654,0.17366941207294004,0.0,0.16607812619975176,0.44863831329132275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11683896311314229,0.08706418834718617,0.08419071691085715,0.22443255722586442,0.050042354672242044,0.0,0.04247771318968749,0.0,0.06010383016861364,0.04769858489896451,0.15145390547785004,0.0,0.04283788959901233,0.04770437377085487,0.04059029739922769,0.0,0.0,0.03928660206421058,0.04336305311738957,0.17715372347844116,0.0,0.0323963108258514,

But the few moments it gets too smug and/or cartoony for it's own good take a tiny something away from the 90% of the time it brilliantly walks the thin, nearly impossible line of perfect satire.  When it tries to be funny, it pushes a little hard.  But when it just observes the absurdity with a clinical, `this isn't too far from reality' eye, it's quite amazing.

379441,6303542360,A243HY69GIAHFI,9,13,961459200,Amazing dialogue heals plot wounds,"Second in a trilogy, TO PLAY THE KING continues the story from HOUSE OF CARDS and lays vital groundwork for THE FINAL CUT, but it lacks the cohesion of those other entrants into this series.  One of TPTK's  subplots-that of the King's newly-out homosexual press secretary-is a  well-written, well-acted part of the story, but  it just fizzles uselessly  at the end, having had little impact..  Likewise, other plots which seem  dreadfully important when introduced simply disappear.  We're told, for  instance, that the publication of the secrets of the King's sister will  assuredly bring down the monarchy.  Urquart orders this publication, yet  the monarchy does not fall. Why?  We're not told.  Worse, the main  plot-that of a confrontation between elected prime minister and hereditary  monarch-- is itself resolved in ways that aren't even shown on-screen.This is not to say that TO PLAY THE KING is uninteresting or in any way  unwatchable.  The acting is phenomenal, the dialogue sparkling, and the  conclusions bold.  The battle between Francis Urquart and the King of  England is mesmerizing stuff.  But this is clearly not the best entrant in  the series, perhaps because it's hard to write about what hasn't happened  in modern times.  With the exception of love, there has been no issue which  has publicly separated a British monarch from his Prime Minister in the  twentieth century, so the film is largely theoretical.  Oddly, the film's  denouement really closes out the two main subplots, not the main storyline.  Consequently, we're left wondering why exactly the chosen ending is  happening.Having said all this, it's still a phenomenal ride.  If you  like political intrigue at all, the only better films are the other parts  of this trilogy.",0.6923076923076923,281,0.04760465639383304,0.0,0.08076961067846217,0.0,0.0,0.09642673675860913,0.03891999180857753,0.0,0.08684493831255136,0.0,0.058548353095221654,0.055984191729221894,0.05723347313363181,0.10158156011619558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05339078126927205,0.09008491072192258,0.0,0.06572750731615538,0.0880738660252293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053882668296810765,0.0933425322511707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046649654868557634,0.0,0.0450264837257449,0.17717751656318187,0.05658529689523991,0.2444468654434957,0.10567009793274391,0.0,0.04644761415198014,0.04418197388597283,0.05486458209260299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05406788379855886,0.19040422939416635,0.2895141428767506,0.03634418110682409,0.03881357077478834,0.053662594577902,0.04831374783011596,0.16600237798359446,0.09421668394995693,0.0,0.0,0.052395253218070904,0.0,0.12880301265827399,0.0,0.0,0.04348161316667729,0.0,0.10178244988951456,0.0,0.1622223736840429,0.6859134824939498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046239073272096184,0.0,0.15307715299738991,0.0,0.10522656920067473,0.0,0.06012756091395771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059175070462403195,0.17272932281513717,0.10042402515079157,0.0,0.047577519399930164,0.04912606771677619,0.10849705814613962,0.0,0.05082757784800214,0.03460816687571977,0.0,0.03797301832118233,

Government agent Cleo fights drug queen Mommy to keep the inner city streets clean. The kung fu fight scenes are very well choreographed(with some great slo-mo). The actors and dialog are damn good mostly with the police cheif, Mommy, and Bill Mckinney (from deliverance) having the best lines. The un-cool drug pushers and pimps get what's coming to them and Jones has no sympathy for them either. Bad cat Shelly Winters tears up all her scenes as the most memorable character ""mommy"", beating the crap out of her sons whenever they fail. The film's decent budget provides for some great widescreen photography, car chases, explosions, and bloody gun battles. Very tall and with a presence, Tamara Dobson impresses by getting her point accross without calling everyone a bitch or MFer throughout the whole movie. 16x9 dvd picture and sound from warner has no flaws. Unfortunately, somebody threw a wrench in the machine on the sequel, and it pales in every way to this brilliant film.",0.0,173,0.0,0.0,0.07448962527929438,0.0,0.0,0.3557175243371231,0.1435755641925967,0.06761488842277381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10556693120952823,0.0,0.08371214453459903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10322497737409388,0.0,0.1661612873115923,0.0,0.12123414609519853,0.16245192274691847,0.0993184266754938,0.08135244912331241,0.16801091406622132,0.0,0.17216995827031367,0.0,0.0,0.3208604939945221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10893442641645013,0.0,0.0,0.09745405397051622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546029955527222,0.06485851813136345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19945602659060704,0.0,0.04854616130270962,0.06703670870737649,0.0,0.0,0.08911453061301748,0.0,0.0868911639357629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17964208442901575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5060659607573385,0.0,0.213135569782237,0.0,0.0,0.08420226943213861,0.047058374512455085,0.0,0.14556751561650413,0.0,0.0,0.09183716858379558,0.17750663887834706,0.0,0.0,0.10914820035886748,0.0,0.09261587297109065,0.0,0.08775655997470841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915039104822441,0.0,0.0,

1266401,B002FLOTYU,A39C66NHY99BR1,21,23,1253664000,The FRIDAY set I've been waiting for since season 1's failure.,"I'm happy to announce that today, I received my copy of FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES - THE FINAL SEASON on DVD.  (The box states there are 19 episodes, but not to fear: ""The Prophecies,"" often seen as a 2-parter, originally aired as a 2-hour episode, and is included uncut in the set.)  I looked at the back cover for evidence of bonus features, and it said, and I quote: ""Special Features: Promos on Selected Episodes""!I've been pretty vocal about my dislike for the previous two season sets, with their near-total lack of extras and, most noticeably, the glaring omissions of the pre-titles sequence from every episode, and for the hardcore fans, the lack of the 30-second promos for the next week's episode.  Leave it to me, a fan of the show from 1988 (not quite the beginning) to notice and be bugged by these things.  So the ""Special Features"" note on this set was something I was too curious about.So far, I've only gone through disc 1, but it appears MY prayers, at least, were answered--to a degree. Not only does ""The Prophecies"" have the opening pre-title sequence (""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil..."") intact, but also, all episodes on the disc have the original 30-second episode promos, very nearly as they appeared during the original airings, complete with the red band across the screen denoting an ""All-New Episode.""Why are they ""very nearly"" as they appeared? Well, do you remember at the very end of the promos, when they showed the tombstone with the F13 logo, the announcer said something like, ""Next week, drive like the devil!""? (Bonus points to the fan who can identify that particular episode!) Well, they edited out that part of the audio from the promo.  CBS/Paramount has them, master and all!  (If they didn't have the masters of the promos, then they would have been unable to separate any audio, as music and dialogue would be on the same ""tracks."")I'm afraid we don't have all the promos--six are missing from this season (""Mightier Than The Sword,"" ""Epitaph For a Lonely Soul,"" ""My Wife as a Dog,"" and ""Jack-in-the-Box,"" as well as those for the component halves of ""The Prophecies""), and definitely we won't see the promos from seasons 1 and 2 on these discs. I have to at least give CBS/Paramount kudos for restoring the promos in this set, and giving us the 30-second opener for the first time in the sets!What about the episodes themselves?  Well, Johnny (introduced in 2 episodes from season 2) is no Ryan (who departs after the first episode in this set), but aside from him, we do have an exciting season where the writers experimented with different types of curses.  If the show hadn't been shut down by parents' groups, we would have likely seen even more of a departure from the previous seasons like in this collection of episodes.Rating: 4 stars.  Not perfect, but this is the set I wish we'd received for seasons 1 and 2, and I'm very happy.",0.9130434782608695,506,0.08252978692887436,0.03463646368587894,0.09335079471322687,0.03202249280557129,0.05061672520677236,0.19503185364782646,0.06747362284609507,0.16947067581682668,0.10037245370132306,0.047632607747333966,0.0,0.09705696385189072,0.0,0.09783712056017262,0.05245425245564717,0.02787106809077259,0.06531040696102125,0.03369228126113074,0.03234052271036544,0.03085363306805968,0.0,0.06259040106533588,0.1709226865106955,0.20358561389262272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026970538464274604,0.17848826429212802,0.0,0.0,0.03597870737383475,0.0,0.0,0.05204009284721356,0.11945255241306535,0.0,0.04708724185294049,0.04579872709821931,0.0,0.0,0.07659605524174717,0.0,0.0,0.03133846919039891,0.02760709579889197,0.03304085212292024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835432227911092,0.031244919213184775,0.0880251172756719,0.19772449979310677,0.12601614001941125,0.0,0.06202141880023519,0.0,0.0,0.02722311723460713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029933253941095042,0.03721654559217144,0.0,0.07267336075435933,0.05025458350518965,0.0,0.0,0.03116633405672765,0.056247346160762,0.7002675289105317,0.0316978684118484,0.033387828751701966,0.03425618815393278,0.02672078149501544,0.18466478107094908,0.08846070796126217,0.02851371523732172,0.12161732336353483,0.033896693205266074,0.034746704536132225,0.0,0.1112261321226802,0.04071193502045563,0.0,0.0,0.16636227639357956,0.11606670475913662,0.03231303828228837,0.027494246964668005,0.028389126949944162,0.0,0.05322235158477028,0.0,0.09999738312091139,0.08969403690583537,0.021943967589827355,

752685,B000096IAJ,A3P3WYB24WLIVH,14,55,1065484800,X-Men meet the Dewey Decimal System,"This OAV was an anime I really looked forward to viewing.  Unfortunately, the promising premise was undercut by flaws too sizable and numerous to overlook.The story focuses mostly on two characters, Yomiko and Nancy.  They`re the only `good guys` who have extraordinary powers, and the nature of these powers is very similar to those displayed by Marvel`s X-men.  First off, we have the main character, Yomiko Readman, aka The Paper.  She can manipulate paper to effects ranging from mundane to deadly (think Magneto`s ability with magnetism).  The combination of the element involved, paper (which is hardly your usual super-hero material), and Yomiko's nebbish, librarian, yet compelling demeanor make for a winning character rather than the feel of a rip-off that might have easily occurred.  Then there`s Nancy Makuhari, aka Miss Deep, who can phase through any and all matter with moves that rival Nadia Comaneci (think Shadowcat, aka Kitty Pride, with Nightcrawler`s gymnastic ability).The first incongruity we come across regarding agent Yomiko is her level of experience with, and working for, British intelligence.  When she first meets Miss Deep, she introduces herself using her real name.  Deep admonishes her for this rookie mistake.  But Yomiko isn`t supposed to be a rookie.  Her familiarity with the upper brass is evident.  She`s a known quantity in British Intelligence and is being tapped for a very important assignment that has implications for international diplomacy as well as military and security objectives.Secondly, the extent of her ability to manipulate paper appears inconsistent.  The show can`t make up its mind if she can control paper that`s simply nearby, or if she has to be in contact with the paper, along with any sheets touching the first.  In one life-and-death situation, she is bound, and cannot manipulate the paper ribbon in her braided hair until she can grasp it with her teeth.  Yet in another scene, she can control pieces of paper floating around her without making contact with them, either directly or via other paper.  The first case itself seems rather odd; since the paper ribbon is in her hair, she is technically already touching it (even though it was tied by Miss Deep).  Perhaps once she has touched a piece of paper, she can manipulate it ever after by proximity (at one point we do see her flipping through a stack of currency). But that still wouldn`t explain the former case above. Even if this is true, why reach for, grab, and then throw paper that she's obviously already touched from a briefcase, instead of just commanding it to fly on it`s own? I`m sure there`s some rational explanation for these apparent variances, but one can't escape the feeling that her ability is dictated by whatever the director needs at the moment to create the desired dramatic effect.Third, is Yomiko a bumbling bookworm, or a ninja warrior?  For the most part, Yomiko behaves as someone more likely than most to trip over or bang into something out of clumsiness, or inattentiveness.  Yet she holds her own in battles with master samurai.  If she doesn`t understand the basics (never give your real name in an operation), how did she manage to hone her martial arts skills to such a degree?There are some problems in directing as well.  In one shot involving the Statue of Liberty, everything happens in normal speed?except for Yomiko, who is suspended in mid-air, coat flapping, seemingly going slow motion, left-to-right in a straight line.  There`s nothing to keep her from falling, which she eventually does in the next shot.  I`m surprised this got passed the editing process.The show also has the rather annoying habit of shuttling you from place to place without any indication of travel, or identification of the new location.  With a little thought, one can suss out soon enough what has happened, but time has to be spent wondering exactly where you are now? Japan, Britain, or Washington?One other thing that bothers me. The story seems reluctant to define the era in which it takes place. There are steam powered contraptions from the 1800s, clothes from the 1920s, conveyance systems from the 40s, manual typewriters from the 50s, James Bond style music from the 70s, computer monitors and satellite imagery from the 90s, genetic replication technology that hasn?t been invented yet, just to name a few.  Half way through the first episode, I found myself wishing that they would choose a time period and stick with it.Yet even given all this, it`s definitely not a complete waste of time.  As others have pointed out, the story is engaging enough, the characters interact in an interesting manner, and the artwork is very pleasant. Yomiko`s character has a child-like sincerity that`s devoid of cynicism, coupled with a hard-core tenacity to accomplish her mission.  It`s a difficult combination that comes off in spades and saves the show.  We quickly come to really like and care about Yomiko.Even though Read or Die has been somewhat overhyped, it is still worth a look.  I would recommend seeing it before buying.  This anime had the potential to be an immediate buy-off-the-shelf keeper, but the gaps and incontinuites lessened what should have been an excellent show.",0.2545454545454545,861,0.018858318161460413,0.023743625537496007,0.031996429159166256,0.021951723618442782,0.0867456172881409,0.1623453760613311,0.04625381069630008,0.07260860084248455,0.03440313619452275,0.0653052119860734,0.0,0.06653347253937769,0.0,0.06706827738868344,0.08989472333631524,0.17195294215686285,0.022385452808454196,0.0,0.0,0.0846018365712063,0.0,0.1287189470566167,0.11716912849931979,0.17444984514464199,0.0,0.0174721504205384,0.0,0.021345317435403847,0.14790848665106576,0.07647212755003506,0.0,0.3445577161778437,0.0,0.0,0.022926030852523895,0.07134795796168518,0.19886566404688505,0.02241594862660054,0.16139376240732375,0.12558185341044817,0.02411500564027762,0.03679992470788066,0.03500488328914597,0.0,0.0,0.021482818919488812,0.018924926943217648,0.04529963724710369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015085513935851206,0.16682095583083814,0.028795087814939724,0.09225467281156244,0.02125813646352953,0.15311376611821112,0.04384060855552751,0.05598511794771258,0.0,0.0,0.04151217255565217,0.020519530490807427,0.0,0.4151738195106157,0.09963656105033336,0.0,0.03858191799788588,0.060480821688632815,0.04272963729384094,0.15423236469299575,0.4256958991037898,0.0,0.02288767440521511,0.04696588608152803,0.09158675025845084,0.036168418606279965,0.060640657304466994,0.058639269593256174,0.22926704008418775,0.023236505831666265,0.02381919668965194,0.019723964563872078,0.05718492919172469,0.04186262844841163,0.0,0.023441872928871784,0.09123433916528773,0.03978241543601324,0.0,0.03769513598645238,0.019461016740883984,0.0644707534019959,0.054726642897825965,0.0,0.17822781063394527,0.04099074402345816,0.030085597304913645,

The plot surrounds survivors of a U-boat attack on their passenger boat that leaves them floating on the ocean with little food and water. Then, they pick up a Nazi U-Boat survivor in the water whose boat attacked them, but was also sunk by an American destroyer.Half of the passengers want to throw the Nazi overboard, but the other half don't. As the story progresses with a storm approaching and one of the passengers needing an amputation because of his wounds, tension builds between the passengers and the Nazi. Before long, the passengers voluntarily relinquish the control of the boat to the leadership of the Nazi whe seems to know the direction to row to get help in Bermuda. In reality, the Nazi is rowing the boat to one of the Nazi supply ships taking him to safety, and taking them to captivity, but where they can finally get much needed food and water of which they ran out.Without revealing the exciting end, the passengers all realize that some people do not deserve mercy or cannot be trusted.

1209455,B001KVZ6FW,AB2G52VQUY8PZ,5,25,1355097600,Pixar jumps the shark,"Well, everybody has to jump the shark sometime, right? The A-Team had Stockwell, MASH had Alan Alda as a director, Firefly had the entire fourth disc (The last four episodes have their moments, but let's be honest: They're not anywhere near as well written as the episodes on the previous discs. The Bounty Hunter and the Brothel villains were so 2 dimensional you could use them to split atoms and not initiate a nuclear event.).And Pixar has Up. WARNING: THE FOLLOWING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.Savvy credit-watchers will note that Up does not boast the involvement of John Lasseter at all, and Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird except in the role of ""Executive Producers."" ""Executive Producer"" is a Hollywood term that means ""I'll give you some money and take the credit for your success, but I'm not doing any work.""This is understandable. Lasseter, Stanton and Bird have been practically living in the studio since Toy Story. They have families, and they've made a pile of money. I don't blame them one bit for wanting to spend more time with their kids. Unfortunately, like Jim Henson's death, they took all the magic with them and what remained was only someone trying desperately to imitate what was uniquely inimitable.Like all Pixar movies, Up is technically impressive. The visuals are stunning in some places, and the animation is exquisite (whoever researched the dogs earned his money.) Unlike Pixar movies, however, the writing leans too heavily on sight gags and shies away from character exploration almost entirely. It's like a Dreamworks movie got lost and Pixar kidnapped it. (Hey-yoh!)There are a lot of things wrong with the movie, but I think the fundamental problem is the lack of empathy. Every other Pixar movie has been the manifestation of some passion or affection that men like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird had for something. Toys and Finding Nemo were about their kids. Cars was about their parents. Ratatouille was about their own passion for creation. No matter what the movie, either Bird or Stanton (or both) were speaking through the main characters. It's why the movies were so good, why the characters rang so true. They were honest.The creative heads behind Up not only fail to empathize with the main character, they don't even seem to like him at all. Let's have a look at what happens to the main character through the course of the movie.1) He meets the love of his life in a decrepit, run-down old house, and falls through the ceiling and breaks his arm. (They later buy the house and fix it up as a married couple)2) He marries the love of his life, and they attempt to have children but an apparent miscarriage leaves her barren. (I say ""apparent"" because that scene is part of a musical montage of their relationship that takes up about 10 minutes of the first reel.)3) During the musical montage, they decide to follow their childhood dreams by setting up a savings jar to go exploring, but on three occasions, they have to use the money in the savings jar to pay for emergencies.4) During the musical montage, the main character buys plane tickets to the Amazon so they can fulfill their dreams of being explorers in their retirement.5) But before he can present the tickets to her, she has a heart attack and dies. During the musical montage.6) The neighborhood around the house he and his wife rebuilt from the ground has gone commercial. Surrounded by glass and steel monoliths, he is the last holdout and won't sell to the developer.7) A construction worker backs over his mailbox, which he and his wife hand painted during the musical montage, and though well meaning won't let the old man repair it himself.8) The old man gets evicted from his house after hitting the construction worker who wouldn't let him have his mailbox over the head with his cane.9) The old man flies his house to the Amazon, following the footsteps of the childhood hero he and his wife shared, and the reason why they wanted to explore the amazon in the first place.10) Only it turns out that his childhood hero is a homicidal lunatic who sets his house on fire and subsequently tries to kill him.So in the course of the movie, he loses his wife, his house, and his childhood hero. But it's all okay because he helped a small, annoying kid rescue a large, annoying bird.Furthermore, nobody in the movie listens to the main character or seems to care about him at all. The land developers won't listen to him. The guys from the old folk's home won't listen to him. The annoying kid that accidentally tagged along on the trip to the Amazon won't listen to him. His childhood hero won't listen to him. The talking dog, who is the lone bright spot in the movie, won't listen to him. The only person in the movie who gave a rat's rear end what the main character thought about anything was killed off in the first ten minutes.His character isn't even well written. When we initially meet him, he's shy. Almost timid. Under his wife's influence, he's happy. But after her death, he turns into cranky old coot stereotype number 7, Asner variant. Sure, his house is surrounded by skyscrapers and construction workers, but his transformation from mousey balloon vendor to crusty old fart is so sudden that I can't help but wonder if the only contact the writers had with old people came from watching Abe Vigoda and Wolford Brimley movies. Memo to Pixar: Not every old person living alone is perpetually cranky.And he's not the only character who's taken directly from the Saturday Morning TV School of Character Stereotypes. The other primary character is a chubby boy scout who is seeking his ""helping the elderly"" merit badge. He's your standard annoying, wise-beyond-his-years preadolescent whose innocence will show the old man the error of his ways. At one point, the kid is talking about his estranged father (Aww! He lacks a father figure. And look! The main character lacks a son! I wonder where this is going...) he remarks that what he really remembers is the little, boring, everyday stuff that he did get to do, not the big, important stuff that he didn't. That thud you hear is the message being delivered like a sack of tainted meat into a dumpster. Pardon me while I gag myself with a screwdriver.The villains aren't particularly fleshed out either. The land developer has no dialog, and exists primarily as a man with a cell phone who stands in for corporate soullessness (lessness... lessness... lessness.) I won't harp on him, because he's not really supposed to be a fleshed out villain, though I will point out that Pixar has done the Corporate Villain so much better in both Monster's Inc and The Incredibles.The other villain, which you could see coming from the start of the movie if you pay close enough attention, is the main character's childhood hero. A celebrated explorer, he is disgraced when scientists dispute his findings of a seven foot tall bird that roams the remotest regions of the Amazon rainforest. He sets out for the rainforest, vowing to return only when he has positive proof that he's not a liar. When we find him next, he is not merely bitter at his mistreatment at the hands of the press, but downright bat-guano insane. It is strongly intimated that he murdered any explorer/archaeologist/botanist who he ever encountered in the rainforest because he suspected them of trying to capture his bird and steal his glory.The main problem with the villain is that the writers think that ""bat-guano-insane"" is a substitute for personality. Every other villain in a Pixar movie has had human motivations, and has been sympathetic to some degree. Even the Aussie dentist in Finding Nemo was more clueless than evil. This guy is just completely inhuman, and not in the ""I believe what I was programmed to believe"" way that the Wheel was in Wall-E. He's just... one-dimensional. It's like someone said ""Oh, let's just make him a hunter who kills people. That's good enough, right?"" and everyone just nodded.The one character, or group of characters, that are well written and fully realized are the dogs. The villain has an enormous pack of dogs at his command, and he has outfitted them with collars that translate their thoughts into English. This opens up the inevitable ""I would like that ball!"" and ""SQUIRREL!"" jokes that actually work. They're the only thing in the movie that does.I'd be more willing to forgive the cardboard characters if the rest of the movie wasn't taken whole cloth from the clich&eacute; factory as well. The whole denouement is so laughably derivative I would accuse it of being brilliant parody if they weren't taking themselves so seriously. The villain sets the main character's house on fire as a distraction, because the main character is defending the large bird. Seeing his whole life go up in flames, the old man rushes to extinguish the flames, leaving the villain open to waltz off with the bird. How the main character was supposed to stop the villain, who at the time was flanked by his army of vicious dogs and carrying a rifle that acts like a shotgun, isn't discussed. But the annoying kid is very disappointed at the main character for just letting the bird go.After the kid yells at the old man for acting like a human being instead of some paragon of selfless giving (+1), the old man reverts to full on grouch mode and takes his house to finish what he set out to do in the first place. And he does it, by jiminy. The house sets down right where he and his wife planned to build their retirement home.But it's all hollow. We know this, because as he puts the furniture back where it belongs and rehangs the pictures on the walls the score plays sad music, and the color scheme is just slightly muted, even the photograph of his wife seems to look down on him in disappointment. All that was missing was him looking at a mirror with a melancholy expression, only to turn away in disgust at what he had become. And quite frankly, I'm not altogether certain he didn't. By this point in the movie my eyes were rolling so much I'm sure I missed some things.When the kid shows up and steals some balloons so he can chase after the bird himself, the main character finally ""gets it."" He expunges the house of everything inside, so the withering balloons could lift what remained skyward once more. The last we see of the furniture, as the house flies away, is his chair sitting neatly next to his wife's chair on the ground as the triumphal music swells and eggs the old man onward and upward. (Yeah! You dump that old crappy symbol of the life you had with your wife. Forget her, it's time to go save some kid you don't know and a bird you don't like!) He chases after the villain, who has captured the annoying child and left him tied to a chair and ready to drop from the loading dock of his blimp to the ground so many thousands of feet below. The villain and the main character have a climactic battle that employs a clumsy version of the ""I threw my back out"" joke that was so much better in The Incredibles. See, it's funny because they're both so old. Also old people smell like prunes.Seriously. That's how the dogs find him as he sneaks aboard the villain's airship. They smell prunes. They couldn't even spare the cash for some additional syllables and use the word ""liniment.""Needless to say, the kid is rescued. The villain was dispatched through the use of a high-fall the likes of which I haven't seen since I watched every movie that ever came out between 1985 and 1999.Finally, we're treated to a scene where the annoying kids finally gets his helping the elderly merit badge, with the main character standing by his side because the kid's father couldn't be there (all together now: Awwww!) and then they go share ice cream and count different color cars, just like the kid used to do with his dad (and again: Awwwwww!) and apparently the court order remanding the old man to a home has been rescinded, or at least it's unenforceable because he now lives in the villain's airship.Oh, and just to throw a bone to those of us who understood why it was important to the main character to keep a promise he made to his wife so many years ago, the last we see of the house, it just happened to land right where he wanted to put it. What a coincidence.I suppose Up was an accurate enough title for the movie, given the infatuation with flight. But if they wanted to make it more accurate and a whole lot more descriptive they would have called it ""Trite.""That's not something I ever thought I'd be able to say about a Pixar movie. Usually they come right up to the edge of being trite without actually falling off the precipice. This one just points the car at the edge of the cliff and lays down rubber.I have more complaints, like about how this movie is a violent departure from Pixar's classical themes about how nostalgia is a good and fundamentally human emotion, and the fact that it's not only okay, but admirable that people have attachments to physical objects. Heck, if the people who made Up had done Cars, the residents of Radiator Springs would just pack up and move to California, because it's just a road, right? Move on.But I'm running long, so I won't. In conclusion, I just want to say that I will no longer buy a Pixar movie on DVD just because Pixar did it. It was my last vestige of fanboy mentality, and Up snuffed it out. I don't know whether I should be angry or grateful.",0.2,2363,0.06640651621678789,0.04180466786066154,0.05070161178428333,0.0077299443034833035,0.018327639374392992,0.22194362561456002,0.021716708095205334,0.056249476828706395,0.09085880838033131,0.03449426068908349,0.08983976987105205,0.031238247831839823,0.0,0.07557442799573563,0.044316961314879735,0.026911309538373,0.023648025060623443,0.04066508175786418,0.007806713887470006,0.03723895991237731,0.0,0.030217529728575856,0.0550122838115233,0.0675726594947232,0.007511268692259717,0.01845760523780115,0.0,0.06764767359748344,0.09114626584552947,0.05924252935267533,0.28804356240807477,0.032354779991277095,0.14764396696392,0.27981961383576526,0.032292123328495334,0.03768604352879181,0.11533912524152627,0.023680240887479387,0.1250308447414211,0.0994986400997072,0.0,0.0907094865606426,0.08628482301197937,0.015306762138216851,0.016601076434757018,0.007564827100408162,0.04664874778532689,0.0,0.09319746281227424,0.03221738523682623,0.022538942486016025,0.019616825617183514,0.022626734909538367,0.0796817948379102,0.16521553268380848,0.06590820783824627,0.02707165866048901,0.07485708808800486,0.06065610235705894,0.03087552196405443,0.05914276041579388,0.04268944156408507,0.0,0.014617839917690372,0.028902482663239852,0.0,0.008599808424704812,0.00877135072508177,0.10311357200428167,0.06113699183402365,0.007099114268628613,0.0075232752136131405,0.16293129545459653,0.6283123168371667,0.08416741155520281,0.04029762114896826,0.008269138448630557,0.012900316908874814,0.13372929595084737,0.028471501775913857,0.020648870030961473,0.24219803619242594,0.008182359572687028,0.0,0.10418212494793504,0.0067122491963727575,0.08353373464396292,0.0,0.008254676273223153,0.04819004461136759,0.042026201804042866,0.04680047634922845,0.07300552736254654,0.03426441087519049,0.02270233270349399,0.08350810799352186,0.035451178816413596,0.0772431259951624,0.02886845459310224,0.04767370343934217,

It takes place seven years after the first film and a horribly disfigured man and his aid are interrogating a man who was an employee at the asylum where Hannibal Lecter was kept. The disfigured and crippled man is a wealthy man who in his younger days was a child molester.  Hannibal ( Anthony Hopkins) was appointed as his court appointed therapist and Hannibal left him disfigured and wheel chair bound.The disfigured man is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) and he is trying to find out all he can about Hannibal and Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore).  At the end of the interview the asylum worker offers to sell Mason a piece of Hannibal Lecter memorabilia and he sells Hannibal's face mask for $250,000.Agent Starling is managing a huge bust of a drug ring and the apprehension of a female habitual criminal.  When the woman walks out of the warehouse she is guarded by three men and carrying a baby in a shoulder harness.  Starling calls off the bust but one of the local cops draws his gun and a street war breaks out.  The entire operation looks bad as Starling is shown carrying away a baby covered in blood and 5 people are killed.  Since she was in charge she takes the blame for the embarrassment to the FBI and other federal agencies involved in the bust that has gone bad.Mason Verger uses his wealth and influence at the justice department to get Starling reassigned to the recapture Hannibal Lecter.  His goal is to capture and kill Lecter as revenge for his torture, disfigurement and his being crippled......This is a very good movie for many reasons but unfortunately it is a sequel to a super top rated Silence of the Lambs film and it was not rated as highly as it should have been because of that.  This movie is well filmed and the cinematography is just spectacular from the scenes outside of the Verger mansion to the scenes shot in Italy.  It is also a detailed and macabre story and may be too intense for some people.The acting in this film is top notch and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling did a wonderful job of replacing Jodie Foster in this role.  Every actor in this movie plays their role to perfection and this is what made this movie first class.I enjoyed this story and the movie for many reasons.  It is really a good film and worth watching.  I recommend it to you.  Just be aware it is gruesome and has several horrific scenes in it.  It is not for the weak of heart.",0.0,447,0.03275410794088469,0.04123916391189277,0.027786531265125345,0.03812689544905109,0.03013286007509386,0.4146616086840284,0.053557349609255414,0.1513324738125328,0.08962973474934925,0.056712744587838586,0.04028385503251629,0.03851959866513534,0.0,0.046595069150705486,0.03122676631356202,0.033184090495459256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15495600184675712,0.11178288142750652,0.15828200670704481,0.030299356545036286,0.037048307837155625,0.060693079407603975,0.0,0.0,0.06422378835248604,0.026564153799905735,0.09912108594175832,0.0,0.04283727762117077,0.2567761974087383,0.0,0.0,0.20317660574341534,0.0,0.3363804981726281,0.18176424618944015,0.0,0.06391602346394015,0.0,0.0,0.08188254413223454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096941252621517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052402610621808045,0.21730748524216556,0.0,0.026705452429087926,0.0,0.0,0.03807232470381171,0.09723786504408678,0.08422393804616697,0.0,0.03605025032208825,0.0,0.0,0.1272521445760624,0.0,0.0,0.03350554105221575,0.07003082477034166,0.0,0.044646465623997274,0.471938796445664,0.03774038836495766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15798577195095637,0.0,0.19910146053085467,0.04035837202782951,0.0,0.0,0.03310725320786059,0.14541838133695364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03454808425077992,0.0,0.032735436489501175,0.03380090618435693,0.0,0.06336805341001227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02612711518477261,
1650175,B00CPTUOBO,AYG1U47VFZ165,0,1,1376784000,Faith & Family Collide in RAISING IZZIE,"Despite what you may think, families don't exactly have a slew of entertainment choices when it comes to finding both palatable and inoffensive programming on the boob tube these days.  Sure, there's a wealth of reality programming, but most of those seem to be populated by characters you wouldn't exactly want to live with much less have you child taking his or her lifestyle cues from.  Heck, even some of the cartoons on any given channel seem to be written more for adults than kids these days, so what's a mom and dad to do when they want to provide their children with something of substance?  Of quality?  Of values?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Gertrude and Izzie Nash are sisters sharing a secret: their mother passed away from cancer over a year ago, and, instead of being split apart by the state's protective services and placed in different families, they've managed to stay off anyone's radar by living alone in an apartment set-up by their ailing mother.  However, an accidental fire throws their lives into chaos, but a chance encounter with Gerty's teacher (played by Vanessa Williams) and her faith-conscious husband (the affable and reliable Rockmond Dunbar) presents them with a chance they never imagined they'd have again: a family.RAISING IZZIE is the kind of film that doesn't seem to find much of an audience these days.  Flicks involving family values and issues of faith struggle to find respectable viewership - if they find any at all - especially when so many channels are overflowing with gritty adult dramas or reality schlock.  That's so surprising to me because, despite what Hollywood would have you believe, the themes at the story's core remain part and parcel of the mainstream American experience - who doesn't want a loving, caring mother or father?If anything, that could be because so many family films are populated by somewhat safe, saccharin choices, and IZZIE is no different.  The presentation has a decidedly `tender' perspective, not one uncommon to the series of `AfterSchool Specials' one network produced in the 1980's.  The scripted dialogue remains tame, the performances aren't anything necessarily cutting edge (though charming), and it's all packaged and promoted with bright lights and big suburbs.  I think the reality of situations involving broken families like that explored here is probably a bit less Hollywood and a bit more `back alley,' and those sentiments wouldn't quite `gel' with IZZIE's sunny skies and squeaky-clean interiors.Still, there's solid charm and some wonderful acting chops on young stars Victoria Elizabeth Staley and her screen-sister Kyla Kenedy.  It's refreshing to find two young actresses who, if they apply themselves, can hopefully enjoy a teenage future void of sex, drugs, and violence (I'm talking about you, Lindsay Lohan); putting them alongside Dunbar (whom I've liked in everything he's done) was a stroke of inspiration.  He plays a terrific father-in-training who has to overcome his own personal struggles when he suddenly finds himself trapped as the only adult influence in their young lives; when he turns to his faith to find the strength he needs to carry on, it feels richly authentic if not a bit formulaic for the needs of David Conely's script.RAISING IZZIE (2012) is produced by Bobbcat Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by RLJ Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the telefilm looks and sounds very solid consistently.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that IZZIE has been nominated for a total of nine different awards in several different film competitions (Black Reel, Image, MovieGuide, and NAMIC Vision Awards), and it's won two - the Epiphany Award for Most Inspiring TV Program and the young Kyla Kenedy won the Grace Award for Most Inspiring Television Acting.  Unfortunately, the disc comes with no special features.RECOMMENDED.  About the best that can be said for harmless entertainment the likes of RAISING IZZIE is that it's a pleasant enough experience.  That isn't a bad thing - it's certainly family friendly, contains solid messages about family and faith, and boasts a few modest tugs on a viewer's heartstrings.  Unfortunately, it never overcomes its `AfterSchool Special' storytelling sensibilities, and those limitations will always keep smaller pictures from finding larger audiences.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of RAISING IZZIE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",0.0,787,0.07765353792550649,0.0,0.043917594770280136,0.03013045291986197,0.0714390755769757,0.35390915744529733,0.06348696301816598,0.03986438727615002,0.09444197580310101,0.11204562164282876,0.06367005669841315,0.03044079357635513,0.031120076712822586,0.03682257683999251,0.2220975353623648,0.05244862790876714,0.030725780064406977,0.0317015823991263,0.06085938423624909,0.029030654927717885,0.048982687557478116,0.0,0.1786930757325829,0.07183380591023562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07613097559473288,0.08397116796394734,0.13055364977743342,0.0945864682511718,0.0,0.07609572293891417,0.0,0.1713786156341629,0.12845112263493655,0.030767637953513196,0.08861021110319937,0.11491392619980928,0.03309972623271094,0.0,0.024023466362859014,0.0,0.06470912755620693,0.05897368929114598,0.0519518767806805,0.09326592829917657,0.0,0.0,0.0585695074268827,0.025488059486161372,0.05879764408434594,0.04141208912034673,0.35777308446497325,0.11857051220375366,0.0422089114595494,0.029178450449341743,0.07881022012660269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03501761657386413,0.0,0.0,0.09457061144514949,0.05295669187528432,0.027671548441461132,0.029324880067348968,0.15877196309987116,0.39782183909488467,0.1491250443308733,0.06283023675936604,0.06446434202689119,0.0502839834303848,0.14893192711575576,0.013872338695738827,0.0,0.28607899594930064,0.0,0.06538741074924312,0.027072679850318356,0.026163591929964484,0.019153240955633873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07760927159223463,0.13355881726554067,0.0,0.10015544813739576,0.055273882053728046,0.16936031909038893,0.028131496742954468,0.16517931601508234,

The movie takes place in Amsterdam. TJ, Deuce's former he-pimp, is wrongly accused of  being a serial man-whore killer. The whole movie then centers around Deuce going undercover as a he-bitch once again in order to find out if one of the she-johns is at the bottom of the murders.There were some really funny antectdotes that pay homage to the hilarity of the original Deuce: The Man-Whore of the Year award known as the ""Golden Boner,"" and the cliche jokes about Asian men and weiner size.I did laugh out loud at some ridiculous points, but it kind of fell flat, because movies like these are NOT about the story line. It's about the cleverness and intelligence of the jokes, which, I have to say, were not as brilliant and ridiculous as the original Deuce.",0.75,164,0.21908116699689775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14792167838939543,0.05970450421482615,0.22493595834495947,0.13322289508743718,0.0,0.08981503416900513,0.0,0.0,0.05194311374246303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05041404243978489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08265772542439277,0.0,0.05922621802911921,0.14733054906722895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907205686487503,0.13589797033420217,0.0,0.12499641983442682,0.08105064408076484,0.0,0.0,0.06777655193424394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08770928304830923,0.1618247098348943,0.17714683129967101,0.0,0.0719085564661755,0.0,0.11683445538525887,0.3229991965176715,0.0,0.11908250193439593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1445313871509455,0.0,0.0,0.08037598342725678,0.0,0.0,0.0945718469094947,0.0,0.0,0.14940483288040415,0.15613751252343733,0.0,0.09954171050183507,0.6313278472613767,0.0,0.0,0.09093547865447348,0.07093220776205555,0.0,0.039137536184818494,0.0,0.12106567574422229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05403635806469506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17155449927915434,0.0,0.0,0.083218967481319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
594318,B00005JL3A,A16EFRMJOKEI0B,8,10,1017014400,A good (not great) movie on many levels,"Resident evil is a movie that will be liked by several different audiences.  There are aspects that will be liked and disliked by horror movie fans, as well as fans of the game.  For a movie based on a video game, it was very well done.  For the most part the story stayed true to the video game's plot.  Some of the characters from the game were missing which I'm sure will upset more than a few.  But all in all, the feel of the video game runs true.  There was a scene where Milla Jovovich wakes up in the shower with a temporary case of amnesia.  She starts looking through the drawers in the room and you can almost picture ""There is nothing of interest here"" printed across the bottom of the screen.  For the horror fans in general there are some nice shock tactics used at times and the creatures are really well done.  It's very worth seeing.As plot goes, the premise for the movie is better than the final movie turned out to be.  The main story revolves around an artificial intelligence system that exterminates the entire staff of an underground biochemical lab when one of there super-virus' secrets is compromised.  A team of soldiers, sent in by the Umbrella Corporation, is sent in to uncover why the A.I. system malfunctioned and to shut it down.  A single agent (Milla Jovovich) and her partner/husband, were in charge of guarding the secret entrance to the underground lab and are both left with no short term memory about the incident.  As the story is told the plot twists somewhat, but the overall feel of the movie is that it's been done before.  Several of the characters line up to be ""next to die"" in a series of creative deaths that parallel ""The House on Haunted Hill.""  The one outstanding thing that I did like about the story was the way the movie ended.  I won't give away anything, but the way the ending was filmed left you craving for a sequel.  At the same time, it didn't feel like this particular movie ended early either.The special effects alone, make up for any monotony in the story-line.  There are several shots that reminded me of ""The Matrix"" and ""Swordfish.""  The living dead dogs were very realistic looking and the zombies makeup and costume design was very good.  Milla Jovovich was absolutely beautiful in her role and her supporting cast was very well chosen, although without a lot of star appearances.The scenery throughout the movie gave it a very creepy feel.  Even though the movie takes place in a high tech office building, it gave off a very haunted house feel to the picture.  Marilyn Manson's scored songs added greatly to the eeriness and would be a great addition to any haunted house.All in all a good movie to see, but not necessarily one to watch again and again.  And in my mind, if you combined the start of ""House on Haunted Hill"" with the ending of ""Resident Evil"" you'd have a near perfect horror movie.The Breakdown:1.  Plot- 8 (solid story with a few twists)2.  Characters- 7 (nice main character, but supporting cast was very cookie cutter in nature)3.  Flow- 8 (movie seemed to be moving on a different time frame than the characters were)4.  Atmosphere- 10 (very creepy scenery and music)5.  Cinematography- 10 (awesome special effects)6.

In this film, aside from some of the action sequences, there is very little to enjoy. This films has too many holes in the script to be believable that will generally insult the intellegence of the viewer. If you are an 'Arnie' fan, probably renting the video would be a viable option. However, without such devotion, I would recommend a 'pass' on this one. Wait for a free TV viewing, and only if you have some time to kill. Recommendation from Howie is One star (probably  star is that option was available).",0.7142857142857143,113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10132022217668492,0.055771149788377966,0.09004194338142736,0.0,0.0,0.3813874864562781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10420634812359629,0.0,0.07603075202933757,0.2037601163184047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107974624524287,0.08932062732295068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079246265800104,0.0,0.20833879504593145,0.13663421781885693,0.0,0.18851040981959447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13766296234733322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12178090978045732,0.08408276943017684,0.1795914736736553,0.1241491603196856,0.11177452883494983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12121714842389422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22532138370539084,0.0,0.0,0.2251822332075645,0.37026975991608957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069747403353301,0.0,0.17707306325978436,0.11415262252254997,0.2434431341298705,0.13570299036860528,0.0,0.0,0.22264293812938044,0.0814936621179005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11759030961040094,0.0,0.2393891139104378,0.17570221404539235,

492907,B000005YSI,A31QEAZMJWBF28,4,4,1138665600,Sheer Magic,"This videotape presents REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT by Rod Serling, starring Jack Palance, Kim Hunter, Keenan Wynn, and Ed Wynn.  REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT is neither a movie nor a play; it is a television drama - a play created specifically for the TV medium.  It was produced in 1956, a time when the television drama was a popular genre.  Dramatically, REQUIEM is in a tradition of ""prizefight dramas,"" earlier examples of which are Clifford Odets' play GOLDEN BOY and Howard Sackler's play THE GREAT WHITE HOPE.  Because it is a brutally competitive contact sport prone to corruption, prizefighting has always been a useful vehicle for playwrights and filmmakers to explore such human themes as uncontrolled rage, the drive for fast success, material versus ""spiritual"" satisfaction, loss of personal identity, and the fine line between a healthy ego and an inflated one.  But unlike Odets' and Sackler's works, Serling's has a hopeful rather than a tragic ending.  The production - broadcast LIVE, as TV dramas usually were - is a shining example of the sheer magic that happens when a great script, great direction, a talented cast, and first-rate production values all converge during a live performance.  Watch REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT and experience the magic of the theatre in your own home.(Incidentally, the video begins with a 1984 mini-documentary featuring interviews with Mrs. Rod Serling and members of the cast and production team and hosted by another icon of the TV drama era, Jack Klugman.)",1.0,246,0.0,0.0,0.06837518172712956,0.0,0.07414886600756192,0.4489631157823768,0.06589511798747599,0.12412950839885178,0.0,0.0,0.09912773502515909,0.09478637450837081,0.0,0.057328967951575736,0.15368135022453866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168920436860264,0.33384810594946374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23132973360410192,0.0,0.15803747354810863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499888979432645,0.0,0.22992832063291993,0.13418188020067306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05953463918171977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31192891790596616,0.0,0.06571493741055351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131164920207105,0.05493147329883325,0.4645257900406665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04319561142921778,0.08353996201346758,0.08907911937647955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11927851129872913,0.09465979425676527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467128250999712,0.0,0.16634988231134554,0.0918477383422555,0.0,0.0,0.11718960532274388,0.0,0.0,

It's one of my favorites and I'm a huge fan of both David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone. So why am I giving this product one star? Because the DVD itself is the worst quality DVD I own. The packaging looks like something you'd find at a dollar store. The DVD has no features, just chapter selection, which happens to be its biggest and most egregious fault. The menu itself looks about the same quality as projects I did in high school.Imagine my excitement watching one of my favorite films, which I finally own, when for unknown reasons after the first chapter the movie stops and switches to the chapter selection screen. A minor fault with the disk or possibly the DVD player? No. I resume the film and it continues to stop the movie after each and every chapter, returning to the chapter selection screen, forcing me to pick up the remote and select the next chapter. As much as I want to become immersed in this awesome world of violence, women, and lovably bad special effects, I can't.DO NOT purchase this DVD. While Death Race 2000 may be a fantastic movie, this abhorrent DVD quality is simply impossible to overlook.",0.75,212,0.06535917417176433,0.16458135276832922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26477963964202655,0.0,0.15098816813464622,0.05961720847376484,0.11316742797469116,0.08038440558760711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06231144081202406,0.06621718272220267,0.07758352025323263,0.0,0.46101533561668057,0.0,0.061841380824300254,0.07435237161527108,0.045120539921689545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407766892135497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108573853623992,0.0,0.07458115078345338,0.07254028133714573,0.08357780584151127,0.06377060424734936,0.06065997625475413,0.0753267442408436,0.0,0.14891034199739134,0.0,0.07849975950670643,0.19311070030120575,0.0,0.07394488530722866,0.193074354032518,0.14846582254699417,0.05228338626818043,0.14454205054629843,0.0,0.15986815941976593,0.0,0.06633272663907562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0596984106915705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044544887745669906,0.5022560638964845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17514036550162498,0.0,0.25282532893896403,0.0,0.0,0.06835933216581122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06744800739052521,0.14896185914738003,0.0,0.0,0.04751554528368952,0.0,0.05213534360481741,

These contain some of the best episodes of the show, where Batman comes across villains such as Mr. Freeze and Catwoman.The episodes in this DVD are:14) Heart of Ice - An evildoer is stealing equipment from various GothCorp facilities and using a freezing gun to freeze anyone who comes in his way. Batman uses the clues and discovers the next area where the attacker may appear, and finds out that Mr. Freeze is behind all this. Freeze escapes from Batman, but doesn't plan on killing him since his main intention is revenge on Ferris Boyle, CEO of GothCorp. Batman tries to find out what is the reason for Freeze's doings, to stop him.This is the first episode to have Mr. Freeze in it, and it is a terrific episode. You really feel sorry for Victor Fries, but at the same time hatred for Mr. Freeze. The way in which Batman tries to capture Freeze is entertaining. (5/5)15 & 16) The Cat and the Claw Parts I and II - There is a new cat burglar in Gotham, and Batman finds out that it is a woman. The two of them form a relationship, but Batman loses her. Meanwhile, there is a new terrorist in town by the name of Red Claw whom Batman is looking for as well. Red Claw is after a plague that she wants for her mission. Later, Bruce Wayne also falls for Celina Kyle, a wildlife activist who is trying to buy land for a wildlife preserve, but has to fight with MutiGon Corp. (who is planning on building a resort there). Can Batman fight his feelings for Catwoman and Celina Kyle by going after her? Will they be able to stop Red Claw from destroying Gotham?This is one of my favorite episodes. The chemistry between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Celina Kyle/Catwoman is great to watch. The storyline was very intriguing, where Batman had to face fighting two women. (5/5)17) See No Evil - This episode starts off with an invisible man walking through the window to see a young girl called Kimberly. The girl refers to him as Mojo, and is happy that he brought her a necklace. However, she is sad that she will not see him again because they are planning to move. Now, the invisible man, Lloyd Ventrix makes sure that his daughter Kimmy is not taken away from him. He steals jewelry from a Jewelry Store (when Bruce Wayne is also present there) and later sells them to make money. Will Batman be able to catch the crook, considering that he can't even see him?I really liked this episode because we see how Batman faces an enemy whom he cannot see. The way in which he tries to fight Lloyd is very interesting. (5/5).This was probably the last DVD that WB decided to release separately as a separate 4 episode DVD. Since most of the people are buying the series in its entire volumes, it is rather pointless in buying these separate 4-episode DVDS. However, if you are a huge fan of the show and collect all the merchandise, then you can add this to your collection, otherwise buy the 3 Volumes of the show.",1.0,549,0.0,0.07536583741930443,0.05078073848073172,0.06967807130753534,0.08260308956251365,0.1970297714383287,0.09787769974880489,0.09218824644443845,0.02730018173778893,0.051822140445686414,0.07361998112982852,0.0,0.03598331113805832,0.08515391858224848,0.05706787359090547,0.09096741538691928,0.0,0.0,0.1055551137703944,0.033567368694025684,0.0,0.0340477742869455,0.1652944136774,0.13843250945639343,0.0,0.0,0.028633914646221902,0.03387662345330569,0.029342735959478405,0.02427340307798696,0.15095568830056394,0.14582373293142137,0.23485931777717645,0.11731659490235997,0.03638533448004105,0.02830864325799804,0.16709016654316297,0.0,0.37567791666184525,0.06643594742232509,0.038272326852119815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035946964907772966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029471160474935046,0.03399307046695158,0.04788368940878746,0.1820207111610828,0.0685499536488712,0.02440251686818488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885259099299418,0.0384804577704498,0.0,0.06588293861884525,0.19539622495079276,0.0809798641641134,0.11627859938997928,0.1185980345958458,0.0,0.030616202173522965,0.0,0.0,0.16318557169362874,0.4312413156675178,0.0,0.07264891982925577,0.03726919598993244,0.11628404632376593,0.05740199937220097,0.1283217092573861,0.0310216430621416,0.3142462062509059,0.0,0.07560571161871762,0.0,0.06050452109054034,0.044292758977988074,0.03515087006259036,0.1116120439044581,0.03619893875163582,0.0315688420157547,0.0,0.029912507314512095,0.030886096594465184,0.06821328825739933,0.0868552964800685,0.09586756392512943,0.04351706679408521,0.0,0.0716221570152816,
1336376,B003CI2G6S,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,8,15,1301356800,Hypatia Patron Saint of Atheists and the ugly truth about Christianity's origins,"AGORA (which is Greek for ""meeting place"", 2010) reminded me of another period, roughly two centuries later than the setting of this film. It was in the 7th century A.D.: the pope, Martin I, had been arrested and imprisoned by Emperor Constans II of Byzantium. In prison, Pope Martin wrote about the revolting nature of the Christians then living, saying ""even the Barbarians have more Christian spirituality than they.""*** SPOILERS ***This film is about the Roman astronomer/mathematician Hypatia of Egypt, a/k/a Hypatia of Alexandria (Rachel Weisz) and how four weak men condemned her to a torturous death for being a free-minded, intelligent, great teacher. Sound familiar? Well, this thing is not as splashy as TROY, GLADIATOR or even ALEXANDER - but on the other hand it is nearly 100% true. I wager few people saw it or would recognize it at all.By the way, I assume the title refers to the Agora of Alexandria which is what both the school and the museum might have been called. As stated, ""agora"" is Greek for ""meeting place"" or even ""conference building"".It is near the end of the 4th century A.D., Alexandria, Egypt. The Roman scientist and philosopher Hypatia was taught and trained by her father Theon (Michael Lonsdale), who was the Master of the Museum of Alexandria. Their 'faith' was reason, logic and scientific truth - and if she could be said to have been a spiritual figure, she certainly fits the Transcendentalist (Neo-Platonist) mould. In this film, Weisz plays Hypatia as a strong, brilliant professor of astronomy and mathematics.Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the Roman prefect of Alexandria, in the film portrayed as a student of Hypatia's in his youth, was one of the evil-minded men responsible for her assassination. Orestes was like most Romans - a Christian-of-convenience, but he sought Hypatia's counsel often. This comes back to haunt him.The other horrible figure, an outright proto-inquisitor, is Bishop Kyril (St. Cyril, played by Sami Samir). If I may quote a website about great women in history: ""The other key player in Hypatia's demise is the Patriarch Cyril, the Bishop of St. Mark [actually Metropolitan of Alexandria]. He was installed as bishop in October of 412 A.D. It was his mission and his quest to bring Christianity to Alexandria, to rid the city of pagans and Jews. He fought his battle for Christian purity by moving against groups that did not follow his beliefs. Cyril was a power-hungry man, who was later canonized .... ""In the film, Kyril confronts Orestes by reading a passage from St. Paul about the subservience of women. He then condemns Hypatia as a witch. This creates the scene of total evil: Orestes must either force Hypatia to convert, or have her killed as a pagan witch.Here enters a fictitious and unnecessary figure, Bishop Synesius (Rupert Evans), another former pupil of Hypatia's. Working behind the scenes as a sort of passive-aggressive Christian agitator, he corners Orestes (in real life Orestes was cornered by Kyril) and forces him to convert. This makes no sense, as Orestes was a powerful figure like many of the first Roman Christians: secretly pagan, Christian when it suited. I can only guess that Evans needed a job, so they cooked up this silly role for him. Really he's more of a third wheel, and this throws the truth in the film totally off balance.There's yet another silly and rather cock-eyed character: young Davus (the gorgeous Max Minghella), a former slave of Hypatia's. Though deeply in love with her, he somehow simply waltzes out into the street, becomes a frenzied Kyrilian Christian and betrays Hypatia. It is he at the end of the film who murders her, to spare her the torture that the real Hypatia endured.In real life, as far as we know, Hypatia was nabbed during a carriage ride, dragged back into Alexandria, flayed alive then dismembered. They dragged her through the city to great cheering. Her remains - such as they were - were cremated in a great pyre at Kinaron, outside Alexandria, to even more frantic cheers.What puzzles me about films such as this (a ""great historic epic"" type) is why so much goes into it, near perfect history, then it is ruined with stupid things like fictitious characters and silly screen text explaining the history. This film is a muddle and quite confusing for the average viewer. We know they are not in the great library of Alexandria; they mention its destruction. They are in a lyceum and library, presumably the Alexandria Museum ... but ... oh well. Best not to overthink it. The producers didn't!It gives the film what little punch it has: the director follows, more or less, Hypatia's true story. He presents her as a strong albeit flawed character, with a real life and influence. To its credit, there is no gratuitous sex here - a pleasant shock to me - as Hypatia was known for being 'married to her work'.Filmed in Ft. Ricasoli, Malta, with generally good acting and directed by Spanish director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, this film is a rare focusing, zooming in on a historical period few understand. It shows the late 4th century Egypt, its ugly and brutal Christianization (and the Jews are not painted in a very good light either, nor do they deserve to be).Were it not for the nauseating view of humankind in general, this film is otherwise educational quality. Just try not to eat anything while watching this. Finally, let me say everyone except Hypatia got the stink-eye-treatment in this film, so it cannot be called prejudiced in any direction. Not really knowing a lot about the Alexandrian Jews of the era, the film left them completely out of the picture except as cardboard backdrops.It struck me Hypatia is a representative of something even bigger: the choices to be made by those who are neither Jewish nor Christian. Perhaps not even monotheist. Hypatia represents what is there for us all, religious or not. Hypatia is the steadfast rock for those who long to escape religion. If you do not believe in God, or are a monotheist without religion and without interest, what is left for you? What choices? - HYPATIA! And never forget what the Christians did to her.This is as profound as what was done to the Jews, and no less meaningful or less worthy of our attention.This movie struck me as a call for logic, reason and peace, as an object lesson cogent in today's world especially. It is for the most part the thinker's action film, the historian's epic. Finally, it is a testament to the place women held long ago, and are just now fighting to attain once again.",0.5333333333333333,1111,0.09421420887146566,0.0,0.02664180897198042,0.0,0.028891476026287825,0.21469254442123467,0.07702641958369591,0.25392154692421787,0.04296862837281295,0.05437634849666422,0.0,0.05539905896432831,0.018878427730688475,0.033506618355077546,0.1347314246424986,0.015908502422512585,0.03727846970093956,0.0,0.0,0.10566550836328623,0.2080011868060112,0.017862959964989426,0.1517612596604828,0.014525556668887434,0.0,0.02909635269099015,0.09013566642959665,0.017773166709679503,0.01539448990967923,0.050939579632067744,0.14255638882514904,0.22951663283594123,0.0616087641368525,0.07693680724576894,0.019089346858685106,0.04455587818332124,0.23376760198572555,0.05599388152954564,0.2060561208596536,0.1655622958034801,0.06023803816643592,0.030641436873269076,0.043720194949100885,0.018097050402502906,0.019627306824446373,0.10732594346429526,0.06303131964154814,0.0377187177992206,0.011598583318030363,0.0,0.01776506246086532,0.0,0.053502779804702645,0.13817039281983606,0.2864882134908871,0.023976213879393256,0.012802633681359246,0.01770057552185935,0.12749009233529615,0.05475578755405259,0.03107731824733859,0.020188540689767272,0.0,0.03456508742703686,0.0,0.0,0.04066991179674324,0.0,0.043027154224815484,0.0,0.01678644086481714,0.035578808765239854,0.0321053732043601,0.4826627458760644,0.018092798409305492,0.019057409384132522,0.07821223793189479,0.04575579404711996,0.12046245467376919,0.143061827288457,0.0,0.20825353485346013,0.0,0.019833040897000862,0.01642314814152479,0.015871666512362513,0.17428447165768626,0.0,0.01951886247711258,0.03798311092208458,0.033124806121891864,0.05533179203448425,0.12554733618906835,0.01620420478272689,0.035787691346667504,0.07594684803257071,0.0,0.045661934632512044,0.017065460124625616,0.025050755889608905,
276358,6301965817,A3S75QQLGAOOAO,10,11,1088121600,Their finest hour: the movie,"Some years ago I was talking with a late-middle-aged Englishman who had been involved in the U.S. film industry. After we had exhausted, for the time being, a mutual interest -- beautiful leading actresses -- the subject somehow got around to the film The Battle of Britain. My acquaintance said that among the film's distinctions was that, having been released in 1969 (which probably meant it had been written and filmed a year or more earlier), it possessed an authenticity that was becoming less possible with each passing year: many members of the cast and crew were old enough to remember the World War II years, and some had actually been involved in events related to the story.When I saw the film in its DVD incarnation recently, it was that aura of authenticity, of being visualized through having ""been there,"" that leaped out at me. The year of the battle, 1940, was 29 years before the movie appeared. The key personnel could remember that time well enough to get the less obvious details right.So, in The Battle of Britain, it's not just the uniforms and aircraft insignia and such that are accurate; you also get a sense that the words the characters speak, the vocal style (more formal by far than today's U.K. English), the interior decor, and the countryside as seen from the air (much less built-up in 1969) ring true in a way that would be hard to reproduce now.(The only serious anachronism is that the women sport hairstyles that no one would have dreamed of in the '40s.)The film is a remarkable technical triumph in its thrilling depiction of air battles. I know nothing about the production background, but they obviously used real Spitfires, Messerschmitts and Heinkels in dazzling maneuvers. I would not have thought there'd have been enough left in airworthy condition, or that anyone would have allowed them to be used in simulated aerial combat that surely had the potential for accidental destruction of the aircraft. Perhaps the Spitfires' owners felt that it was worth the risk to aid a movie that might enable the younger generation to better understand the heroism and sacrifices of the RAF pilots in the war.The shots of the planes exploding and crashing were presumably done with models, but the verisimilitude is outstanding. You are almost never conscious that you are watching special effects.In the intervals between aerial dogfights, the scenes on the ground are less compelling, although it's interesting to see how the locations of the German bombers and the RAF fighters were plotted on huge horizontal maps by RAF women (WAAFs?) receiving radio messages from spotters via headphones.With all this going for the film, it's too bad I have to tell you not to get too excited when you see the cast list. Many of the famous names involved have only routine or minor roles. Even Michael Caine doesn't make much of an impression. In the movie's one concession to romance, Christopher Plummer is a colorless ""leading man."" Susannah York, playing the object of his affections, blows her one big moment, in the aftermath of a bombing attack on the airfield where she's stationed, by egregiously overacting.Two greats of the English stage and screen provide some compensation. Ralph Richardson, as a diplomat who receives a German ambassador who wants to persuade the British government that they have no chance against an invasion, has only one scene. But Richardson, with that extraordinary voice that Kenneth Tynan compared to the sound of very expensive tissue paper being crinkled, offers a riposte that stirs the blood.Laurence Olivier plays the air chief marshal in overall charge of the RAF defense strategy, with an air of controlled, bottomless melancholy, as though he feels that every RAF airman who will die in the cockpit is his brother. We, too, should mourn all those who were killed or maimed to save Britain in her darkest hour, and honor them for every hour of freedom that they helped make it possible for us to enjoy.

Produced, Written, & Directed by Andy Sidaris.Plot:Paraphrasing Leonard Maltin, the film is more concerned with including as many Playboy centerfolds as possible (when two of the Playboys centerfolds are taking a shower together (while wearing make-up), the song playing notes that the singer is in love with the girl in Playboy), than with story and plot.  The plot, beyond showing off beautiful naked women, involves private investigator Abilene's investigation into a Soviet espionage case involving Lady Chamberlain.Review:The main actor, Darby Hinton, appears to have some idea of how to act.  The rest of the actors appear to have been cast for some other attribute than the ability to act (though some of the background characters also seem to know how to act). Despite the similarity in plots and actors in other Sidaris films, this film, at least, seems to have a more unique plot line (see beginning of review), and non-recycled actors.  The use of and the type of computers used, plus the use of a DoLorean (that ""Back to the Future"" car, odd, no license plate, maybe the police know that car is his) really help date the movie to the 1980s.  The special effects are not the best in the world.  At one point, one of the bad guys ends up getting shot twice, and receives two blood stains on his shirt.  The screw-up involves the fact that the two separate blood stains appear right after the first shot, but before the second shot is fired (the gun was not the kind that can make that kind of wound pattern).  The actual investigation or the ""mystery"" aspect of the movie is actually better than might be expected.  The investigator actually does follow clues, and there does seem to be a real mystery (who killed Shane; and who is selling secrets to the Soviets), though the investigator does need to have the killer leave clues and a tape recorder noting what they did to be able to put all the clues together (and it does help explain some of the odd activity).",0.0,700,0.0,0.035298246830766766,0.04756720292694195,0.03263433199874673,0.0,0.21295525553102604,0.06876281064335475,0.06476575307828732,0.07671766836296837,0.09708540460173835,0.0,0.0659409247194709,0.03370619479149109,0.019941289977316125,0.02672823598988902,0.056807175803359325,0.0,0.0,0.06591687671232473,0.0,0.15915963416081408,0.031893143683453494,0.09677134915370228,0.0,0.03171112580003148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136865989430394,0.0,0.03414890814627022,0.0,0.05494624973340866,0.06816555412771268,0.0,0.12173487795639222,0.03332446792163221,0.11196947148003367,0.015557927509662355,0.0,0.0,0.026019847067398714,0.03231109680954081,0.03504326930688869,0.0,0.0562691440227602,0.0,0.1242510597386321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03184190166168737,0.044853486560907416,0.3100035873924481,0.042807957681114,0.045716525853105254,0.0,0.02845314998910904,0.0651752454384114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030856848526287086,0.030505174998322938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11471492106739156,0.02997108942105415,0.09528544504325498,0.13375142339923923,0.7271122637399031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446264660711162,0.026884726711740543,0.06010059096023386,0.0,0.29435989922498473,0.0,0.10623178200829028,0.08796736225780413,0.0,0.020744899715268276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028019567025850185,0.028931545075649448,0.031948288090423084,0.05423924682931726,0.0,0.06114479256042057,0.0,0.022363240989520087,

631705,B00005JNJV,A1LQQYERP96R81,8,22,1148774400,"Batman Begins, The Only Problem Is You Can't See Him Do It!!","This film would have gotten three stars from me if ONLY the fight scenes were not so HORRIBILY directed. Shot at extreme close-up, one has to struggle, unsuccessfully, to follow them. I cannot believe the crappy way those scenes were shot, it ruined the whole movie for me. The clueless director should have taken a cue from Spiderman 2 or the X-Men movies. People want to be able to see the action in fight scenes. Maybe he did not want us to get to good of a look at that terribly designed bat-suit. In fleeting shots, it looks okay, but if you get a good look at it, forget it. This film probably would have done better at the box-office (it limped to 200 million, good, but look nothing compared to the spidey movies, a fact which I am sure disappointed Warners, but that it is what they get for having a director ill-equipped to direct coherent fight sequences) if these flaws had been fixed before release.Also, it looked like he tried to rip off the far superior ""Blade Runner"" in some of the claustraphobically obvious set scenes. (hell, he even has Rutger Hauer (Nexus Six) in a barely there supporting role!) The use of real world settings like Chicago, does NOT mesh when mixed in with these scenes, which also have some laughably chessey cgi, exspecially for a film with a supposed $ 200 million budget. Most of that budget must have wound up in someones pocket, or more likely, it was only there on paper.Bale was merely okay as Batman, to me he has an overall sinester appearance unsuitable for the role. Katie Holmes was a baby doll so she could have been awful and I would not have cared, but she was servicable in a thankless damsel in distress role. Neeson was good, but too beefy for the role of Ras. Why do they always do that?  Way back in ' 89's ""Batman"" fat ass, bald nicholson was all wrong visually for Joker, yet he undeniably stole the show with a great performance. Neeson was unable to overcome this asthetic  flaw to  to make the role his own. And where was his hot daughter Talia, or his hulking henchman , Ubu ? The only cool thing was the red herring thrown at us concerning Ras's true identity.  Oldman made an okay Gordon, but being able to not only drive that crappy looking batmobile with no training, but succeeding in his mission with it? Gimme a break.Now for the one thing that made this movie cool for me , Cillian Murphy's STANDOUT performance as the ""Scarecrow""!! He was incredible and truly made the role his own, the one real casting gem in this seriously flawed film. But, he did not have enough screen time. Why do these idiotic movie executives feel the need to have two major villians in every ""Batman"" movie since the original?  Again, have they learned nothing from Spiderman's incredible success? The first Batman film had a gross none of these seguels could remotely come close to, especially if you factor in adjustments for inflation. Why in the hell are they so retarded?  If Scarecrow had been the only villian, the movie would have been much more solid. He should definately return as the main villian in a sequel.It was way too long.  That's right , you don't even see Batman until the film is half over. The boring first hour spends WAY too much time focusing on Bruce Wayne's transformation into becoming Batman. Again, the incoherent fight scenes do NOT help matters, although for some stupid reason, Bruce's fight scenes are easier to follow, which is really dopey, 'cause people laying down their hard earned cash expected to be able to see BATMAN in action, not all this training crap. I am damn glad I did not pay money to see this in the theater. Matter of fact, I pretty much never pay to see movies anymore, because of crap like this. The simple minded exec's who greenlight this stuff try way too hard to suck in every possible demographic, (this reached a pinnacle with Batman and Robin) diluting the movies into averge pap unworthy of my hard earned cash.So, I am still waiting for a truly good Batman movie. I think that one with a different director, better shot fight scenes, a better looking batsuit, more like the one from the actual comics, complete with visible bat symbol with the yellow , a utility belt that looks like it could actually hold stuff, and a better looking cowl, along with the return of Scarecrow as the major villian. Or Joker, if he is done right. Which I doubt will ever happen.Why does hollywood hate comic book fans?",0.36363636363636365,794,0.0,0.0,0.03925232484487904,0.053859521766620296,0.042566839339798206,0.058576696779687715,0.03782858797009627,0.07125936141495674,0.10551201439326571,0.04005730424150612,0.028453262997331016,0.10882853892568736,0.0,0.13164398053301551,0.0,0.0,0.10984739091554928,0.028333992718319077,0.0,0.05189358404725324,0.1313380917492182,0.05263626865384834,0.1756819917429939,0.08560407733866965,0.0785038010125236,0.10717172854413515,0.022133347267104305,0.07855751618941259,0.06804374876249518,0.20639051032633035,0.2100333985865105,0.0,0.0,0.11335373486518466,0.0,0.1312915204849604,0.25831359258494446,0.05499851829218132,0.05279822827258327,0.14122194824159023,0.0,0.0,0.10735753067846705,0.0,0.0,0.10541808682671902,0.06964971400516178,0.027786164320606786,0.10253163228184806,0.1122396807338252,0.07852169535524034,0.022780518738549884,0.026275849551694447,0.16655838108206877,0.1279070532494364,0.035325008776019434,0.0943128780517915,0.13039443775309273,0.09391784401937094,0.0,0.0,0.05948899026580602,0.0,0.025462986417412938,0.12586393195361195,0.0,0.059920427735867685,0.03055783694892328,0.08452458247408173,0.0709968276862069,0.0,0.0,0.14190596512522852,0.4333413047980487,0.02665676348261041,0.028077959144386506,0.0,0.04494242597820185,0.08874080974454976,0.12398710532568011,0.04795801113286702,0.294042868237459,0.11402358314764609,0.02922072464259471,0.04839361670258105,0.0,0.18830497519975758,0.0,0.14378917200403432,0.0,0.0,0.054348198289164915,0.02312166953774341,0.02387423131265165,0.10545455735870307,0.022379038548428782,0.024701129298623288,0.1681883813826252,0.10057259777571939,0.05536225461395172,

13084,0767817478,A1B9ISLYYCHIVE,1,4,1123113600,A monster size slap in the face.,"Sometimes life can be so cruel. There was The Curmudgeon, itching in his cinema seat with excitement at the thought of seeing a mega-bucks US version of Godzilla. I really had high, high hopes.And then this - one giant Godzilla turd of a movie. Don't get me wrong, the Japanese movies aren't exactly Citizen Kane, but what they lack in coherent plot, effects and script they make up for in spirit, ambition and, dammit, a love for their monster.This movie looks good (if you can buy this image of Godzilla, anyway). The city being torn to pieces is excellent, but oh man, did they ever screw up the rest.No-one cares about the characters in Godzilla movies. The star of the movie, the reason people buy tickets - is for Godzilla. So the tedious sub-plot with Matthew Broderick (who really looks like he doesn't want to be here) is frustrating enough, but when they turn the movie into some lame Jurassic Park rip-off, with lots of LITTLE Godzilla's, you're left wondering who greenlighted this crap.Word to movie producers - Godzilla is SUPPOSED to be almost indestructible (how easily did he die?), he is SUPPOSED to be fearless (don't have him RUNNING AWAY from the army!!) and DON'T replace him mid-movie for lots of little dinosaurs.Not that hard is it? Well done, America - you just screwed up a perfectly good franchise. This still depresses me so much I can't even make an amusing quip.

716664,B00006II6O,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,11,12,1127520000,Not PC? Who cares?,"Pretty good stuff for classic animation fans. These cartoons are relatively plotless, but full of funny gags expounded on various situtations.In particular, I enjoyed BLUE RHYTHM which has Mickey and crew rocking out (or perhaps ""Jazzing out"" is more time-appropriate) to the ""St. Louis Blues."" It's clear that Uncle Walt was a big jazz fan. The first three MM cartoons STEAMBOAT WILLIE, PLANE CRAZY (I like where Mickey tries to kiss Minnie and she resists on the plane-that sly dog!), and GALLOPING GAUCHO are real knee slappers, as are MICKEY'S REVUE, THE KARNIVAL KID, and THE CHAIN GANG.Yeah, these toons have their moments of political incorrectness. BIG DEAL! The generation of SOUTH PARK, THE SIMPSONS, and LIQUID SWIM, (not even people familiar with TOM & JERRY or the LOONEY TUNES, in fact) et. al. will not be shocked, warped, or traumatized by anything here. Some animal cruelty (by a mouse, at that, but as in LOONEY TUNES it's too offbeat to take seriously as opposed to live-action) abound in Steamboat Willie, and gags involving outhouses, bodily functions, Minnnie's panties, cow udders, drunkenness, et cetera abound elsewhere, but who hasn't seen this kind of thing before? What child who has ever gone out to play isn't aware of such things?To the crybaby sissy critics who feel that these cartoons are oh-so traumatic for the kiddies and (gasp) so terribly disgusting-go watch Barney and the New Zoo Revue with your raggedy ann dolls!

442244,6304978286,A106YXO3EHVD3J,2,2,1385424000,"NOT DISNEY'S BEST FILM, BUT A NICE CHANGE! LACK OF EXTRAS KEEPS ME FROM GIVING THIS 5 STARS FOR THE RELEASE,","Disney Studios 25th full length animated feature film. The Black Caldron is one of Disney's different efforts, for one it is not a musical. This is another decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with great animation and dramtic use of color and wonderful backgrounds, but the films after Sleeping Beauty just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to in the early days.While this isn't Disney's best, it is an enjoyable and pretty solid film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new animation process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone.  The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style.OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the 25th anniversary DVD is far and away the best choice. The first release was released in full screen and fortunately the 25th anniversary edition is presented in 2:35:1 the correct aspect ratio. It would be nice to see this film on Blu Ray as the 25th DVD looks and sounds great. The extras are very thin with a stills gallery, lost scene and nothing more really worth mentioning. Why can't we get a making of for each of these films? Is it too much to ask to have some insight on these &#34;animated classic&#34; even if only 15-20 minutes long?If you must own Disney's The Black Caldron then the 25th anniversary edition is a no brainer, but that is until Disney decides it's time to release it on Blu Ray?.....let's hope they don't mess it up!",1.0,268,0.05341192511249571,0.06724845440881388,0.04531132796373173,0.0,0.04913747211986363,0.2975219146622392,0.04366782254787974,0.12338847348479184,0.0,0.04624056427237741,0.0,0.06281367585949367,0.12843071298116085,0.11397344488426114,0.0,0.05411309505569998,0.0,0.13083055249903108,0.1883723049878119,0.05990389652768132,0.30322297458291364,0.06076122219988124,0.07374557374299821,0.0,0.06041445083206856,0.0,0.10219943515888522,0.0,0.05236467102256101,0.12995401334069068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10103848484662285,0.19879131503439604,0.0,0.33521500080301836,0.26676166820996466,0.0,0.052113735854231326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10720115887283498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06042822184537351,0.0,0.06066359846289861,0.042726309617145464,0.1181206659542017,0.12233336988043955,0.08709683852859859,0.06020886820870795,0.0,0.0,0.05285506554075965,0.0,0.0,0.058786924497083226,0.05811693368067049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05463728252848464,0.0,0.0,0.03640236031997011,0.5130584881939406,0.0,0.0,0.06651013013862302,0.0,0.05121943668295866,0.0858754799602946,0.055360827148895245,0.1475788835522237,0.06581215242690101,0.0,0.05586367295255509,0.053987796956955415,0.03952214537470077,0.0,0.0,0.12920032553971428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766000040643765,0.058048510247344316,0.04260532822854622,

In the past few weeks I have flipped through the HBO channels to see that this film was showing only to catch bits and pieces. I finally decided to see the film uninterrupted & in one sitting.Of course I was intrigued to learn about the tragedy of this talented director(Adrienne Shelly) losing her life (she plays the character, June) in such an awful and untimely manner--not long after this film was completed--and what a loss it is.This movie is bursting with life and talent throughout. The dry asides (as in the pie creations) as our protagonist, Jenna, treads along through a very bad marriage and untimely pregnancy. I loved the supporting characters as well. (Cheryl Hines and Andy Griffith are magnificent) But all of the characters are so good.What a sweet little movie this makes-- with all the gooey stuff thrown in without any of the flavors overpowering a witty, smart and highly entertaining message: LOVE LIFE and squeeze it tight!

I wonder when the next one is coming out?"" Nicolas Cage returns to New Orleans to play super thief Will Montgomery, who unfortunately gets nabbed on his first movie heist. After eight years in prison he comes out to an estranged daughter with abandonment issues, who he loves dearly (Sami Gayle), and a bunch of people who want to know where he stashed the money.Will claims he burned the money in a nearby fire, something I imagine that the FBI never bothered to check for ashes as it was a good three feet away from the car which they seen Will emerge. The film description tells us his daughter is kidnapped, to no surprise as the title is ""Stolen"" because Liam Neeson has corned the market on ""Taken."" His former partner Vincent (Josh Lucas) wants his share.Outside of the great soundtrack, the first thing I noticed was the name ""Vincent."" It is the same name used for a vampire in FF VII. Nicolas Cage has recently been outed as a real life vampire (check Google), which he denies. Is a movie industry ploy, dropping clues, i.e. ""Paul is dead"" in order for us see Cage's films?If you have never seen an action film before or a kidnapped daughter film, this is a decent flick. The problem is that I have become burnt out on the same formula.As far as kidnapped daughter films, Nicolas Cage isn't as good as Liam, but is better than John Cusack.Parental Guide: Some F-bombs.

406098,6304178360,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,1,1,1309132800,The Dead Walk Among Us,"Rating:+5 The name Michele Soavi may not ring a bell for most horror buffs but stating that the dude has quite the reputation may be an understatement. Although Italian horror seemed to have it's day in the sun long before Cemetary Man ever found it's way into our dark hearts, it would seem that Soavi was destined to become a legend in our living room. Having worked under such infamous horror auteurs such as Joe D'Amato & the beloved Dario Argento, it was only a matter of time before Soavi really made a splash on the international horror scene. Soavi also served as Assistant Director on the set of Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Cemetery Man was his ultimate calling card.Fortunately, Dellamorte Dellamore Cemetery Man was anything but your run-of-the-mill zombie flick or rank Italian horror flick.  The film was based on Tiziano Sclavi's comic  book Dylan Dog, and starred Rupert Everett in the lead role. Soavi's stylish horror film managed to not only breathe life into a dying genre but also attract a whole new audience who had yet to experience the grand pleasure of a true comedy horror. I must also confide that Cemetery Man also beat Shaun Of The Dead to the punchline by about 10-11 years which is quite impressive.I first saw this masterpiece during the summer of 1996 when very little at your local box office would be even remotely interesting. Perhaps the only film that could even cause to bat an eye around that time was teenster flick ""The Craft"" which is not bad film by any means but definitely pales in comparison to ""Cemetery Man"". In a time when films by Italy's finest directors were nowhere to be found & the mom/pop theatres were nearly phased out largely due to the rising multiplexes which cater to the mainstream crowds, I was a bit dumbfounded to have something so deliciously wicked & entertaining as Soavi's film.Francesco Dellamorte has the uneasy task of being Buffalora's cemetery watchman where the recently deceased rise from their graves usually within seven days. Dellamorte ( whose name translates as ""St. Francis of the Dead"") slaughters the living dead when they rise from their graves with the assistance of Igor-like assistant Gnaghi (played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro). That is, until the day he meets a beautiful young widow (Italian supermodel Anna Falchi) at a funeral & falls head over heels.  And yes, now you have perhaps one of the most romantic if not tad erotic horror-comedies ever made.Everett may very well be the most romantic lead actor right up there with a Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman if you will.Unfortunately, Dellamorte's young love interest is about to meet an early demise after the two proceed to make love on the recently deceased husband's grave. In an almost hilarious montage, the jealous zombie husband rises from his earthly grave & attacks the beautiful widow. It would seem at this point that our hero has missed his chance at a new life & possibly love but this is only the beginning. Over the next hour, Francesco is destined to meet two other women who bare an uncanny resemblance to the widow & the end results are often hilarious if not darkly comical.While it may be difficult for some to subscribe to this kind of film, I highly recommend you check this one out if you're into strange cult films or even zombie flicks with a twist. Unlike Soavi's teachers or mentors, Michele is more interested in creating dream-like sequences which linger on in your head for days while intentionally making you giggle during your ""squirm"" moments. Perhaps he is one of the few directors in his native country or any other who has successfully proved that horror does not have to be confined to just great FX & can have broader themes which may very well appeal to a wider audience. Make no mistake, it's a winner all the way around & deserves every bit of recognition it's received.",1.0,668,0.0581473867619309,0.03660532623955693,0.024664298340254055,0.13537107099414392,0.13373490984641845,0.029445453350757194,0.023769689646974467,0.08955200266074317,0.10607798898071939,0.15102065517238675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339853828392065,0.11087188583711327,0.02945536095601978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09782239731872727,0.16505324926072462,0.033074133537994745,0.06021285119450894,0.08068431020202044,0.0,0.0,0.02781509031231445,0.032907876986854705,0.11401456780286633,0.11789636644923496,0.058655564984605287,0.0,0.0,0.1139617730463868,0.0,0.10999648194372214,0.1623120041433444,0.10367537735339406,0.13270360510854914,0.12907224879082121,0.0,0.0283670505036352,0.05396670237884552,0.10052268988386946,0.0,0.0,0.02917638351911611,0.10475704293844056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033020994045460834,0.13954317757610282,0.2250380239686522,0.11098279640339619,0.07111408470576318,0.13109388357959825,0.1475337915347335,0.06758865768757556,0.05754115643374816,0.0,0.0,0.03199946480188388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026555618392857326,0.029740691728610096,0.0,0.0,0.15851906630321147,0.5306185794199906,0.06699938104751195,0.0,0.0,0.02823968788706712,0.02788025696751624,0.07790761357912379,0.09040361551022183,0.32132623573223407,0.0,0.07344366716127337,0.030408252373160517,0.0881614724652451,0.1505915231052437,0.0,0.07228023410935953,0.0,0.06133217917091635,0.0682996577734747,0.0,0.0900086044941051,0.16565659959717105,0.08437155539313296,0.031042035077925717,0.06340895881472901,0.09479257214181291,0.11595671254155492,

Even though I had to get up to use the bathroom a few times after way too much pop and coffee, I still enjoyed it.  I enjoyed seeing that 2.35:1 aspect ratio in the middle of our 19 inch TV and enjoyed listening to it through our Dolby Pro-Logic Surround system.  Now when you're poor like me, you can still enjoy widescreen and SOME surround sound with what you got.  Turn out all the lights and the black bars will blend into the darkness and you won't even notice them.  I thank Disney for releasing this in widescreen only.  Fullscreen belongs on VHS and if Joe 6 Packs want their Fullscreen, they should buy the VHS version.  DVD is meant for a much better movie experience and only getting half the picture is not part of it.

Only instead of zombies...THEY WERE VAMPIRES!!!! CAN YOU EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD BE LIKE?Um.Well, apparently it's a very flat zombie apocalypse movie only with vampires, and you have to keep reminding yourself, &#34;Oh, right, these are not zombies. Yawn. They're vampires.&#34;Along the way, we get a very pretty narrative about growing up and what it is that's worth salvaging of our humanity. Apparently, it's good old country living. Fiddle playin'. Coffee and a slice of pie. That sort of thing. It's actually a very thoughtful movie, and had a lot to say on the subject of religion especially, but I was too bored to get the message. The real problem is that the movie is dead serious, with emphasis on &#34;dead&#34;. The emotional range is limited, humor is in dire short supply. And I'm afraid it comes with the territory. The almost universal takeaway lesson from apocalypse movies of all stripes is that the first casualty is the personality. These are not engaging people. For a refreshing exception to this rule, check out The Battery! It's a far better movie about a lot of the same stuff.",0.0,204,0.14060133219282805,0.0,0.0596386767721687,0.0,0.0,0.1779989694587934,0.11495099664092638,0.0,0.0,0.060861735692459916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05000387133142288,0.0,0.0712235445350815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07884538553510086,0.0,0.07997379582344506,0.048531886323847494,0.06503199388770348,0.15903475212316764,0.06513326385651926,0.0,0.15914356952731387,0.0,0.05701506845466299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649332308402658,0.04360812007076998,0.0,0.28076955158387296,0.2340741064179034,0.0,0.0,0.06524618448964649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2596385861960715,0.08526661881492742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11247256187080343,0.27207281123035093,0.10734328673232184,0.0,0.15849357727018645,0.0,0.0,0.13913545734436464,0.09038559310781706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23956355931616347,0.4051719168386426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13482983466000178,0.07535275352639163,0.0,0.19424302332550156,0.08662181981093714,0.0,0.0735276515662992,0.21317588230482964,0.05201896654256259,0.0,0.08738739411105367,0.08502660151441079,0.07415110616257128,0.08257484476973853,0.2107817737844304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15332389946968294,0.07640332992487678,0.16823113644086354,

The adaptation is very good, and the acting is first rate, especially that of Vicki Zhao(Mulan).  The battle scenes are some of the best-staged in recent Chinese movies.  In the equestrian scenes in particular, the horses run straight, their heads are not yanked around like a marlin trying to shake off its hook and the riders sit properly instead of bouncing around with their arms flapping like the wings of a bird trying to take off.  The entire cast is to be congratulated and I highly recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in Chinese legends.

1282660,B002P9K9TQ,A1MGEZLLG1Y5OU,20,23,1259452800,The Art of Belcato ~ Edita,"Alright, I can't pass by this DVD once again without leaving something to counter the dismal rating of the first reviewer ~ While I've only given it here three stars, basically for the ""Lucrezia"" program, I'd give four stars to the second disc ""The Art of Belcanto"", a lovely intimate look at Edita's dedication to her art, which has been her life as well.  Very touching and moving ... to see her in preparation for this role, rehearsing in excellent voice, is a treat.  To view her childhood hometown, church and the pear tree where it all began, priceless.  You soon learn she is not the diva, just basically a woman doing her job; abet with a dedication and a sense of duty, fulfilling her purpose in this world. No nonsense, no fuss, just a reverence for her art and the gift she was bestowed.  I met Ms. Gruberova many, many years ago as a young man in the side streets of the Vienna Opera house - she never was a personality, she was a person, delightful, charming and this disc shows little has changed.  Brava, Edita on a life well lived and a purpose well served.  As to the ""Lucrezia"" performance, it is in fact a senseless production of what really is a motionless opera.  Nothing really takes place of substance to stage, so some showy Venice opulence would have been welcomed, here all we get is a bare stage flanked by ""Lucrezia Borgia"" in type font illuminated in lighting across the back wall, a few chairs thrown in here and there and a lot of adult men dressed as schoolboys and acting nearly as infantile.  Whatever the intended concept, I doubt that it played any better on stage than it does in video ~ do not buy this DVD for the production, buy it rather for the beautiful music which abounds in this Donizetti piece and for the rather good on the whole collective singing; most notably from Alice Coote and Edita Gruberova.  The voice is not what it was forty or for that matter twenty years ago, BUT, compare this woman's 60 year old voice with the so called coloratura sopranos of today, not in comparison with her past,  and I tell you that 8 or 9 out of 10 Edita can still hold her own and rest miles ahead of any contenders ~ it is a miracle of nature that she still possess an instrument capable of the high demands of Belcanto singing.  I remain in awe.  Few if any names of today come to mind which can yet hold a candle to her abilities, even at an advanced age.  The score is given the attention to detail that is deserves and Edita sings it as it should be sung, trills, high notes and sospiri in the voice as required.  Sadly, it is only her final note in the opera after a long night on stage that goes awry, turning sour and unsecured ~ a shame for she'd been hitting it all night long.  Her performance merits the purchase and perhaps you'll find as I, the second documentary disc is even more rewarding than the title disc.  Brava, Edita!!

125651,079213690X,A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ,21,26,964569600,Classic movie - Epic story,"Hard to pick my top 5 all-time favorite movies... but I know one thing for sure, ""Braveheart"" is one of them. I know many of the dignified literary historians here on Amazon have trashed this movie due to fact after fact NOT being correct (way too many Hollywood liberties were exercised) - like their accents were far from authentic; Wallace painted his face blue only once and it wasn't the right battle where he painted it; parts filmed in Ireland (not 100% in Scotland) due to cost; Wallace was caputured in Glasgow - not at Edinburgh Castle as the movie depicts; armor and weapons were wrong for the time; warriors seen wearing sunglasses and wrist watches, rubber weapons used (really - it wasn't real?); Mel Gibson is a bad director and is a hypocritical & pompous jackass; etc. People please - this is a fictional war story with some romance thrown in, INSPIRED by true events. In my opinion it's not meant to taken too seriously. It's 100% entertainment. Cast, story, action, scenery - ALL STUNNING. It's a grand epic of one Scottie's life and the battle he faces within. He puts his life on the line for the cause... to free Scotland.

418595,630439408X,A2198FZZMTJ38H,19,25,1019347200,The film is incredibly tough to swallow.,"I think the thing that surprises me the most about Tom Holland's ""Thinner"" is that it was released theatrically. Based on the novel by the infamous horror writer Stephen King, this adaptation of one of his better-known books feels more like a direct-to-video release than a big-screen feature, with its low production values and overall cheap appearance. Having said that, the movie itself is entertaining to a point, after which, like many of King's novels (or movies based on them), it just flatlines.The story centers around attorney Billy Halleck (Robert John Burke), whose string of successes have made him a name in his small town. He has a wife, Heidi (Lucinda Jenney), and a young daughter, both of whom have issues about his serious weight problems. ""I can't stop thinking about food,"" he tells his wife in the car on the way home from a celebration dinner, to which she responds with A) the statement ""There's more to life than just food,"" and B), a timely session of... well, you'll see.Of course, during the ""act,"" Billy fails to notice the old Gypsy woman crossing the street, and strikes her with his vehicle. Given his status among the townspeople (coupled with the fact that almost everyone we meet in the film is prejudiced against gypsies), Billy receives little more than a slap on the wrist, after which he is greeted by the dead woman's father (her father?), who brushes his cheek and chants the word ""thinner.""Now I'm sure I don't have to tell you exactly what happens to Billy, who, despite his efforts to maintain a stable weight (""I'm digesting 12,000 calories a day!"" he later tell his wife), loses 40 pounds in no more than two weeks. And the fat grams just keep flying, to the point where Heidi insists he check himself into a nearby male clinic, disbelieving of his theory that he has been cursed by the old gypsy man, whom he later sets out to find with the help of a vigilante he helped set free in a case.If this all sounds rather hokey to you, that's because it is. The problem is, if my synopsis gives you this notion, then you're much better off leaving your experience with ""Thinner"" at this exposition, and avoiding the movie at all costs. Even for a Stephen King adaptation, the film is incredibly tough to swallow; the beginning and mid-section fares somewhat nicely, setting us up for a third act that showcases some nifty yet under-imagined make-up tricks (like we really couldn't guess that he was wearing a fat suit from the beginning), but fails in regards to giving us a sturdy conclusion that's worth waiting for.Aside from the low-budget look of the film, there's not a great deal of commendable acting to be dealt with, either. Burke has some effective moments of biting humor, but he fails to register much in his confrontations with his wife, nor do we ever care much for him as a person wasting away as a result of his wrongdoing. The wife and child are basically stand-ins for those pesky times when the film needs some refreshment from slingshot-wielding gypsies and subplots involving two men who share a similar fate to Billy as a result of letting him go without punishment.There is an intriguing premise underneath the mess that is ""Thinner,"" but the story and its execution follow a pattern very much akin to its main character's descent from obesity.",0.76,576,0.08751226462523663,0.07345506364564607,0.0494932784508491,0.0,0.02683627581987727,0.1624906577378893,0.023849043912754067,0.0673882266339239,0.0532160632921817,0.02525413871216716,0.035876735299816734,0.034305491469193976,0.0,0.06224623838187183,0.08343152077153025,0.02955369663379484,0.03462665923080884,0.03572634733799851,0.0,0.032716324640810715,0.11040284911931403,0.0,0.1006897827708038,0.13492278651628534,0.0,0.0,0.027907950004725617,0.0,0.08579640104504925,0.07097397557211708,0.29425692253901775,0.0710633089892502,0.11445242782293184,0.3716122487463671,0.0,0.055181850648567426,0.1266641265648873,0.03467383130778016,0.14978996031063363,0.04856368196821455,0.11190598954597446,0.08538525868670148,0.0812203024508214,0.0,0.03646222983297537,0.033230431227255566,0.1170951513624534,0.03503559020352538,0.04309406425054612,0.035380769124802224,0.13201073305450922,0.028723968876685005,0.0331312334628326,0.023334839587478003,0.22578930542961134,0.08908264682611851,0.023783832185049654,0.0,0.029605265572954773,0.0,0.028866627771763628,0.0,0.0,0.03210629388010943,0.03174038050340626,0.0,0.037776850499241045,0.0,0.0,0.08951993991914645,0.062369337817479914,0.13219161589361322,0.19881034572927572,0.46233871089400846,0.0,0.03540351446077432,0.03632429834530472,0.0850018952502636,0.0,0.06253416430695038,0.0,0.2740391261769136,0.0,0.07368885623905698,0.06101953849026561,0.02948526547133266,0.04316979073247858,0.0,0.03626076955358305,0.10584352702588708,0.03076846723781828,0.0,0.029154126111063893,0.030103031675872957,0.09972578296746896,0.0846532268381683,0.0,0.16965505966567218,0.0,0.11634382991341015,

81256,0788814664,A38NMDZZCN1WFP,6,7,955324800,a great film from a line of great films about boy geniuses,"There have been several great films that focused on the life of one boy genius.  Rushmore, Little Man Tate, and Searching for Bobby Fischer are prime examples.  These three movies did three very important things. First,  each one looked at the child genius with sensitivity, doing an excellent  job of focusing on the tenuous aspects of childhood, while attempting to  fathom and apprehend the child's genius.  Two, the films show that these  geniuses are, foremost, human beings who have the same basic, fundamental  needs all humans have--the need for love, contact, undertanding,  friendship, and intimacy.  And three, they show that ultimately, what makes  a human being special is not how smart, talented, or exceptional he is, but  how he conducts his life in relation to his fellow human beings and how  compassionate and caring he is.  Needless to say, these films are exemplars  of their genre.  And Goodwill Hunting is their peer.Will Hunting is a  genius, not on the order of an MIT student, but on the order of Einstein,  Mozart, Shakespeare.  On the surface, Will comes off as tough, rough, cool.  He is good looking, fast-talking, and seemingly brimming with confidence.  When forced into therapy by court order, Will aviscerates his therapists  with a mixture of brashness, brilliance, and utter lack of respect.  While  being a genius, he is also a miscreant who commits petty thefts and  assaults in his spare time.  He is a strange mix of savant and savage.  Underneath the outward manifestation of his genius, underneath his  rebellious nature and irreverence is a scared kid in need of compassion and  human connection. And that is what Goodwill Hunting is essentially  about--one boy's attempt to make human contact after bearing years of  mental, emotional, and physical abuse.The genius aspect of Will is  almost ancillary, but is important because it allows another important  message to be sent--great intelligence does not designate a person as  great.  This message is sent home in many ways throughout the movie, but is  most aptly illustrated when Will embarrasses a pompous Harvard boy in a  debate. This scene was definitely one of the most gratifying scenes on  film.In sum, Goodwill Hunting is a very good film.  It is funny,  humane, uplifting, and touching.  The acting is very strong, the writing is  very good, and the character of Will is complex, smart, snide, vulnerable,  and highly likable.  If you like films that make you feel excited about  being human, then watch this film.  If you want something a bit more  commercial, watch Titanic.",0.8571428571428571,419,0.0757847491821564,0.047708514901172665,0.03214551448585099,0.04410801255701355,0.06971984237987837,0.3453920767394994,0.09293865477096679,0.05835753280014522,0.03456343541957145,0.032804748733945815,0.046603342933954094,0.044562320682084204,0.0,0.10780924441858183,0.036125432832947876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10755873817800946,0.04310623493462125,0.052317809156253774,0.0,0.0,0.10532136476513365,0.10875602981583311,0.0,0.0,0.0921941334776453,0.22934120661495963,0.0,0.0,0.22279327243116837,0.13819711941107315,0.07168039923405632,0.14102983479571496,0.04504078862713039,0.43238871034285187,0.04205566468979033,0.0,0.0,0.035167986316510774,0.0436711333285706,0.04736389158161453,0.0,0.03802621287335719,0.09102141605157237,0.027989272684690338,0.045959090285415005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093482357155282,0.3142467139962555,0.1735755401714238,0.12357937012280443,0.0,0.03845679749333948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010081126963251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291258338225488,0.30938509937071196,0.08732174515140338,0.0,0.047184720640680605,0.036805397158534224,0.03633694305245376,0.060923208590413336,0.03927499702696732,0.10469786148909462,0.0,0.047860361443438776,0.0,0.15320367661950676,0.028038456468794267,0.08900562194195034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07574154815031882,0.07820677644264674,0.0,0.07330885094637019,0.24274654186431902,0.08264227005334726,0.0,0.0906773376963089,

The heroes are Charles Bronson a detective, and his lovely wife Jill Ireland portraying the innocent woman who has to be protected. The music is a rousing western classical piece. Definitly a must see, if you like the old westerns. This is in color. The characters are believable. Great for the western fans of Louis Lamour and Zane Grey.  The author of the book is Alistair MacLean. Just seeing Charles Bronson riding his horse is pure talent and hard work. He is a gifted horseman. We miss you both.

It doesn't live up to the first 3, but it is entertaining and does allow for a return of Jason, who of course made these as popular as they are.Jeremy Renner is not Jason Bourne, that role is left for Matt Damon. Jeremy plays a role for a character caught in a parallel conspiracy where at some point it ties in with Bourne.I gave this a 4 star because it's just not the Bourne we all wanted. It didn't live up the our overwhelming expectations, but it's a good movie. I recommend this to anyone who like the original Bourne movies.",0.0,128,0.0,0.0,0.16991689516823094,0.0,0.0,0.050713788216872786,0.08187688553326067,0.15423506112249996,0.18269770220744896,0.0,0.12316952244275398,0.0,0.0,0.14246631586890124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392689959445317,0.20740871244448866,0.0,0.0,0.09278577733164599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24848828872764414,0.0,0.22855489589252387,0.4446012504463543,0.0,0.09771291848978757,0.09294663874256152,0.1154198883165289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479475562505888,0.12146680572636956,0.0,0.09861314023240829,0.11374385571747735,0.3204462194510343,0.11073774327584693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024445522221343,0.0,0.0,0.06825419073256309,0.2404953387798512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603611331365366,0.16101597085848418,0.0,0.1106837817936358,0.0,0.0,0.20948805270923443,0.0,0.07410376758138544,0.0,0.0,0.2422497767887635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19375039628998006,0.0,0.14561199970113023,0.0,0.0,
1122626,B000ZIZX54,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,3,4,1263772800,A Pup Named Scooby Doo: Complete 1st Season...,"I'm a big Scooby-Doo fan and, out of all the series based on the character, this has to be my least favorite. It's not that I didn't like it as it was entertaining, it's just the 'babyfication' of the show kinda made it less appealing to me. Most of the time, I'd figure out the mystery long before it ever got started. I imagine it was the producers' intentions to gear this more towards the younger set to  get them into Scooby Doo and, in that respect, they achieved what they set out to do. I just didn't care too much for it.However, do I recommend this DVD set to everyone? Quite simply, yes. For what it is, it is a good show.  I agree, there are some areas of the DVD transfer that left the animation sketchy. It should be clearer than it is. But, overall, it's definitely worth recommending.The best way to describe this show to you is simply this...A Pup Named Scooby-Doo is a re-imagining of the series inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and even Looney Tunes. For the most part, it works. It was a success when it aired from 1988 to 1991 on ABC Saturday Mornings. I just wish it could've been more appealing to me, you know?",0.75,219,0.0,0.0,0.047601486913520674,0.0,0.0,0.11365799610452769,0.045874914220537605,0.04320828859519692,0.0,0.09715537875416998,0.0,0.06598845153708813,0.06746097695658183,0.03991132526130898,0.053495000647749445,0.0,0.13321246988082755,0.0,0.13192877239475737,0.06293160396697574,0.0,0.0,0.11620931634139733,0.0519062422835359,0.06346796308799695,0.0519870723984248,0.0,0.0,0.05501132530051687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034806462336547085,0.06669697295878384,0.16007167614317358,0.5293507892878417,0.0,0.16424312153897608,0.05207720166236886,0.0,0.0,0.12784103108188558,0.11261939983935176,0.13478567116840284,0.0,0.0,0.06348243012613246,0.055252093673517355,0.0,0.044885814640690136,0.18613621319383436,0.08567762289835772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665795171131774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15181984585471828,0.0,0.22234583271866107,0.0,0.05739880083302233,0.0,0.06356941458511349,0.11472670673739473,0.37729291120816316,0.0,0.06810055761292072,0.0,0.054501900473860686,0.10761641534467001,0.15035977091623548,0.05815891538555524,0.3100758512196387,0.06913847934466386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12455910941435626,0.0,0.06974953373085593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11215904833858348,0.057904794882375835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08951743704094116,

I was hunting for something else, as we all do, at another to be unnamed site selling DVDs, when I saw the listing for British TV Series. Suddenly this show flashed back into my brain. Well sort of. You see I have been struggling to remember the name of this series for years. We have all experienced this phenomenon. Frustrating. Quizzing people. Combing the Interwebs. NOTHING.Well long story short, one WikiGoo search later, I finally found the name and now the DVD. Hurray!I saw this when it first came out. It was excellent. The plot. The actors. Havers and Clarke are great foils for each other. The sophisticated Havers and the working man Clarke. It has been on my mental wish list, though I could not remember the name, for years.I highly recommend this series. If you enjoy good British action/comedy/drama you will enjoy this. And do not worry the accents will not do you in.I only wish my mental processes would have been better at remembering the name. I also got stymied by the Kevin Bacon movie by the same name.Please get this one you will not be disappointed.- Brain empties a section of storage capacity with a sigh",1.0,205,0.0,0.0,0.10990477219487033,0.07540213851890261,0.0,0.13120972662773572,0.052959185981176944,0.04988076447709124,0.11817158806813072,0.11215867887574826,0.0,0.22853631904981317,0.0,0.0,0.12351202117775398,0.0,0.23067587440650703,0.0,0.07615099136680674,0.0,0.0,0.07368961123259325,0.22359172768815275,0.0,0.07326905604368264,0.12003043853246141,0.06197239269047812,0.0,0.06350649493654696,0.157604807383375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06126840769747103,0.04018147921468584,0.07699670844778243,0.03695817555726302,0.10784051028183977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047847338695807505,0.0,0.0,0.19135333249703837,0.0,0.20726937550620986,0.10744022631819053,0.04945423051568266,0.10562875364236707,0.07301973084838317,0.0,0.07529421599221489,0.06410123250251915,0.08328326983311474,0.0,0.0,0.07048268770616309,0.2628971276197217,0.0,0.08556059091815951,0.0,0.0,0.06924867456075182,0.0,0.0,0.4355566826347873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777267256351681,0.0,0.07159191445707801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09586283561443654,0.0,0.0,0.1566907546531321,0.1366489142931179,0.0,0.0,0.13369358192738687,0.0,0.0,0.2074862061737527,0.04709200235841051,0.07039970556692274,0.258353104161616,

I was scared this wasn't going to work. I liked my history. But it worked!We're now two films past that, and Daniel Craig is still making an excellent Bond. And this film manages to do the impossible: It stays true to what has come before for Daniel Craig, but it also brings things full circle, and returns to the series many of the elements that had been part of its previous history.A great Bond film, and I look forward to the next one!On more technical matters, the picture and audio did not disappoint. Bonus features were enjoyable, if not particularly memorable.",0.0,130,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12175984670488532,0.09623055799090774,0.2648478629750329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301396096799988,0.0,0.14880331614135217,0.0,0.0,0.12416561677584478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296915111634131,0.0,0.07221146514555424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007340882030717,0.23679257483164842,0.102550686759369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09893660943351533,0.06488530492181176,0.0,0.05968029393777037,0.3482830661945136,0.13375894490493498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074767698657483,0.0,0.10497108307118881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029995209197215,0.0,0.16734994447091658,0.28915858673251366,0.07985900194313506,0.08528498729448167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14150931077419998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14258036869425034,0.3516698329159798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11211871507699502,0.0,0.3468212189002228,0.0,0.13211817841624543,0.0,0.0,0.07739995442028008,0.0,0.0,0.12651260721110266,0.0,0.12286459432464947,0.10454199540336226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
331958,6302759978,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,0,0,1298592000,Kind of a fun movie.,"I remember a girl in one of my classes way back when who was forever on crutches.  Kristy McNicol's character reminds me of her, and like Kristy McNicol this girl was very attractive.  In fact, she was more beautiful than the actress.  And, even though she was on crutches (some handicap) she had lots of boyfriends.  Tons.  It just goes to show you that no matter who you are or what condition you're in, if you're a cute girl, guys will go for you.But, no matter how true that statement this film just assumes we'll buy into the poor little beautiful girl who is suddenly unattractive because she's disabled.  Well, okay (he said smiling). :)We as audience buy into that anyway, and we follow her adventures and misadventures as she tries to escape her stigma by disguising her handicap.  It works, and again we as the audience think her clever as she regains a social freedom that she's never had before.  She finds love, sex, and all that goes with it.  There's a kind of liberation at work here, and again we accept it.It's a chick flick, but a delightful one.  Not the best movie around, but solid entertainment.",0.0,199,0.0,0.0,0.04658007557774827,0.0,0.0,0.19463355423790304,0.04489055090647621,0.16912457814655044,0.05008373515934532,0.0,0.06753001999687346,0.0,0.066013429599271,0.11716477788544567,0.05234712894012758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06158124586183952,0.05195223691923525,0.0,0.03790524966761933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12429718259198985,0.0,0.0,0.05538735812279946,0.33440240848172836,0.0,0.0,0.06675096427142548,0.05193381513982514,0.10217880268168072,0.13053163851252494,0.03132738599595314,0.1523506522648064,0.0,0.10714591091534123,0.050959752448862465,0.06328113653014032,0.0,0.06254893781521864,0.05510143165872031,0.0,0.040557522810621985,0.0,0.0,0.05406651905258552,0.12472443992291556,0.04392267498136245,0.12142812393061311,0.08383919093068827,0.08953560850152883,0.0,0.05572536518295179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5688525331669579,0.07252494522036208,0.0,0.05616716313361386,0.0,0.06220537062607474,0.18710825428354813,0.10548489408656395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053332423161812095,0.0,0.05885336738203296,0.0,0.06068447656219296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05549949152988811,0.1625151679528662,0.0,0.06825287954971733,0.3320450535640144,0.057914835072901065,0.0,0.054876194916251814,0.056662299789819494,0.0,0.15934097830831812,0.05862483173328331,0.03991726628708926,0.0,0.2189915301631574,

Hofmann does a fine job-both gentle and demanding when need be. Telramund and Ortrud are also fine, though Ortruds facial expressions are ridiculous despite the critical applause she received-her singing is fine-though neither is close to Ludwig and Dieskau on EMI.For DVD versions this about as good as it gets, but compared to CD versions it is merely good.

293595,6302048990,A2R6RA8FRBS608,1,1,1366502400,"""Irene - We can't go on meeting like this.""","The Kiss amazes me! Despite its rather short length (a mere 62 minutes) there is plenty of action including romance, a murder mystery, character development and the plot never feels rushed! The sets display wonderful art deco which is something MGM liked at the time; and of course as people pointed out before me this film has historical significance as the last silent film MGM ever made as well as being the last silent film Greta Garbo ever made. I also like the idea that Garbo's kiss with the young man represents a kiss goodbye to the era of silent film. The cinematography is incredible; for example I loved how Garbo's character Irene was filmed from an angle looking up at her during the courtroom trial scenes. The choreography was well done, too! The musical score enhances the film overall but I agree with those who say that the theme from Romeo and Juliet is used one or two times too many. However, the rest of the film is just so well done that even this becomes a minor quibble.When the film starts, we meet Irene Guarry (Greta Garbo) and her lover Andr&eacute; (Conrad Nagel) who are meeting secretly at a museum in Lyons, France. Irene is trapped in a loveless marriage to her husband Charles Guarry (Anders Randolf) and while Irene wants to run off with Andr&eacute;, Andr&eacute; thinks she should end her marriage first to Charles so that she will not be a tainted woman. Andr&eacute; even wants to tell Charles to his face that his marriage to Irene is over; but Irene feels so hopeless that Charles will ever let her go she refuses to let Andr&eacute; do that. Andr&eacute; sees Irene one last time at a dinner party but realizing he has little chance for a future with Irene Andr&eacute; travels to Paris for a new life there.Meanwhile, another man loves Irene--a young man who is her messenger and dog handler, Pierre (Lew Ayers). Pierre has an intense case of puppy love but he believes it's true love; Irene thinks it's cute but she doesn't love Pierre. Yet when she gives Pierre a playful kiss goodbye before he goes off to school, Charles spies them kissing and thinks it's a meaningful kiss--and that's what starts a huge physical fight that ends with Charles dead on the floor from a gunshot wound.There's more to the plot than what I've mentioned so far; and of course the fight sets up the murder mystery I mentioned above. Who killed Charles--Pierre or Irene--or was it suicide? Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out including what happens between Pierre and Irene. Look for some great moments in the court trail where Andr&eacute; defends Irene because he still loves her.Look also for solid performances by Holmes Herbert as Lassalle, Pierre's wealthy father who tries to help Charles financially shortly before Charles dies; George Davis as Durant and Symona Boniface has a brief cameo as a gossipy old lady in the museum.The Kiss is an excellent film for fans of the silent film era especially with its importance as the last silent film MGM ever made. People who admire the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections and anyone who loves classic film with themes of romance and drama will not be disappointed.",1.0,566,0.0,0.0,0.025567289014480656,0.07016358723366395,0.08317866685358158,0.19840267241218854,0.024639927582973155,0.1856612259766541,0.10996163624563951,0.052183236469733996,0.03706648211705596,0.0,0.0,0.10718408752237835,0.028732760908826857,0.0,0.07154990187519783,0.0,0.0,0.06760253139535817,0.37070811752109034,0.034285018750739325,0.12483463730759181,0.08363826326663781,0.0,0.0,0.02883343540400506,0.0,0.11818878310109501,0.0,0.12160603651322908,0.2569697040256648,0.0,0.05906702773142036,0.07327773406782902,0.0,0.09347469373665372,0.0,0.15475730550089892,0.08362359033740419,0.07707801589030504,0.02940560354523102,0.027971245276142562,0.10420295073139421,0.03767139286106865,0.06866484224574461,0.03024456725019034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04821734235545346,0.14996375115656346,0.023009202955105564,0.04914510659874374,0.0,0.0917611124111585,0.0,0.05964780982104875,0.07749717823421708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.195148045351268,0.0,0.11011141059712756,0.03082953548591061,0.0,0.034143840887400745,0.2054033083856868,0.4487210730659709,0.03472615590765294,0.036577568295293766,0.0,0.08782073407403528,0.0,0.06460792665826692,0.06247560296310242,0.2498177920034197,0.07427009524463536,0.03806626563405932,0.06304307271380938,0.0,0.06690208554973949,0.0,0.0,0.03645117250241378,0.12715525324241408,0.0,0.09036281186986912,0.062202621055579374,0.034344298796811785,0.20407450722296286,0.09653556790703313,0.1533710260921677,0.032754348747885687,0.0,

It's film about a young woman (the lovely Marlyne Afflack) who meets a man and learns that he has an issue.  It depict's scenes where Harpers character cannot perform for a real woman but can get it up for his films.  You really get to see how much his life is affected by it when he sees an attractive woman pass by and automatically goes to 'rewind' her passing by again. The beginning is somewhat immature but it gets better as the film progresses.  Good laughs and some good diaglogue into how the 2 main characters deal with eachother. The supporting characters also do a great job as well as the subject matter outside of the 2 main characters. You also get to witness some Jamaican culture as seen with some characters and the dancehall club scene.,1.0,157,0.0831247204579096,0.0,0.0,0.19352000255053903,0.15294481992061407,0.16837524193885753,0.0,0.2560385118628867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17737632046916674,0.2377457104285162,0.08421594784579318,0.09867181638865619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23595222364231674,0.0,0.11476987937588402,0.0,0.2820681519973304,0.15402938979722133,0.15905248613761566,0.0,0.08149488398804121,0.0,0.16770237543463276,0.10125068274445033,0.0,0.1629142951196328,0.20210921138450855,0.0,0.0,0.09880623751448758,0.09485336050928893,0.27677326180293055,0.0,0.08110435480047624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404414909377738,0.0,0.0,0.13298949759413978,0.04595765513536995,0.0634622770886707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09148980597699989,0.09044710251318772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2550952148154784,0.0,0.0,0.05665281712337491,0.3193881764782267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13780578118011724,0.0,0.0,0.08694036375121865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767754722203015,0.0,0.0,0.08578132803585088,0.0,0.08040902434552583,0.0,0.12086188264043717,0.0,0.1989193981431785,

1086369,B000SINT4S,A3S0NY1ZMVKMQ0,0,1,1338163200,Season 3 of The Office? STELLAR Television!,"Yes, I do think the show has run out of steam. Last season wasn't so hot and I'm not sure if that was due to a diminishing story line to work with or the departure of Steve Carell. Either way, the more recent programs from The Office shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the past seasons.I consider season 3 to be the tip top! It was really hitting its peak and opened up new avenues and characters for the writers to explore. This season set up seasons 4 & 5 and that three season span was executed in remarkable fashion. Overall, the extras, the quality of the DVD's and the program itself leaves me no other decision than to give it 5 stars! You will watch these episodes over and over again.

The ending is a nice twist as well. The directing is a bit off at times and the actors seem a little lost sometimes. Not sure if thats a breakdown in the script or just a lack of directors vision. (Sorry, an inside joke. I couldn't resist.)

878710,B00079HZOS,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,1,4,1112486400,A challenging intellectual sci-fi drama -with flaws,"Why, oh why, aren't movie viewers willing to expend the time and energy on flims like this one?  Final Cut is a movie which actually challenges movie goers to think and not just escape into the latest implausable fantasy - like the young, poor woman marrying a prince or a superhero winning yet another battle against crime. Those movies have their place but so do simpler, richly told movies like Final Cut, which is so much more than just an escapist fantasy.Final Cut focuses on ""cutters"", people whose job is to edit implanted chips placed in humans, chips which record their memories from birth to death. Cutters edit the chips for the funeral ceremony and they have to follow a code of ethics. Robin Williams is one such cutter and he has secrets of his own, ones that only unfold as the movie goes on. He is haunted by one particular memory and his need to find answers to ""what really happened"" is at the heart of this movie.The tone of the film is dark and somber, which may explain why it faded quickly from public view.  But it is still worth seeing, for so many reasons, including the ethical questions it raises:1. How would one change one's behavior if one KNEW that every single act was being recorded?2. Would an implanted chip in one's brain cause one to commit fewer crimes (knowing they'd be recorded?) or entice one to take risks, knowing one wouldn't be ""found out"" until after death (assuming the law doesn't catch up until then?)3. What is the role of the cutter, the person who edits the films of one's life? Should he or she leave only the best parts, omitting the little (or big) sins?And so forth. This film explores all these questions. Where it disappoints is in the final minutes, which doesn't result in a satisfying (or fully understandable) resolution. The viewer is left wondering exactly what will happen next.Part of the problem is the fact that this seems to be TWO movies- one is a philosophical examination of what implants would MEAN and how they'd affect human interpretations of the world and one another...and the other movie is a personal mystery/drama.As such, it is never boring, but there are too many loose ends and dropped connections to make for a satisfying whole. That is my main quibble with this film. But I'd watch it again in a heartbeat, if only to see Robin Williams remarkable performance. It is among his best.",0.25,418,0.0,0.04588917909779981,0.03091966443490942,0.0,0.06706111771175614,0.20302379508169602,0.0297981648400228,0.05613210304112331,0.033245379393793836,0.09466127753266278,0.0,0.0,0.08763889135388328,0.10369800308751957,0.03474781096604487,0.0,0.04326424587055014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10345704975324466,0.0,0.07548405099223164,0.06743165802361421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03573274342252728,0.05911891006858312,0.11029770814141093,0.0,0.0,0.10714859183478263,0.08861803637626797,0.06894690989789229,0.11304312169570752,0.04332318497647739,0.35351485072231387,0.14158163936953289,0.0,0.07112301923051537,0.10148062830693994,0.0,0.09111539556659133,0.0,0.03657610589160589,0.0,0.16153151063773824,0.13261940324372923,0.04123517066974378,0.03588913511914043,0.0,0.029155692743360058,0.1813578616229128,0.08347817015918084,0.3863169194292534,0.12325646265602955,0.18495135211768007,0.042365255773261765,0.03606738013755708,0.04686039932308074,0.0,0.04011517782187001,0.03965798770741266,0.0,0.0472002493027105,0.0,0.1331626463873206,0.0,0.0,0.041291671641817025,0.09936135763957779,0.40261754739579936,0.0839917824037463,0.0,0.04538535941949059,0.03540184525702172,0.10485376610787882,0.09766656385515841,0.03777726840522044,0.24169265014342037,0.04490907153300965,0.04603523506260747,0.03812040166152469,0.0,0.026969226629411137,0.04280572277785183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14570637863762873,0.0,0.20767047172037734,0.035256630786983524,0.038914924509312596,0.026496918767244873,0.11883389022923277,0.0,

413381,6304291698,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,12,12,1029196800,"Before ""Wild, Wild West""","Probably the greatest movie (IMNSHO) ever to come out of the house that Mouse built.  Though based on the classic Verne novel, ""20K"" takes a different direction from the book.  As in the original book, set shortly after the Civil War, the famed marine biologist Professor Aronax and his faithful aide, Conseil (Peter Lorre) embark on a global study of the oceans, hot on the trail of a mysterious monster that has been poking triangle-shaped holes in the sides of ships.  Aboard the USS Lincoln, they meet Ned Land, a strong-willed whale hunter eager harpoon the mysterious beast.  When the Lincoln is instead herself attacked, Land, Conseil and the Prof find themselves adrift at sea, eventually coming upon the iron-plated sin of the monster, which ofcourse is really a submarine ship (unheard of in those days) under the command of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.  A genius served by a loyal crew of outcasts, and owing no loyalty to any country, Nemo stalks their ships.  In both film and book, Nemo (whose name means ""no man"" in latin) is tortured by some terrible secret.  Professor Aronax, in thrall to Nemo's genius and the secrets his fantastic submarine have revealed, loyally follows the captain, though not so closely that he can't see the depth of Nemo's pain.  Ned Land, probably because of his casting, is a much more significant character here, playing the brawn counterpoint to James Mason's cool Nemo.The flick steers a different course from there.  While Verne was fastidious to bring the fantastic Nautilus into the realm of possibility - carefully documenting its dimensions, its compartments and the science behind its propulsion (harvesting electricity from the sea using elements commonly found in sea water), the film hints at a more seductive possibility (with the professor witnessing an incredible fire burning inside of a propulsion unit deep within the Nautilus, and also climaxing with the Captain's mysterious island being wiped out by a familiar looking mushroom cloud).  James Mason's Nemo isn't as specific with his facts as Verne's, and his character hints instead at the many scars he's endured.  The other altered character is the Nautilus itself.  Verne probably conceived the Nautilus as some hopped up hybrid of two legendary confederate warships - the Hunley and the Virginia - essentially a 19th century approximation of the WWII submarine.  Disney's ship is wonder in its own right - a beautiful if terrifying monster that matches its creator in genius and pain, and wonderfully matching the Victorian age in which it was built.  ""20K"" single-handedly spurred a run of movie makers onto works of Verne and HG Wells - offering tantalizing if improbable prospects that industrious men of the 19th century invented airplanes, submarines, nuclear power and interplanetary travel.  Only this film realized the promise of that genre with its combination of wit, great performances and even a deeper, if more obscure vision of science.  And, though it often sounds like a throwaway line in other, lesser films, this really is a great film for the whole family.",1.0,505,0.0,0.04185566672674362,0.0,0.038696871562438916,0.030583329757153655,0.252516342977296,0.0,0.10239654069876945,0.09096964997860475,0.0,0.040886076505135135,0.03909544547557789,0.0,0.0,0.09508076787638985,0.033680174393824036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037284388923700576,0.1258180070665522,0.0,0.02294974794807236,0.09225694577319643,0.0,0.0,0.06360927600904236,0.0,0.032591949329449886,0.02696127328629401,0.06706859443343696,0.0,0.0,0.16288428769225796,0.0,0.0943300448796881,0.22683538265518552,0.03951521529840234,0.13277024505797844,0.03689630433632041,0.2550620513111702,0.0,0.030853601663429146,0.0,0.04155332156174385,0.0,0.1000835487881635,0.0,0.04911113547932099,0.0,0.03761073078459013,0.0,0.07551445998364217,0.026593000411984397,0.3675935210097626,0.0761407054524667,0.0,0.03747420433513809,0.0,0.07728297002915505,0.06579434509068137,0.0,0.0,0.0731783634663777,0.0361721771705074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030364518701458593,0.0680128609191487,0.0,0.0,0.1359417171752702,0.6705916305751073,0.03830458641005554,0.0,0.0,0.03229013605651304,0.0318791515816977,0.035632793851949576,0.0,0.09185359901828755,0.0,0.04198888483843426,0.0347697400303001,0.0,0.04919743538113427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0343062111379609,0.07576676004413863,0.0,0.0,0.09667169672778686,0.0,0.0,

The special effects suffer if you look too closely, but they are typically shot in such a way that it's not too noticeable. The movie itself is actually quite good. I was surprised to discover that I actually cared about the characters even though we really don't learn a ton about them besides what we see them do.The plot is not ""dudes mow down tons of zombies with big guns"". It's dark and brutal and real. There is one part near the end that is incongruous - more of an action horror film type of event - but not over much is made of it.Stake Land is a step up from many big budget zombie movies. Its director really makes the most of his resources and shows some real skill. The ending is rather open ended, so be warned if you hate those.  That aside, I would definitely recommend it.",0.5714285714285714,158,0.17391160430049177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07999689759953002,0.13210153499808178,0.07109218643229785,0.0,0.0,0.07528066718650987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237008689584338,0.0,0.0,0.10321943816992353,0.10649752479761847,0.0,0.0975248760182062,0.08227562455920642,0.0,0.0,0.08043891342622136,0.0,0.0805641755590158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08521137355910098,0.0,0.16449290077784703,0.0539394471144487,0.0,0.3968999837495078,0.1930195242461015,0.11119441518350408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869113455893815,0.0,0.08726293558591926,0.1044384303046463,0.1284601286757184,0.10546738242170745,0.09837848929822895,0.0,0.0,0.2782375297541526,0.24037883948517996,0.0,0.0708977952306843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19141284141409431,0.09461566075499972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07942455293480336,0.08895071127968937,0.0,0.0,0.23705540926438076,0.2923447208451347,0.0,0.21107036907738827,0.0,0.08446139541047057,0.08338638221838643,0.0,0.0,0.048052341018201196,0.21428729608461886,0.0,0.09094730216926727,0.0,0.06434293178007405,0.0,0.10809059678502757,0.21034100384354792,0.0,0.0,0.08690623306916169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06321610404518398,0.09450426588356942,0.1387248440937029,
290345,6302004500,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,0,0,1374278400,"HISTORIC, ENTERTAINING PRECURSOR TO TALKIES","Warner Brothers' THE JAZZ SINGER (1927) holds the honor as the film that revolutionized the cinema with sound giving birth to the ""talkies"". Yet, had it not been for a movie also released by Warner the prior year, THE JAZZ SINGER's road to phenomenal success may not have been so surely paved. That movie was DON JUAN, an extremely lavish production that put Vitaphone on the map as a major technical innovation in recording sound for motion pictures. The system combined music and sound effects on a disc which played in synchronization with a silent film. DON JUAN was the first feature length film done in this new process, becoming a hit with the critics and public alike. Soon after, Vitaphone incorporated the crucial element of dialog - enter THE JAZZ SINGER.Sublimely directed by Alan Crosland from Bess Meredyth's screenplay, DON JUAN stars the Great Profile himself, John Barrymore, in the title role of the legendary Great Lover and doubter of women. Barrymore displays an energetic vigor and nuanced emotion in his portrayal, all expressed with the wonderfully stylized pantomime customary to the silent screen. It's a remarkable performance, actually two performances, since Barrymore also plays Juan's embittered father in the film's prologue. Others in the fine cast who went on to become famous stars include a young and pretty Mary Astor as Adriana, the one woman to whom Juan loses his heart, future Charlie Chan Warner Oland as the evil Cesare Borgia, lovely Estelle Taylor as his scheming sister Lucretia, Myrna Loy as her slinky, exotic handmaid, and sweet June Marlowe, better known as Miss Crabtree of the Little Rascals shorts, in a small role as one of Juan's conquests. The arch villain, Count Donati, is played by veteran heavy Montague Love, and the climactic swordfight between him and Barrymore is still considered one of the best in screen history.No expense was spared in the production of DON JUAN, as evidenced in part by Ben Carre's sumptuous art direction. The picture's synchronized music score was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, an important factor in getting the industry sold on the Vitaphone process. In addition, the film's gala premiere included a prologue of special Vitaphone short subjects featuring musical performances by various artists of the day. DON JUAN is remembered today primarily as the film that paved the way for THE JAZZ SINGER and also for having been loosely parodied in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (MGM, 1952). But the film deserves better recognition than being just an historical relic. It's a rousingly romantic, meticulously mounted and well acted swashbuckler, one of the all-time great silents.The DVD-R of DON JUAN fom the Warner Archives is beautiful, having been transferred from a sharp 35mm print with excellent contrast. This edition also contains the feature introduction by the Board of Censors head William B. Hayes, and the original program of Vitaphone shorts preceding the feature, presented exactly as it was in 1926.Highly recommended for those with a refined taste.",0.0,497,0.0,0.03861203712012708,0.0520327996436021,0.1427921386087477,0.11285302623893259,0.1708281225788886,0.0,0.25976846587286456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426288337835885,0.03687052364688268,0.021813373126401883,0.2046623311354654,0.0,0.0,0.2253568885983452,0.036052568030668884,0.0,0.2031184160597206,0.034887263769419974,0.10585621840092854,0.05673829285833404,0.0,0.0,0.08801975641005287,0.034711893002825185,0.0,0.02487189349372161,0.0,0.0373547988169857,0.04010834354371659,0.09015688418563003,0.0,0.0,0.3043732956242122,0.0,0.0699892208703889,0.0680740068927984,0.0,0.0299221375563443,0.0,0.03534445422696106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04530523903774075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034831211159894356,0.04906432028650578,0.2204193186350762,0.09365351536832106,0.10001676296879158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028011402395995894,0.0,0.0,0.03474360599887872,0.0836045556907673,0.6628111459432243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03287140945305292,0.031786519581242886,0.08473535012751944,0.0,0.038734931415593775,0.0,0.0,0.11346212769426835,0.0,0.03812132508009368,0.0,0.03234721039375131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03494758511906335,0.029665606651544846,0.0,0.13377009976527177,0.0,0.0,

The 14 year old saw Dark Knight 6 times in the theater.In watching, I was reminded of the terror wrought in Mumbai a couple of weeks ago. The whole world was shocked and disgusted by the senseless killing spree perpetrated by a gang of thugs hyped up on drugs and somehow convinced that shooting and stabbing innocent people supported their ""cause"".I suppose if a film crew was able to recreate the Mumbai melee and amp it up with state of the art special effects and high definition, explosions, pounding music and high profile actors, the resulting movie would be huge hit.It bothers me that violence and evil are such a huge attraction for mainstream audiences, especially our younger generation. That they're all ""gaga"" over Heath Ledger and his portrayal of the criminally sadistic Joker - and his subsequent suicide - is a sad testament to what's important to our youth today, and who they look up to.In summary, I can't imagine how much better I would have felt if I had taken a walk down at the beach and watched the sunset instead of spending two and a half hours with this movie that left me feeling awful.",0.29411764705882354,219,0.0,0.0,0.05974554249411907,0.0,0.0,0.4992901853966549,0.05757848787279578,0.0,0.06423948201269794,0.06097079299681249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342852100494041,0.07135116902171595,0.0,0.0,0.08279317084808438,0.0,0.0666361000926645,0.0,0.048618849941256786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797143683467591,0.0,0.05711723296907255,0.0,0.0,0.0921070847608905,0.2070414043505055,0.08561756336666429,0.133224943104231,0.17474504343749492,0.0,0.040181808381285745,0.078164513526397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24068360833573002,0.0,0.0,0.10404153159836312,0.0,0.07967802000851976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23362314406838194,0.05376781684329052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054755380487074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19199426396188013,0.4058979388054342,0.08114794737381062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13507143438020405,0.0377438885428192,0.0,0.1945910847186274,0.0,0.17790620583543418,0.22097821425158512,0.0,0.1563365358326921,0.0827127711751028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038649024542812,0.0,0.0,0.068125788923665,0.0,0.15359863844941699,0.15308047199495006,0.0,

1114308,B000XJ5TPE,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,5,5,1204502400,Apollo Comes Alive,"The Apollo moon landings of the late 1960's and early 1970's have been the subject of countless documentaries over the nearly forty years since they occurred. Of all of them, only two films have captured the spirit of Apollo and of the men who took the journey. One of them is Al Reinert's 1989 masterpiece For All Mankind. The other is this film: In The Shadow Of The Moon. And this film easily rivals For All Mankind for the position of best Apollo documentary.This film takes the idea behind For All Mankind and takes it to the next level. For All Mankind showed us the astronauts as they were then with narration from interviews. In The Shadow Of The Moon, as I wrote, goes the next step further. It shows the astronauts not only as they were, but as they are now. The difference is often times amazing. To go from young fighter pilot to being one of the few men to have left our planet must have been an amazing journey as the film shows and these men prove it. Like For All Mankind, their narration and appearances are the heart and soul of the story being told.The body of the story is the footage. Where as For All Mankind brilliantly combined all the footage into one large mission, this film doesn't to a degree. It shows us highlights from the program including Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 and then makes a conscience effort not to confuse missions together. This allows for clarity that many have complained about being missing from For All Mankind. But this clarity also allows for something else as well. It allows for depth in story.While the film is always the star of a DVD release, the special features on the DVD are also terrific. From Ron Howard's introduction to the audio commentary (which offers some insight on the footage and its source) to the featureate on Phillip Shepherd's score, one gets to feel the passion the filmmakers have for the subject and the film. They do what special features are supposed to do: offer a supplement to the film.To be frank, In The Shadow Of The Moon is an amazing piece of work. Not since For All Mankind as a film of any size, shape, or form captured the spirit of Apollo. This is a film about a dream, the men who lived it, and its legacy not only for them but for us as well. I beg you to see this film. Only after that and viewing For All Mankind can one understand not only the legacy of Apollo but our need to explore Space.",1.0,442,0.05432963725366787,0.03420195140135405,0.2534942156852868,0.06324154524659961,0.04998174153452956,0.17882910608056263,0.08883622725400732,0.1882627613101397,0.0,0.023517529821588876,0.0,0.0638929268478544,0.03265934542613965,0.07728780797011149,0.0,0.027521427273566185,0.06449109196428116,0.0,0.06386962572540329,0.0,0.28273014561678755,0.0,0.30005061694234797,0.1256447781361029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13218685508128727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06740230146639187,0.03228947425621729,0.10849191577009044,0.09044836982568671,0.06947382569268189,0.0,0.025211720829549877,0.0,0.033954892987322155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108651059561994,0.28535670049058426,0.06221763768694561,0.11074164695509657,0.15310840988896127,0.02756945005820295,0.031575514043843615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029557743130546797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027788024247831066,0.0871207356619527,0.0,0.03702781779903679,0.5871079666503578,0.031300220622423026,0.09890694154449711,0.06765289280464935,0.0,0.1302486949057437,0.11646796516947157,0.0,0.2101603727993123,0.0,0.034310809286991595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057305327580334395,0.06381534645013369,0.027149333345071778,0.0,0.030956035914868483,0.05255468049153699,0.0,0.019748584432759786,0.0,0.021668681880077385,

In this film version of one of her stage plays, the plot is pretty sensible, which acts to its detriment. Mae doesn't get nearly as great lines as she usually does, and there's all this creaking plot machinery to establish her moral position and that of her no-good boyfriends. Still, it has great sets and costumes, and you get to hear her really cut loose with some of the best honky-tonk songs she ever got to sing in her wonderful adenoidal way, including ""My Old Flame"" and ""Memphis Blues."" Her accompaniment is by Duke Ellington and his orchestra (you even get to see them with her in one scene), which should let you know how special this score is.

515316,B00002RASO,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,1,1,1290211200,A Classic of the Genre,"Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the package details of the product offered on this page.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.This VHS version probably tallies closest with the version I saw streaming, as I was forced to watch it dubbed, and even though I eventually got used to the actor's voice who substituted for Franco Nero, I thought it was exremely distracting and took a great deal away from the film.  Apparently there are now new transfers, in both blu-ray and regular DVD with alternate tracks that contain Nero's own voice, which I hope to find under the tree this Christmas.  But even dubbed, this is a must see for fans of Italian Westerns, a flawed classic with crazy imperfections that just don't matter.This film is over-the-top from the very start, with Nero walking through boot-top-high mud as the opening credits roll, dragging a coffin behind him.  If you don't have a good guess at what's really in the coffin, then you just haven't seen enough Italian westerns, at least Sergio Corbucci style.  Next, the man we eventually learn is Django interupts the attractive (what else?) Loredana Nusciak as she is falling out the frying pan of getting flogged by Mexican Bandits, and into the fire of a private army of Southern marauders who intend to burn her alive.  Rescuing her puts Django in between these two forces which are battling one another for supremacy in the area - but despite the similarity in the beginning to 'For a Few Dollars More' (released a year earlier), 'Django' departs radically from Leone's film into its own bull-in-a-china-shop brand of storytelling.Turns out Django has a private grievance with the leader of the Southerners, Major Jackson, and a previous friendship with the self styled general of the bandits, General Rodriquez.  Together, Django and the general plot against Major Jackson, and cook up a plan to rob a ton of gold from both Jackson and the Mexican Army.  I thought it would be interesting to see if I could keep track of the body count in this film, and though I was able to score the first few scenes, my mental arithmetic petered out around 55 or so, which is well before Django and his bandit friends even assault the Federales garrison, and before the eventual, inevitable falling out between Django and the General.All the hallmarks of the genre are here - crosses and double-crosses, high body counts and the impression that human life isn't worth spit, impossible gunplay, sneering bandits with bad teeth, quicksand, machine guns, an iconic finale, and of course the horrible, Christ-like torture of the main character before he redeems everyone's soul with hot lead.  I don't think there's really anything more one could ask for in a picture like this.Obviously this film is going to appeal to Italian western fans, and quite possible NOT appeal to American western fans - I think there are elements within these two genres that are often diametrically opposed to one another.  Regardless, if you are not a fan of this type of film, it's doubtful that 'Django' is going to win you over.  If, however, you have enjoyed Spaghetti Westerns before but have not seen 'Django', then I highly recommend it - though I would consider watching the updated version, either in blu-ray or in the regular edition.  I thought the biggest drawback to the film was the dubbed voices, especially Nero's, and I'm excited to watch it as it was originally filmed.  But even in this dubbed, slightly washed out version, I'd still rank 'Django' on the same level as 'Duck You Sucker', and much better than 'Fistful of Dollars' and 'A Few Dollars More'.  A genre classic.",1.0,628,0.0,0.0,0.02435507037919664,0.0,0.02641164241959529,0.2907628179045356,0.1408300669066011,0.13264387034117056,0.05237401955790757,0.024854539644676682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168174556665715,0.027370458155605234,0.0,0.0,0.10548313601888507,0.03375035891791309,0.12879460227584422,0.24447584804181946,0.03265946749979641,0.09909655705205668,0.1062303105137729,0.0,0.026598933965493246,0.02746635938369658,0.0,0.028146278324898556,0.06985094640141541,0.028960086227145614,0.06993886628587617,0.03754714474297276,0.02813324511397995,0.0,0.10861740408122998,0.19589413783172085,0.06825036677705797,0.11465985765049434,0.11152225789856354,0.036711762843412835,0.05602279877864503,0.05329009633429543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643175624324527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03248047810719188,0.056538932595160525,0.0,0.06889682941549496,0.2698344622151243,0.06575481159032048,0.07022249382761776,0.03236257440630722,0.058273636274887,0.0,0.14204933942485962,0.0,0.0,0.06319654478672511,0.06247629781006581,0.0,0.03717910315951684,0.0,0.026222678058737223,0.0,0.0,0.03252498328460846,0.09783227367242342,0.565331697564664,0.0,0.0,0.07149906980224745,0.08365690073415429,0.0,0.1692478678436873,0.0,0.23797321267705723,0.0,0.07252286920726086,0.030027009746634012,0.029018716810879742,0.10621677573742022,0.0674351685207748,0.0,0.03472291767804221,0.030281614331984674,0.0,0.057385634211649515,0.0,0.09814781072566137,0.055542499560949726,0.0,0.16697058864054146,0.06240274191977811,0.13740349014254197,

700372,B000065UHB,AJNW2SVETWAW1,4,5,1342137600,A young man's view of what it's like to grow old -- is eternal life really worth everything?,"Ron Howard's COCOON (1985), while an entertaining and charming film on many levels, is really a young man's view of what it's like to grow old.  The story revolves around a group of senior citizens living in a Florida retirement community who discover that their neighbor's indoor swimming pool doubles as a Fountain of Youth.  Wilford Brimley, Don Amici, and Hume Cronyn are the three friends who first discover the magic water, to the delight of their wives and girlfriends (Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, and Jessica Tandy).  There are a lot of funny scenes about renewed libido, break dancing, and suddenly being able to read the bottom line on the eye chart at Motor Vehicles.  And it's fun watching these old timers getting a new lease on life.The parellel story is about aliens, who have returned to Earth to collect their friends who have been hibernating for ten thousand years in rock-like cocoons at the bottom of the ocean.  Brian Dennehy plays the head alien, Tahnee Welch plays his gorgeous lieutenant, and Steve Guttenberg plays the human boat captain who helps them retrieve the cocoons.  The aliens have been storing these cocoons in the above-mentioned swimming pool, and using their alien super powers to charge the water with life-restoring energy.  This is why the senior citizens are suddenly running around like college kids with all the energy in the world.All this works, and it's a cute film with plenty of screen time for some older actors who deserve to play center stage.  What doesn't work, however, is the film's final act.[***SPOILERS AHEAD*** PLEASE STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM]Brian Dennehy offers Brimley and his friends the chance to return with them to outer space, where they will be productive again and will live virtually forever.  But the price of such longevity will be never seeing their families again.  That means Brimley and Stapleton will never see their daughter again, or the little grandson who has been so much a part of their lives.  There is a horrible scene where Brimley takes his grandson fishing and tells him he'll be going away to a place where he'll never get sick and he'll never die, but he'll never see the boy again.  There's also a scene where Brimley and Stapleton are discussing Dennehy's offer.  Brimley asks her, ""Are you having second thoughts?""  She admits she is, and that she doesn't want to leave her daughter and grandson.  Brimley then ignores that little problem and wonders if what she really objects to is ""cheating nature.""  He says, ""The way nature has been treating us lately, I don't mind cheating her a little.""But the problem with all this isn't that it's cheating nature.  It's that living forever just the sake of living forever doesn't make sense.  Hume Cronyn gets it right when he tells his wife (who leaves him briefly when she realizes he's returned to his womanizing ways), ""I don't want to live forever if you're not with me.""  Well, he's absolutely right, but it's not just about husbands and wives being together.  I'm old enough to know that living forever would be painful without my sons, their future children, and the rest of the people who have been so important in my life.  I can't imagine anyone willingly giving up their children and grandchildren for eternal life without them.  What would be the point?I say this is a young man's view of what it's like to grow old because it's all focused on fear of death.  It's not death that frightens us older adults, it's loss.  And there would be no greater loss than that of my children and grandchildren.  It's all very wonderful that Amici can break dance, and Brimley gets a ""boner,"" and Cronyn's cancer goes into remission.  But it makes no sense that any of them would walk away from everything they know and love just to live forever in an alien universe.  A young man - Howard was 30 when he made this film - might think the chance to live forever would trump everything else.  But I don't think many older people would.I still like a lot of things about this film (thus the three stars), but it irritates me every time I watch it.  And I always cry when Brimley tells his grandson he's leaving him.  Think about that for a minute - what he's telling this little boy is that he'd rather live forever without him than ten or twenty more years with him.  What does that say about the value of this child?  And what does it say about Brimley?  It creates a depressing ending to what could have been a very uplifting film.",0.8,782,0.1558646338160202,0.0,0.09444698680397427,0.02591881913574858,0.040968882524035403,0.31571529244146357,0.0910212621276311,0.01714607222327647,0.040620439662387466,0.115660665707363,0.027385129063910996,0.15711468230882875,0.0,0.11086431362921573,0.0,0.04511736030988739,0.0,0.10908134473854425,0.0,0.0,0.14747561148073204,0.02533015300676659,0.06148614523707143,0.020597626241816148,0.025185590875080602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04365959344224842,0.09029210085489676,0.26953167508710607,0.0813651746228904,0.14560478080554137,0.13091813024540397,0.0,0.06318142200096726,0.08287217149241993,0.026466938464958043,0.11433641777337977,0.21005892988750932,0.0,0.06517556042237466,0.10332733486097477,0.02566209948211328,0.05566408769301353,0.05073034881256103,0.022345022519617053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025191331738437912,0.06577601794105828,0.050578911199362794,0.05343526286172496,0.20927923011758484,0.0679978197654043,0.0,0.0,0.04519608665122151,0.0,0.0,0.05725577683176997,0.0,0.049014214605816925,0.0484556027386285,0.0,0.1441775454071306,0.0,0.04067576714036354,0.022777203555381344,0.04760724049969722,0.05045169846365645,0.21245594684560698,0.3529085119720838,0.23090463038257517,0.10809565638814372,0.02772675913873523,0.08651057954047461,0.04270474230527484,0.09546610894990773,0.04615767002347807,0.23378633854440647,0.0,0.0,0.023288461491990108,0.0450128917064674,0.01647600152287259,0.026150811195543276,0.02767826687359367,0.0,0.023485928676756574,0.0,0.20028314997518476,0.09191197591080623,0.0,0.19385037601107605,0.09509540103440567,0.11331221913465117,0.14519566195127956,0.053283958610103314,
1695898,B00JA3RPAG,AE62TIY3899YL,0,1,1401321600,A great father/daughter relationship film,"Kevin Costner&#8217;s had a rough go.  He went from being an Oscar winning actor with Dances With Wolves to laughing stock of the industry with The Postman.  He&#8217;s tried to broaden his horizons by taking more complex characters, but it turns out he is really awful at any other character or accent than his own (if you don&#8217;t believe me, watch Thirteen Days to see him butcher his role with a New England accent).  However, like Clint Eastwood before him, he is making somewhat of a renaissance in his older age, headlining two wide release films being released in the first half of the year.  Last night, I was privileged to see one of these films, 3 Days to Kill.  In it, Costner proves that he still has the ability to be a leading man whilst expanding his repertoire to include &#8216;repentant old man.&#8217;WHAT WORKEDWhere this film really works is in its portrayal of Costner trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter.  While Hailee Steinfield gives a somewhat flawed performance as his teenage daughter, Costner more than makes up for it with his moving execution of the lead role.  It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the script/story was written by Luc Besson, the fellow behind Taken, another film that deals with an estranged father/daughter relationship.  I did not expect this kind of emotional depth in a McG film.McG films (yes, that&#8217;s the director&#8217;s actual legal name) are known for some pretty great action set pieces, and this movie is no exception.  Costner&#8217;s swagger combined with some great fight/infiltration choreography make this pretty fun to watch.The cinematography was generic, yet pretty with Paris as the film&#8217;s backdrop.  The soundtrack was above average, but a little too manipulative in certain scenes (always remember that I&#8217;m a soundtrack snob).The film was VERY funny.  I&#8217;ll leave it at that.WHAT DIDN&#8217;T WORKThe big elephant in the room is actually a petite, beautiful bombshell by the name of Amber Heard.  The film starts out with her as a normal-looking CIA agent in Langley.  However, she goes Gaga throughout the film.  And I mean literally: she basically becomes the Lady Gaga of spies, dressing in strange and provocative outfits, changes her hair colors every scene, and having some sort of weird stripper fetish that is never explained.  She&#8217;s just weird and completely out of place in the movie.  I took my mother with me to the screening, and as we walked out we both said to each other, &#8220;What was up with her?&#8221;  I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but the worst part of this movie is Amber Heard.  Her character-or lack thereof-really damaged the film.  I wanted to walk out feeling great about father/daughter relationship, yet all I could think about was how &#8216;WTF&#8217; Heard&#8217;s character was.  I suspect that they edited out a lot her character development in order to get a shorter running time and to get the much sought after PG-13 rating.CONCLUSIONAlthough a very flawed film, the father/daughter relationship makes 3 Days to Kill worth seeing, although maybe not in the theater.  Costner&#8217;s performance is solid and I&#8217;m glad to see that he still has it in him.3.5/5 Stars",0.0,528,0.06318671912595879,0.03977771997016511,0.026801825128361677,0.0,0.05813000828669024,0.12798935216321206,0.025829685340526758,0.09731301016946323,0.05763560899661564,0.0273514719863655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741573192271007,0.09036043276593514,0.0,0.0,0.03869338802354962,0.0,0.0,0.2690363372105723,0.0359404971156494,0.04362079109737391,0.029225600269191427,0.07147076103014091,0.0,0.09067703968657392,0.035759831971698096,0.06194780946496373,0.0,0.19121681555686842,0.19241263058215743,0.12395759796243723,0.2476764974515661,0.03840800276431729,0.02988232660341987,0.27436693437878645,0.0,0.1442043381472437,0.10519370326167005,0.040399893433421985,0.030825475613266654,0.029321858257599615,0.0,0.0,0.07198037669518521,0.06340989864537203,0.0,0.07000948069709277,0.0,0.03574352612251624,0.031109468393367555,0.03588275229896515,0.07581833043972383,0.22707369480151895,0.0,0.025759057838087705,0.0,0.06412791195903711,0.07344621602498987,0.18758384988037766,0.0,0.0,0.10431807724546306,0.1031291707949519,0.0,0.12274255082775395,0.0,0.0,0.09695448959183847,0.033774527327298784,0.07158500474230343,0.19378922787315914,0.394518895139485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03029649420667284,0.10159135475138643,0.03274614262892038,0.2793391309314287,0.038928141812103606,0.03990432439810027,0.0660871557196824,0.06386797995697704,0.18702001051538897,0.07420982842813792,0.0,0.07642249051748239,0.0,0.0,0.09472604938566548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25264904255627324,0.0,0.02520121585560131,
707792,B000069I09,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,4,4,1235779200,The Apartment Building From Hell (Great Psychological/Supernatural Thriller From Roman Polanski),"Strange.  Bizarre.  Creepy.  These are words that can be used to describe Roman Polanski's ""The Tenant.""  They can also be used to describe the residents of the Parisian apartment building into which Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) moves.  The former resident, Simone, leaped from the window and laid, wrapped like a mummy, in the hospital before dying.  Soon, Trelkovsky believes that there is a conspiracy among the neighbors to force him to also commit suicide  Does this diabolical conspiracy exist only in his insane imagination or is it real?  The viewer never knows for sure and this makes the film highly provocative.Having watched Polanski's occult masterpiece, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" I can't help but believe that Trelkovsky is part of a complex Satanic conspiracy.  The neighbors are Satan worshippers who have conspired to drive him insane and force him to commit suicide as a type of human sacrifice.  They treat him as though he is Simone, giving him her mail and serving him her hot chocolate and Marlboros.  He receives her photograph of the Egyptian sarcophagus from the Louvre.  Next, he sees Egyptian hieroglyphics on the wall of the communal bathroom - the wall upon which residents have been seen staring as though entranced.  There is also the human tooth embedded in his apartment wall.  Simone's tooth?  It would imply that part of her lives on in the apartment, preserved like a mummy, for eternity.  Perhaps it is her soul, or ghost, that compels him to wear her clothes and put on a wig.Commentary from Roman Polanski, explaining the mystery behind the apartment building and its residents, would've been nice.  As usual, Paramount has provided us with an awesome reproduction of the film but has not taken the time to add special features except for a short trailer.  There are, however, English subtitles for us hearing impaired.""The Tenant"" is highly recommended for fans of psychological horror, fans of occult thrillers, and fans of Roman Polanski's works.

1126839,B0010X73ZG,A1IAQIZSXONWVU,3,8,1211760000,Stupid People Doing One Stupid Thing After Another...Maybe We Should Just Shoot Them.,"There should have been another line from one of the soldiers about 40 - 50 minutes into The Mist:  ""These may very well be the stupidest people on the planet... maybe we should just shoot them."" Ok, so I stole that line from the hilarious ""Ruthless People."" Still, it would have made the only truly sensible line in the movie.Through out this movie the characters do things or fail to do things that no one in their right mind would or would not do in a crisis situation.  Plus you get the Bible thumping zealot who shows up in just about every Stephen King adaptation movie these days and it is really getting rather tiresome, even if you don't like religious zealots.  Enough!  There are many situations that are just downright stupid and I'll point a couple of them out:1.  Going to the pharmacy next door to get pain killers for a guy who has been injured and is in terrible pain.  Knowing that everyone who steps foot outside the door and into the mist ends up dying violently, why would at least 1/2 dozen people go to get the drugs when, at most it might take two heros for this mission?2.  When the star and starlet decide it's time to go, there's eight people who go out into the mist to get into our hero's SUV.  Of course half of these people don't make it.  Um... if YOU or I were leading this courageously stupid group of people, would it not make more sense for 1 or 2 people to make a run for the truck and then drive it right up to the doors to collect the others? I mean, what father in his right mind would risk his 8 year old son so recklessly when the kid could simply wait inside for the truck to pull up? Ridiculous.The Mist is one of my all-time favorite short stories. If memory serves me correctly (it's been at least 20 years since I read it), the mist is never explained and that's part of the story's magic.  In the movie, we get the tired old ""the military was messing with stuff it had no business messing with"" explanation. Why was there a need to explain it?The acting was good, the effects were pretty good, especially the flying creatures being torched in the store.  Then again, wouldn't YOU or I have had the common sense to have a fire extinguisher handy so as not to burn down our shelter?  These are really STUPID characters.When the bag boy is being pulled off the loading dock by the tentacles, wouldn't it have made since to simply lower the loading dock door, thereby severing the tentacles? Wouldn't YOU or I have at least TRIED that approach?  More stupidity.  These folks don't deserve to survive in a survival of the fittest world.  Makes one wonder how they managed to stay alive throughout life.The logical arguments with the attorney are just lame. No one would be THAT stupid after being shown that tentacle with all the teeth.The irony in the ending just seemed like the screen play writer was trying way to hard too do something shocking.  It was awful.I had high hopes for this movie, now I wish I'd Mist it (ah ha ha ha).",0.375,550,0.054885972802196516,0.034552179423396244,0.046561817590562056,0.0,0.0,0.09727863187234977,0.08974591032418532,0.021132285800493308,0.1001282076861837,0.047516698708509414,0.0,0.09682078573938896,0.0,0.0,0.026163305220829332,0.0,0.1303029616416783,0.10083088370762859,0.0,0.030778553933779772,0.0,0.0,0.11367117585302057,0.050772552324012364,0.15520438077473442,0.05085161701945179,0.0,0.09318634637907972,0.026904908440267578,0.13354044863072626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05378490009811725,0.03336239995158982,0.07787018797188273,0.17023125277907503,0.1304804740402952,0.07828776650963151,0.21320730955456252,0.0,0.1338798911802855,0.05093977776020677,0.0,0.03430259113091795,0.03126221025741418,0.055079833556512685,0.03296045061662802,0.10135406370698129,0.0,0.0,0.027022663302480095,0.09350666377326666,0.06585818792280088,0.12138052776200942,0.020951582123021752,0.11187564154843557,0.030935248036782173,0.16711056755276446,0.0,0.08147061775862931,0.24698420629156523,0.0,0.060409309948591096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519844123812572,0.0,0.029337617365412395,0.0,0.14962793078508305,0.5667590661142035,0.03162073491792143,0.06661316582713138,0.06834565850548206,0.10662303691534734,0.026316488338547165,0.058830298633985666,0.056888660103556206,0.2578079328165331,0.03381420909795887,0.034662152013909056,0.11481076661613976,0.02773886870009792,0.10153216681253811,0.0,0.03411306323795115,0.06638298038005644,0.02894606710063074,0.06446881567184257,0.027427342550032884,0.11328017974859869,0.0,0.10618568096152305,0.0,0.07980323984108015,0.20877681000575593,0.10945284603838248,

It was exactly what I was looking for: 50 minutes workout, hi energy, fun...When I actually tried it I found it to be very frustrating: the instructions are not clear and sometimes misleading, the choreography is too complicated to follow at home - she turns around all the time, so if I do what she does I find myself with my back to the TV, and this is the point when she makes a change in the move ... moreover, if I follow her exactly I find I do twice the same side. I tried doing the workout several times, because I liked the music etc - but thanks, I stay with Gilead, Karen Voight and even my old Jane FondaBottom line: If you know and love Kathy's style than you will probably love this one as well, otherwise - don't touch it.",0.25,186,0.0,0.10070724651054287,0.1357110468955407,0.0,0.0,0.20252315945793412,0.06539430844274674,0.06159305580592343,0.07295947941914356,0.13849418387092557,0.0983743542381723,0.0,0.0,0.11378652402268155,0.0,0.0,0.18989326719889524,0.0979619889963121,0.0,0.0897084777276989,0.0,0.0909923571650639,0.11043694222099712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07652386809677479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09742813934188856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22696375009550354,0.04961632239560694,0.0,0.13690850531946544,0.17754944583174795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843695867970538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23628419914358936,0.0,0.1279687104462492,0.0,0.0,0.06521549725638692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310753465327192,0.0,0.14611770922229372,0.0,0.0,0.09061767145588873,0.0,0.46099534717129526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17146928169775336,0.16581009974797672,0.17680421816441425,0.09855632692394903,0.0,0.0,0.08084888232007682,0.11837198257909237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436743394079661,0.0,0.15988179000048525,0.165085606423078,0.0,0.0,0.08540172155065659,0.17444842874890512,0.0,0.12760636152293311,

The humor in this film is so clever, so refined that is one of the best comedies ever. The humor is not juvenile or full of pop culture references, is a broad humor that will appeal to children and adults alike. But, this movie is not only a comedy. Being a Pixar film, expect excellence in every area of the production. The story is awesome, the characters are endearing, the animation superb and the action sequences jaw-dropping. Is amazing how this was only Pixar's fourth film and they already were showing how good they are. Monsters. Inc. is an instant classic that will entertain you, move you and make you have a wonderful time.Picture & AudioLike with every Pixar film on BD, it's not surprinsing that Monsters, Inc. debuts on HD with a completely mesmerizing transfer. You will see every detail in crisp clarity and awe at the level of animation that this movie has. Some aliasing appears in Sulley's fur but I think is inherent to the source and shouldn't bother you. An amazing transfer through and through.Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is demo quality. it will envelop you with Randy Newman's amazing score and you will be literally transported to Monstropolis. An audio presentation that can't ger any better.Bonus Features:This is a 2-disc BD set that its full of chocked full goodies. You have everything from the 2-Disc CE DVD that includes hours upon hours of making of featurettes, trailers, two shorts, an audiocommentary, publicity and much much more. New to this BD is an excellent piece called ""Filmmakers Round Table"" where Peter Docter and crew sit down and reminiscence about the making of the film. Also you have a view of the new ride of MI in Tokyo and an interactive game.A DVD copy is also offered.Closing Thoughts:Monsters, Inc. is another Pixar film that everyone should own.

I was so pleasantly surprised. I thought the movie was a little slow-moving but in the end it was very true to real life.  In the end I realized that if it didn't include all of the seemingly boring bits it wouldn't have all tied together so nicely. If you decide to give this movie a try, please watch through to the end- you'll be glad you did.Another disclaimer- this is probably more enjoyable for women than men. Some men will watch romantic comedies in hopes of at least seeing a hot actress in a sex scene or flitting around barely clothed.

In addition to being one of our best actresses of the day, she is also a very fine writer and not at all afraid of jumping into 'family movies' that bundle fun as well as sage advice.  Her she has written and stars in NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS and lets hope this isn't her last visit.Nanny McPhee appears as a grotesquely ugly woman who arrives in households besotted with potential disasters and in the course of her manipulations of the microcosm that initiated the problems she has a sense of magic in reversing the behavior patterns of children and adults to bring about a happy ending to a crisis waiting to happen.  This trip finds her visiting the farm of Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose husband (Ewan McGregor) is off at war, leaving the care of the three children and the farm and life in general in her hands.  Add to that the constant interference of Isabel's pestering brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans) and a battery of spoiled cousins and the madness of a misplaced bomb form the sky and Nanny has her hands full teaching the children not only how to cope but also how to behave in a manner that aids Isabel's survival.  Maggie Smith joins this irrepressible cast and in the end it is difficult to judge what entertains most - the madness or the glee.  Deep it is not, but it is one of those films you can slip into the telly and enjoy as much as an adult as the youngsters adore it. Fantasy, a bit of family drama, and a lot of fine lessons make this a fluffy movie nearly everyone can enjoy.

This treasure has only gotten better with time; it delights the eye, the ear, the mind, the funny bone, and the heart.One could easily enjoy KOH with the sound off, no small French village has ever looked more picturesque, or been populated by more visually appealing citizens.  Fellini admirers will find the surrealistic parades familiar; they dance on the surface of reality like bubbles in the sun.  Director Philippe de Broca created these film paintings without irony; their fragile magic is simply superimposed on top of the dumb, grim, WWI setting.Factoring in the superb Georges Delerue score gives you a long succession of movie moments that are poignant at least, and sometimes truly haunting in their beauty.  Alan Bates carries the film with a seemingly effortless performance; he makes the familiar look ludicrous and the bizarre seem totally reasonable.  On many levels this is a very silly movie that never could work without such a reasoned, level performance.KOH has really been damaged by over-analysis.  It is an enchanting, light-hearted comedy that casts a very particular spell.  It is not a daring, bare-knuckled indictment of war, (although it would be hard to miss its anti-war position).  It is also not a manifesto proclaiming the wisdom inherent in mental illness.  This said, KOH does invite viewers to ask - Who is more crazy, people who shoot each other or people who dress up and play pretend?In the real world, mental illness isn't adorable.  There aren't costumes and parades.  There is only pain.  In the real world, war is not always moronic and pointless; there is also nobility and valor.  But that's the real world; KOH is a movie, an exquisite movie.",0.9473684210526315,343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982829917960888,0.14205599471273647,0.20851714137632177,0.04208109548822766,0.0,0.046949266584818454,0.08912070660000986,0.0,0.12106251869608169,0.0,0.03661069056846236,0.09814201371925156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09740165796494907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04924294295929802,0.0,0.20184773070321185,0.08348797696476153,0.05192096463378299,0.06269479611480018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22349597008622613,0.06118118661457476,0.3524013035809061,0.14281585358588642,0.06581852434023425,0.0,0.04777045871690679,0.0,0.06433677513145859,0.0,0.15495879825574682,0.0,0.15207699221294563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691861561348614,0.1235213809587566,0.17074289716535743,0.11788822796673669,0.04196603087806884,0.17406330230118888,0.10447563534097098,0.05982839490784066,0.0,0.13235291160497725,0.0,0.05665082522739856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04701321430509312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24555743288077844,0.44497425737581026,0.11861355336927466,0.0,0.0,0.19997854750024943,0.09871662382732967,0.08275508283803816,0.10669843915416577,0.11377313048293851,0.0,0.0,0.05383379382523697,0.10405216044164751,0.0,0.0,0.06398130305110156,0.0622528319357522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05311611463636516,0.0,0.14936869314322904,0.05495582237984228,0.1122571851093287,0.055939242218672615,0.041057208280237165,

The 138 minute running time for the &quot;director's  cut&quot; scared me a bit, but I was interested in seeing the  &quot;new&quot; stuff so 2 1/2 hours it was!  I'm not a fan of the  &quot;Superman&quot; movies and normally would not waste time on such  stuff, but if you like really BAAAAD movies, this one BITES big-time!  From the ultra-cheesy effects (you won't believe your eyes!), to the banal  dialogue (&quot;I want the oxyhedron so I can rule the world!&quot;), to  Dunaway and Vaccaro trying to ham it up (and failing miserably), to the  non-existent plot (Supergirl spends more time with her schoolmates eating  at Popeye's than she spends on her mission), to the rampant product  placement (the Popeye's restaurant is the biggest building in this town and  you get to hear about almost every item on it's menu!) to the very bad  acting from all involved (WHAT was Mia Farrow doing in this? ), to the  constant breaches of logic (why does Supergirl swear everyone to  secrecy! ---what difference does it make? ), to the lack of scope  (Dunaway wants to rule &quot;the World&quot; but never leaves the small  desert town -- is that town &quot;the world&quot;? ).  My friend clued me  in to what all the extra scenes were in this longer version and some of  this stuff was hysterical, too!  The final wrap-up stuff when the  characters are all leaving town....&quot;Hey!  What's up!&quot;...Reply -  &quot;Hi , See ya!&quot;,  Reply -&quot;OK - Good luck! Bye!&quot;....The  End....HUH!  Another great line - &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Reply  - &quot;Oh, I hit my head&quot;....CUT...end of scene.  I swear half of  it sounds improvised (and badly).

1241791,B001UV4XRY,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,1,1,1324166400,Edge of Darkness,"Alright, here's the deal:  Mel Gibson is a man with troubles.  He always has been, and he likely always will be.  No doubt a madman, at that.  But he's OUR madman and, as such, we're responsible for the guy.  And I may be in a minority, here, but I want a Gibson comeback more than anything right now.And, although some (many) would be opposed to this, his performance in Campbell's ""Edge of Darkness"" is a damn strong argument.  Mel is still Mel; a mad scientist of a performer who pendulum-swings back and forth between a genius and a headline grabbing anti-semitist.  But when he's the former, he ranks among cinema's most consistent badasses.It's a powerhouse performance that Gibson puts his heart into, if only to remind us of what he's still capable of.  Never forcing the envelope that bounds him between a loving father and a vengeful killer, the balance is impeccably crafted; one wrong move, and Gibson's credibility is shot to pieces.  It's a balancing act that the actor pulls off smashingly, and he makes the movie his own with the ease of a veteran.True to Campbell's track record, Darkness spawns the thrills and shocking, albeit surprisingly classy, action that restrains itself long enough for the intriguing plot to unfold.There's an offset to being in the film that marks the attempted comeback of an actor, and Winstone and Huston get the brunt of it.  Supporting performances are strong, as one would expect from both, but the film was made to belong to Gibson, and there's only enough room for them to wriggle into their characters before their screen time is over.  Winstone, especially, feels half-baked, and his interactions with Gibson throughout the film mark the more needlessly obscure moments in an otherwise brisk, taut and matter-of-fact flick.It's not a film that is build upon a foundation of trickery, despite the mysterious nature of everything.  Rather, we put aside thoughts of the inevitable conclusion for the joy of the ride that Gibson puts us through.  It's light, sure, perhaps no more of a thinking man's action film than a Michael Bay effort.  But Campbell is a man who knows his audience and his genre, and you better believe that Gibson's still got it.",1.0,373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11830350906642875,0.3690105288925482,0.035044922051223,0.06601564848736095,0.039099110152380406,0.11132890599845462,0.0,0.050410124567881076,0.0,0.15244598344310423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20278901199212152,0.0,0.11836669348980736,0.03965239490266002,0.04848466437399882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04202444058692111,0.0,0.30267660480630376,0.0,0.05606061786377482,0.25202988633077134,0.0,0.04054342097938542,0.10635788907193532,0.10190276137221366,0.19565200749423056,0.14272357880026457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05357933873512829,0.0,0.12904889815767856,0.05148296645319697,0.03166223618975224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09736922774878305,0.03428932570263879,0.3080865999446258,0.0,0.069898193659553,0.09663935456607643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04384828909666718,0.0,0.09712433110032193,0.26292725968775016,0.41174699532500453,0.09878076328140482,0.05202361189639428,0.0,0.08327055804694551,0.0,0.022972670536526914,0.044428958416623976,0.21318678843402886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03171787424103523,0.0,0.0,0.10368768290581432,0.0,0.0,0.04284046273600801,0.044234829808933784,0.0,0.08292899138936645,0.045766929050153,0.09348721216030838,0.09317183216897429,0.03419223399790677,

This tale is more cerebral.  Batman is coming to terms with his place, with himself, with his city.  It is an entertaining movie, but it is far from epic.  There should have been many more battles between Batman and the bad guys.  The Sandman is in this film, but he does nothing.  I felt like this was more of a drama than a superhero tale.  The acting is great.  The worst actor is actually Christian Bale, unfortunately, with his stupid sore throat Batman.  Give him a lozenge.  I want to see Batman kicking butt.  This film had too little of that.  As I said, Batman was a dud in this film.  Bane and Catwoman and Levitt's cop character were more promising and interesting personalities.  It is worth a watch, but do not expect anything supremely entertaining.  It has some thrills, but nothing like the previous two movies.",0.0,163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07569872932008496,0.1666717692086478,0.0,0.06336203480146019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935352081152425,0.0,0.23410904364868254,0.0,0.0,0.0976735416629731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23356506639770835,0.0,0.0,0.07611699599571788,0.0,0.0,0.0787216664288946,0.09313516102068398,0.08067039036934372,0.133467097587477,0.08300285508819971,0.1002263173152804,0.10761432785912668,0.24189910717541102,0.0,0.0,0.10208264893551769,0.0,0.37557487025817643,0.1826487421117573,0.0,0.0,0.15273539273946046,0.0,0.10285124825288637,0.0,0.3302974759677841,0.0,0.12155807038576485,0.09980070569743724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658220133641546,0.09098539193635775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08953203821463931,0.0,0.0,0.10868504515161873,0.0,0.08417146186966372,0.0,0.0932202498688679,0.11215930741213986,0.2371176656895933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799233532927837,0.0,0.26459092958177854,0.0,0.09094105559300086,0.10138690692886174,0.10392933840349348,0.0,0.0,0.12177167671835148,0.09663837801925433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09665010640053086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392782166499829,0.08942662849909933,0.0,

365032,6303224407,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,7,9,1166054400,A fabulous THE NUTCRACKER production,"I hate ballet.  It is so boring, and I start craving dialogue after about twenty minutes.  All that dancing gets so monotonous!  So it was startling to watch Emilio Ardolino's film version of George Balanchine's THE NUTCRACKER (1993) on videocassette and just adore it.  The sets and costumes, by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, use color to perfection.  The Tschaikovsky music is glorious.  And the dancing, by the New York Ballet, is outstanding.  I could even follow the story with just Susan Cooper's minimal narrative read by Kevin Kline.  It is a great ensemble cast, and Macauley Culkin fits in nicely as the Nutcracker Prince.  Bart Robinson Cook as Godfather Drosselmeier is magnificent, and newcomer Jessica Lynn Cohen is enchanting as Marie.I clearly don't have a lot of experience in stage NUTCRACKER's, or any live ballet.  A NUTCRACKER expert may pan it for something.  Leonard Maltin asininely called it ""much too stagey""!  Leonard, they call it filmed ballet!  Of course, it is stagey!

Now they team up with PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, Anderson's latest cinematic attempt.  Sandler plays Barry Egan, the owner of a small business, who one night calls a phone sex line and finds himself in the middle of a quarrel which he sure as hell didn't expect to get involved with.  While this is happening, Egan discovers true love with Lena Leonard (the wonderful Emily Watson).  Sandler is in his best performance - you can't help but feel a lot of sympathy for his character, who suffers from anger control problems and is constantly being embarrased; however, some viewers may turn down the film, as it will put of those who have nothing more than a slight interest in the film.  Anderson's directing is terrific, ranking high among today's best directions with fellow young 'uns Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith; unfortunately, his script is somewhat lacking.

1133622,B001209SMS,ACEA95FQS1AVP,1,4,1208131200,First taste of Sweeney...,"I had never heard of this musical before the movie was advertised.  I wasn't familiar with the score, so I didn't miss any of the songs they cut.  I knew the basic story from commercials, but I had no expectations going into this film.  I like Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter and that was my main motivation for seeing it.I was delighted at how well Depp can sing. He imbued his songs with real emotion and his voice is surprisingly rich. This was especially true during the ode to his razors, ""My Friends."" The look on his face as he cherishes them is scary as hell, and brought the character fully to life for me.  This was my favorite song of the movie.  Depp was also careful to enunciate clearly, so I had no problems understanding what he was singing most of the time.  Unfortunately, the same is not true for Carter.  Other reviewers have complained about how weak her voice was.  I didn't notice that so much; her voice was okay, and I thought she played the part well.  However, most of the time I couldn't tell what she was singing outside of the chorus.  Since the songs convey a lot of the plot/storyline, this was a real problem.  Luckily, she had a number of duets with Depp, and I could follow what he was singing and get the gist. Alan Rickman turned in a lovely performance as the sleazy ""villain"" Turpin, and his song with Depp, ""Pretty Women,"" was well done.  However, his role was necessarily small due to time constraints (I think) and I wish it could have been more.  The boy who played Toby had an excellent voice, and his role added some lighter moments to a dark story.  As to the lovebirds - they were unremarkable.  They sang their songs fine, but I didn't really get much out of their characters.  They were just there.  I'm not sure if their characters had songs that were cut that would have fleshed them out more, but as it was I didn't care about them in the least.The story itself seemed a bit disjointed at times and this may be due to the missing songs.  At a couple of points, I felt like it was just a series of songs strung together.  No doubt this would be phenomenal on stage, and I would love to see Johnny Depp reprise the role live.  He truly carried the film by the force of his character's charisma.  At all times he was the focus that kept the story flowing.  I can honestly say this was one of his best performances and I truly enjoyed the film because of it.  The costumes, make-up and sets were all great.  Burton gave the film an ethereal feel.  London didn't look real, per se, it looked like I could be seeing this live on stage.  The dirty streets and dark lighting captured the time period and gloomy atmosphere perfectly.  And the R rating is more than deserved.  This is not for children, or the squeamish.  The gore was in your face - literally.  Once Sweeney started murdering, the blood spatter practically hit the camera every time he slit a throat.  And the music carries it out.  ""A Little Priest,"" when Lovett and Todd decide to bake up the bodies, is simultaneously macabre and funny as they debate who would make a tasty pie (the priest is too fat, the poet might be diseased...)As to this single disc edition, I was disappointed.  There is only one extra on it.  After watching the film, I realized that additional features would have made the experience better with insights into the adaptation, and possibly deleted scenes.  I really regret not buying the two-disc special edition.Overall, Johnny Depp carried this movie almost completely.  Any shortcomings it has are likely due to adapting a long musical to film. It is very well done, and I highly recommend it.UPDATE:  I decided to give this version to my niece and buy the two-disc set.  It was definitely worth it!  The featurette on the ""real"" Sweeney Todd, and the legend was interesting and provided great background.  However, I also highly recommend buying the DVD of the stage show,Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Keepcase), with Angela Lansbury - it was phenomenal.",0.25,722,0.044052309587974556,0.027732100337989847,0.037371217066159985,0.051278386362445735,0.040526888511050664,0.2788474898013509,0.01800785530441302,0.11872763917620571,0.08036440967124948,0.07627523810681178,0.02708968378092184,0.025903274310868633,0.026481303177774754,0.047000678858463506,0.020999063377929596,0.04463061032038142,0.0,0.0,0.025893827641317257,0.0,0.12504391409202387,0.0,0.060822800122389525,0.020375408135788017,0.04982775075109805,0.0,0.04214528073883328,0.14958553417127984,0.021594285307071113,0.07145438546200326,0.15553056432587234,0.05365824267055209,0.0,0.19425857412944963,0.05355433077817091,0.02083326244742487,0.04098905129730591,0.05236279821735008,0.11310289591462983,0.17112340234481255,0.0,0.04298160796116749,0.06132755089326152,0.025385243155239864,0.0,0.02509152146445784,0.06631185772993631,0.05290910958089957,0.04880898012149894,0.0,0.04983910860686101,0.08675518854207588,0.07504985865739706,0.07047836657607413,0.19484368460386622,0.08408027906943563,0.035917230907841144,0.024829096654775385,0.02235424366011512,0.02560249599246,0.06538954659255027,0.0,0.0,0.048485423287327564,0.02396641901047793,0.029797873880994658,0.08557324899087126,0.02909339923695047,0.06035540311717778,0.02253147101439473,0.0941872567267653,0.02495369940381223,0.09007022550699036,0.5500987785849547,0.0761378362932727,0.08019709737752272,0.0,0.04278862878437447,0.105610052292961,0.15345877622012846,0.11414924155387396,0.17040514668730697,0.0271397942243665,0.05564073199559103,0.0460744264589629,0.02226363438980512,0.37485974282977663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09293020013450427,0.10348728761649713,0.06604079640952212,0.022730095203245478,0.0,0.042613114541897194,0.0,0.09607692589158112,0.11969101184570836,0.0,

It starts out with a dissertation about the inevitability of our world due to the inability to control global warming. From there quickly goes down Hill. The film deteriorates into ancient bugs locate you movie. The story was much better done in a movie called ""The Thing."" For that matter it was much better done in the movie called ""The Deadly Mantis.""This animal should be relegated to midnight television. I can't believe they gave it the blue Ray treatment.

1694467,B00IKM5MIA,A3HNBLO0KIJVTS,0,1,1403568000,Wow! Deep and thought provoking. Multiple interpretations,"I blind bought this because I liked Prisoners and the trailer very much appealed to my style of film. It is a very deep and thought provoking film. There is a lot to take in, much to view and even times to pause and think about what is happening. In the end, I let the credits roll and just sat and thought. Then I understood what the film was all about. Very cool style and brilliantly filmed and acted by all involved.The PQ is decent, but a little inconsistent at times. There are some extremely sharp shots, however some of the darker scenes seem cloudy or not as dark as they should be. There were a lot of filtered shots, hazing and other film techniques used, so much of that could have been intentional. The audio is decent, however even when blasting there were a few lines which seemed muffled or too low. Again, maybe intentional.The extras are short and simple, which I am fine with for a movie like this. There is simply a behind the scenes documentary.This movie is very odd and probably not like anything you've seen before. again, it can be taken many ways. Some may not be able to get through half of it because it's just too weird, however I loved it an couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I feel this movie is geared more toward men, and I can relate to both Jake Gyllenhaal characters. Women, which have been with men who have been in these situation may also be able to relate. There are two strong female characters in this as well as a wonderful performance by Isabella Rossellini as the mother.Rated R for nudity/sex and some language. The dislike for this film is by those who never took the time to understand it. I understood it and it touched me and I related to it. It's not all about spiders. Watch it and you will discover what the spider is to the character(s). Think about it before you hate it. Hating something usually means you don't understand it.As usual, NEVER watch the behind the scenes or making of before the movie, only after!!!Highly recommended!",0.0,365,0.16089896699166906,0.05064508919766084,0.10237244557788192,0.04682296723989176,0.03700563351730955,0.32591270497748415,0.09865925339609609,0.18584873958921702,0.036690898331835524,0.13929584093565658,0.09894378245428338,0.14191571738130845,0.0,0.02861129093633394,0.11504712137353369,0.08150559146525857,0.0,0.049264515142702345,0.0,0.09022774455123352,0.19029873040124207,0.0,0.08330714496668001,0.0,0.04549837283422815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097868905019335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09980704111982042,0.0,0.2295016397883831,0.312510046838682,0.0,0.07849414009476365,0.07466532159264616,0.0,0.050279253480603414,0.04582279478239475,0.04036681809965703,0.0,0.11884832002255027,0.0,0.13652623152394133,0.07921730068267514,0.0,0.1287094420634654,0.13343574322847754,0.0,0.0,0.04534354771015477,0.12247171872826533,0.04675594987101066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036740873538560245,0.1645902539470249,0.0,0.0,0.027414768140286733,0.347747822815601,0.0,0.0,0.05008905413560128,0.23442514937770345,0.03857356964210616,0.129346358387414,0.04169246793342824,0.22228453536662926,0.09912680846724731,0.05080628226127546,0.0,0.16263373286460847,0.02976429117041983,0.09448413289914745,0.0,0.0,0.04242789238470631,0.09449559983348489,0.12060543500425122,0.041510296191403874,0.13751594302766357,0.07782118774495082,0.04294802961486988,0.05848606755724817,0.0,0.12834499572662514,
823241,B00023P4B0,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,10,13,1104624000,The DVD Shines - The CD Disappoints,"At first, I was a little skeptical when I found out that Fleetwood Mac was releasing another live set - ""Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston"".  There were two reasons for my skeptism:  1) It was only back in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac had released ""The Dance"" on CD and Video.  This was an incredible effort by the band and I thought this was going to be very difficult to top;  2) Christine McVie had departed the band and I just didn't know whether or not the remaining four members could pull things off or not.  The good news is that Fleetwood Mac pulls through once again.  They find a way to carry on without Christine McVie and produce a solid live performance.  In fact, the level of showmanship comes very close to ""The Dance"".Fleetwood Mac's ""Live in Boston"" is actually a 3 disc set.  Two discs are DVDs and the third disc is a CD.  The two DVDs are actually from a concert done at the Fleet Center in Boston.  This performance was also broadcasted on PBS' ""Soundstage"" series.  The DVDs present the full concert - in its entirety and in the order that it was performed.  The PBS Broadcasts were 1 and 2 hour subsets - each of the subsets are reordered.  You probably will still want this collection even if you have seen the PBS set.  The DVD set provides the continuity and magic that Fleetwood Mac delivered that particular evening.This would be a 5 star collection if it weren't for the CD.  I found the CD to be a big disappointment.  The CD contains only 10 of the 24 songs.  In 2003, the progressive Rock band Rush released a DVD and CD of their 2002 Rio concert entitled ""Rush in Rio"".  ""Rush in Rio"" was originally intended to be a DVD set, but since the band found some ""magic"" with the performance, they also decided to release the performance on audio CD - in the exact order and flow that was on the DVD.  It would have been nice if Fleetwood Mac had done the same.  They clearly have ""magic"" with the DVD set, but the CD is basically a bunch of live songs.  The live songs have been somehwat reordered and you don't get a lot of the spoken words said by the band members.  While Rush released the DVD and CD separately, the Fleetwood Mac package includes both.  Another note on the CD - they could have clearly fit more than ten songs on the collection.  If you get ""Live in Boston"", get this for the DVD and not the CD.Since Christine McVie has departed - the playset doesn't include many of her songs that had her vocals.  Therefore, much of the weight on falls on Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Mick Fleetwood to make the show go on. (John McVie as always, lays low in the background doing what he does best - playing Bass).  Lindsey is going to provide some incredible guitar work on songs such as ""Come"", ""Big Love"", ""I'm So Afraid"", and Tusk.  Stevie Nicks gets an opportunity to do one of her solo songs - ""Stand Back"".  Mick Fleetwood even gets a chance to do some ""ramblings"" during a drum duet he performs on stage.  The band also gets an opportunity to perform some songs that haven't been done in a long time live - ""Eyes of the World"", ""Never Going Back Again"", ""Beautiful Child"",  and ""World Turning"".  The band also performs several new songs from the ""Say You Will"" album.  These include: ""Peacekeeper"", ""Come"" (definitely the best of the new work), ""Say Goodbye"", ""What's the World Coming To"", and ""Goodbye Baby"".The highlight of ""Live in Boston"" is going to be the performance of ""Stand Back"".  It was great to see Fleetwood Mac do this.  The song starts out with a two minute percussion intro.  During the concert, Fleetwood Mac brings in a great set of tour muscians.  One of the musicians who really steals the show (especially in the second half of the show) is percussionist Taku Hirano.  Hirano leads the two minute percussion which then explodes into the start of ""Stand Back"".  Stevie delivers the song with lots of intensity and trademark twirls.""Silver Springs"" was the song on ""The Dance"" that stole the show.  It's back on here.  There was a lot of emotion during this song between Lindsey and Stevie on ""The Dance"".  This time, ""Silver Springs"" has a slightly quicker tempo toward the end.  It doesn't quite live up to what was done on ""The Dance"", but it is still something you'll want to play over and over.  There isn't any loss of emotion between Stevie and Lindsey on ""Landslide"".""Tusk"" is back and better than ever.  On ""The Dance"", Fleetwood Mac utilized the USC Marching Band and it gave the song a whole new twist.  This time, Fleetwood Mac uses a Marching Band again, but this time uses a pre-recorded track.  However the song has no loss in entertainment value.  Lindsey is going to really steal the show when he goes into a bizarre kind of dance, then will go and do an embraced dance with Stevie.One thing to note, Mick Fleetwood does an incredible drum duet with Hirano during ""World Turning"".  It features some terrific rambling vocals and Fleetwood even gets out from behind the drum set.  It's great stuff.  Following that song, the band does ""Don't Stop"".  This is the only Christine McVie vocals song included - Stevie Nicks steps in flawlessly and delivers Christine's vocals.The collection includes some very thin liner notes.  They do list the songs with songwriting credits.  The stage and production credits are included as well.  The packaging is kind of cheap (cardbox box as opposed to jewel case). Overall, it's another solid live set by Fleetwood Mac.  As mentioned above, the CD is the disappointment - but the DVD set alone is worth the price of this collection.",0.7692307692307693,990,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916681463087043,0.07820996568717094,0.23247128692488087,0.055603330912459184,0.06546401256931919,0.031017914050541173,0.07359908414246882,0.0,0.059986668687461706,0.0408835099654018,0.06046884946178947,0.04862952237163071,0.0,0.10091377240567151,0.04164745388945838,0.15990611237058436,0.057207847573386275,0.0,0.01934219608111362,0.035213281492898034,0.047185264787181304,0.05769542374983458,0.015752914413328097,0.04879991158800486,0.07697986809682589,0.0500079342368806,0.06894737346610426,0.05145383950319156,0.0621307404384641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432741524563429,0.20039138080921023,0.040420499103912426,0.13581197852183366,0.11322476861900464,0.021742121649872544,0.01658943090538876,0.0,0.01959567160543734,0.02125264893873628,0.0,0.017062739687986724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019236191660551103,0.016742268080140593,0.01931111939446177,0.0408033592075513,0.21620862363436053,0.23365521052624438,0.0415884687932233,0.05749909362670952,0.0345118945737675,0.0,0.05047625794325199,0.0,0.0,0.03742743083368813,0.018500436399826105,0.023001920743535718,0.0,0.1122905724886636,0.015530081156013122,0.1043565281022822,0.0,0.03852509868568809,0.12746809925725075,0.6859547189117358,0.019591067503635564,0.0,0.0423445063132435,0.049544842626364216,0.08152373764199124,0.11845968011384683,0.07049232620134248,0.18791588449019211,0.0,0.10737709950265885,0.01778315308577904,0.051558009381063204,0.1635547434726888,0.0,0.02113522428827915,0.0,0.017933939739389785,0.039942554244388494,0.05097897826262964,0.03509215794698313,0.01937563944257616,0.016447205046281815,0.05446139308934254,0.08652561870838499,0.03695731016493153,0.08137564547195929,

This transfer to DVD is ok and the picture does appear to be cropped somewhat, but it's not severe, and does not ruin the presentation. Some of the episodes are real treats and the lessons are as relevant today as they were in the 70's. I enjoyed this as a boy and now my son enjoys it as well.

370736,6303364772,A31U2QT7SAL7K,5,6,1110412800,"""Beauty"" is in the EAR of the BEHOLDER!","Unlike an earlier reviewer, I found Darryl Hickman's commentary to be quite insightful and not the ramblings of a whining ex-child star.  Of course, the opinions are those that are singularly his, as he recalls the filming of the classic film.  Certainly, his feelings about his cast members and director are based on memories from a child mixed with experiences that he has had since he became an adult.  And for that, he cannot be criticized.As far the film itself, one can only be mesmerized by the beauty of Gene Tierney, coupled with her vivid portrayal of a woman determined to be the sole possessor of husband Cornel Wilde.  Wilde, one of Hollywood's ""pretty boys"" affords himself adequately in the part of the unsuspecting spouse while the aforementioned Hickman is impressive as the ill-fated brother to Wilde's character.And the eye-catching allure of Miss Tierney is equally matched by the Oscar-winning cinematography, which makes this one of the best-looking films of all time.",0.8333333333333334,162,0.07531641639600946,0.0,0.06389372480368001,0.0,0.13857797872037905,0.1525589471193121,0.18472862937608606,0.173990688930896,0.0,0.26081618183876654,0.0,0.0,0.09055038773225667,0.0,0.14360874297769652,0.07630513955653048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14252539900295566,0.0,0.05199449680658354,0.0696718395810315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08524900271092777,0.07383967829035573,0.0,0.30389857239232015,0.09173972002495495,0.0,0.22141645987800296,0.0,0.0,0.046719433995019065,0.0,0.08594332897992474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06024857781126677,0.45804695147981117,0.057500960728878385,0.18422351591652128,0.08490081904347253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15399343808794985,0.5064263955222463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04036447786565905,0.07806457267345765,0.12486102256902656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582783941840715,0.0,0.0,0.10950874576428873,0.0,0.0,

The program opens with Igor Stravinsky's pagan Rite of Spring, with its frightening music of human sacrifice. This is followed by Sergei Rachmaninoff's Third Piano concerto, played for all it's worth  by Yefim Bronfman. Closing the program are charming excerpts from Peter Tchaikovsky's, The Nutcracker. It's a grand program, beautifully played by the Berliners, with good sound and visuals.

1601109,B009P25VRG,AAOWC8GXIHKGM,0,0,1367366400,The sushi BITES BACK!,"Japan is known for many things: Gore splattered films, the mastery of the samurai, and delicious sushi (just to name a few). With those ingredients it's no wonder Noboro Iguchi decided to blend it all together to create DEAD SUSHI.Anyone who's seen Iguchi's other films like THE MACHINE GIRL and ROBO-GEISHA will know what to expect. The bizarre and comical story lines are amongst the many delights he has in store for us and I must say anyone who doesn't enjoy this film on some level must have a mental defect. The film begins with telling the story of Keiko who is the daughter of a legendary sushi chef. After a fight with her father she runs away from home and ends up finding work as a hostess at a rural hot springs inn. At the inn, Keiko is repetitively ridiculed by the staff and guests, including a bunch of corporate employees staying there on retreat. Little does everyone know a disgruntled former researcher has also come to the inn with a serum that turns sushi into living mutants who want nothing more than to eat human flesh. The mutant sushi wreck havoc at the inn, and it is up to Keiko and a few survivors to stop them.Noboro Iguchi has once again created a very original gem of a film, that isn't afraid to step into absurdity at times. I dare anyone to watch this film without chuckling at the outrageousness of it all, especially the scene where two mutant sushi's mate and create flying mutant baby sushi's. People have to realise this film isn't taking itself seriously and isn't out there to garner any prestigious awards. It's pure entertainment and escapism, and there's nothing wrong with that.",0.0,289,0.0,0.07137790657853595,0.09618742208358484,0.06599110465251598,0.0,0.34449983666504125,0.046349284689316636,0.043655084768319065,0.25855611619036073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05404816677276089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26820221300392577,0.0,0.0782739874021307,0.052442979820879906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16674051303285795,0.0919559713828595,0.057187189241030466,0.06905378579025968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03516637925706169,0.1347733086854848,0.12938152041159895,0.15730133874133137,0.0,0.05531382694163887,0.05261570700859179,0.0,0.14172461396090488,0.0,0.056891971498850724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438870159720844,0.0,0.18806095843226758,0.08656357407295351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589665206943403,0.056100678648106916,0.07288858225132458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341719881352177,0.0,0.0,0.057992334281992255,0.12121132423428518,0.06422675538910454,0.11591304054490575,0.408422481545155,0.0,0.06880475279209104,0.0,0.16519643540003767,0.0,0.09114874148229449,0.0,0.37593863611918404,0.0,0.07160508800161305,0.11858806463866481,0.05730296646147854,0.0,0.06658177246868006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05665941561151229,0.0,0.0,0.21935842375597445,0.06052986566215716,0.20607195743866985,0.0,0.0,

But thats how I felt that I really wanted to get this movie, but it turned out to be a waste of money as time passed because it's just in the video shelf for soo many years getting dusty.I recommend you rent this movie from Block Buster or any other video rental store because after some time you will not bother watching it and the video will just be left on a shelf or some thing.One video I would recommend is the Power Rangers in Space Video that one is worth buying because that video has taken the Physco ranger series and made a mini movie out of all the episodes and it's fun to watch for every oneJust to sum up every thing above, Rent it, dont bother buying it save you're money for the Power Rangers in Space Video or the Best of Power Rangers Ultimate Rangers DVD, because they are going to be way more fun and you'll end up wathcing it more frequently and not get bored of it.",0.6923076923076923,242,0.105210202832666,0.13246524092948958,0.04462686933340263,0.0,0.0,0.21311101269033847,0.04300819019204811,0.04050820203917004,0.0,0.13662620667427303,0.32349167976899845,0.0,0.06324533956711223,0.11225179796978953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06184227078529301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452631927265434,0.04866262048039815,0.17850554757234421,0.048738399520282014,0.0,0.0,0.051573666816406995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395194776889915,0.0,0.09789421806127793,0.0,0.06002751794873971,0.4086943009005905,0.0,0.15397956658677706,0.04882289660526708,0.0,0.06575418793388786,0.05992612163464047,0.10558181197506751,0.0,0.2719979892592809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05974723327607413,0.12624269837615812,0.1454204655327024,0.08032362705030388,0.08578118115362614,0.0,0.16016602977113184,0.061146482933202406,0.10411330717934013,0.0,0.0,0.11579781551067461,0.0,0.07116631078651674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10762389793927703,0.0,0.0,0.17926238872617617,0.17685793596631644,0.0,0.0,0.06550544908813316,0.0,0.050445732025564675,0.14096378673778925,0.10904912790639677,0.17441952417530845,0.06481801480760233,0.0,0.11003962785346252,0.0,0.0,0.061782216335189884,0.06539088439669179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05257511392299652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11233312410956042,0.0,0.057171647758380316,0.3356939646145781,

1238128,B001U0HBQA,A4KJTS5P78ICU,1,2,1241395200,Amazing Movie with a SURPRISE ENDING!!,"The Uninvited is an awesome suspenseful movie. If you like movies with a lot of twists and a lot of puzzles to be solved then you will love this movie. This movie turns out to be a lot different than I thought it would be but I won't tell you why because I do not want to give it away. There are a few parts in the movie that will make you jump but it isn't that scary of a movie. It is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie. It's a great suspense/horror movie with NOT a lot of gore which I thought was awesome.The storyline and acting was amazing as well. Emily Browning (Anna) and Elizabeth Banks (Rachel) work really well together and deliver an amazing performance.I absolutely LOVED this movie. It was 100x's better than I thought it was going to be. It's kind of on the same lines as Hide and Seek so if you like that movie, you'll like this movie as well.The Uninvited has a GREAT surprise ending.

But as a more complete portrayal of Elizabeth this surpasses all other presentations.Mirren has the edge and the requsite arerogance to carry off scene after scene with differing takes on the people of her entourage/. Her affair with Essex is documented, and if she didn't meet Mary of Scotland, she should have. The swings in mood, the nationalism Mirren exudes are fantastic, and those sets! Flowers and black back drops!And this version shows the spots of commoness of Elizabeth..ruthless, a political animal, sexually driven, unstable, and a bit psycholtic. But this waa the age of Shakespare and Spenser..so something is right with this world and indeed it is..Elizabeth I wantes her reign to be remembered forever..in music, literature of every sort, and in history. She dies on  her feet, documented..everything must be seen and never forgotten, and it has never been forgotten..look at all the films, books etc. produced and written.A great great creation by Ms. Mirren, and her Queen Elizabeth II was no surprise..a tour de force, a masterpice of brilliance in a form of expression  Elizabeth I would have applauded. Queen Eliz. II?? Never, she is a mere adjunct to Elizabeth I, a footnote, and that's why perhaps the Queen E. II film was 100 minutes, and the HBO of Elizabeth I  several hours.

I don't understand the bad reviews this movie gets, I think it is just as good as the original and without spoiling anything, the ending wasn't as dark as the original which is another thing I liked.

The positives are obvious - a good selection of Garbo's best films, a good documentary about her career and some excellent commentaries on the Silents. In fact, the Garbo Silents disk shows the loving attention of the best TCM DVDs which leads to the disappointing aspect of the collection. Most of the prints of the talkies are poor. ""Queen Christina"", ""Camille"" and ""Ninotchka"", maybe her best films, warrant restoration. ""Anna Karenina"" does not even contain a complete print.

42148,0783104146,A1BVKYCRW6W21A,6,6,1063497600,It's a bit like American Pie really,"Although having said that it has much darker tones and hasn't got the syrupy ending that most American films have when dealing with teenage lives.I got a friend from Holland to buy me this as it hasn't been released here in Ireland ( or the UK ) yet. As a result I'm listening to the whole thing in Dutch and have no subtitles to guide me along the way. But I can pick out the odd Dutch word here and there such as "" godverdomme "" "" klootsak "" and "" dood "". But then I don't really need the subtitles. I can get the meaning ( or my interpretation of it ) without them such is the strength of the film.Rutger Hauer and Jeroen Krabbe are the usual suspects in Verhoeven's Dutch movies ( which I haven't seen but for sure I'm interested in seeing ). Here they play very small parts but they play them well. Hauer is good as Gerrard Witkamp who is the idol of the three teenage wannabe dirtbike riders. He plays the role with such cockiness that you sometimes get the feeling that he IS that person.The film takes on a darker edge when one of the bikers who had just got a contract from Honda sees his career ruined when a German tourist ( this is what it's supposed to be they say - for all I know it could have been another Dutch person ) absent mindedly throws out rubbish out of his car window and leads the biker off road. His career is ruined and effectively feels that his life has become worthlessThe gang rape scene is one of the most explicit depictions of gang rape for it's time. And it's amazing to think that in Holland you can get this on a 12 certificate while here in Ireland you'd be lucky to get an 18 certificate. But needless to say you have to a bit of a strong stomach for it all.There are some obvious scenes as well such as the boys measuring up to see who has the bigger penis. And there's one where......Nah I shouldn't say more. I'd end up ruining the film for you and that's not what you wantBut when the film plunges into so much darkness you are kinda confused at how it could come into such a happy ending. It's not a syrupy happy ending with loads of schmaltz added on.....it just IS a happy ending. A sort of signal to say "" Life goes on.

The first is an incredibly over the top classic that I thought was a horror movie when I caught glimpses of it as a child. Still probably wouldn't recommend for children due to certain moments of mild &#34;gore&#34;, but when I grew up and tried these films again I realized they are TRULY COMEDIES to the core! When my son is a little older I will gladly watch these fun flicks with him. The last of the films in this &#34;attack pack&#34; is truly great with its &#34;old west&#34; feel as we are taken back to the wild west days of the 1800's with the ancestors of the characters throughout the series. Also a great cameo from the hit man of the film &#34;The Untouchables.&#34; That was a fun surprise!",0.0,153,0.0,0.0,0.07057341926350136,0.0968363180012576,0.07653272541999771,0.08425402158452212,0.13602724473060823,0.1281202275141981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05917207368218334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07871277477122511,0.1892739587198726,0.057430200443009054,0.07695560026778007,0.09409687510281078,0.0,0.15917793430671762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087999478891505,0.0,0.0,0.07868486395429825,0.05160366238178771,0.0,0.1423922601391033,0.046165259819751635,0.10637927095720695,0.08116832357621177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061448656450235214,0.0,0.0,0.08191612121468898,0.0,0.0,0.2759634176494124,0.0,0.06782764904754336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125431822485976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17009250131216297,0.6392801698152146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15955086473564048,0.04458433482346306,0.0,0.13791447160904743,0.0,0.0,0.0870089355146566,0.0,0.12311327259948598,0.09770307264615037,0.0,0.10061621622073699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2575469569275296,0.0,0.0,0.08882241554673806,0.18143581356986882,0.1808237381427694,0.13271752681091137,

1641081,B00BYCOIU6,A2UITTZE0YDER2,20,20,1367971200,To fight evil and not the victims of evil,"Eastern European cinema generally tends to be in a class of their own when compared to Hollywood and Western European films. A lot of artistry goes into their productions as well as being 'thinking' movies....making the viewer not just appreciate what's on screen at the present moment, but to make the movie remain with them for a long time after.To make a biopic of any one always poses a challenge. This is more so if the person is a hero and, in the case of Popieluszko, a beatified martyr. However this movie flows with an incredible fluidity, without adulterating or romanticizing the facts and the events. A beautiful aspect of this film is incorporating footage of actual events that happened in the tumultuous 80's in Poland, along with the Papal visits by Blessed John Paul II with the movie, that there is no `break'. One cannot really discern, in certain parts of the movie, which is archival footage and which is the film. This is a remarkable achievement in cinematic art, as far as I am concerned.From this film, one can learn much about the character of Bl.Jerzy Popieluszko. A very brave young man, who was an average priest in the opinion of many, but who did extraordinary deeds of heroism for the liberation of his homeland from the tyranny of communism. We also see his very human side of suffering, compassion, fear, anger and even a slight sense of vanity.Though the facade of this priest speaks the contrary, we are surprised to see the stuff this man is made off.  This movie beautifully expresses the underlying fervent catholicity of a nation, despite the coldness of its exterior, and how freedom and faith is both expressed with such passion, that we can easily affirm that both are inviolably linked to each other.Also expressed and wonderfully depicted, is the love the Polish people have for their traditions of faith, their love and respect of their language, culture and nation. Certain scenes pertaining to this are quite amusing as well as awe inspiring. Also, the heroism of the many priests of those days; from the Pope, to the Bishops and ordinary priests as well as the religious sisters is amazing. The words of Christ : ""This is the greatest love a man can show, that he should lay down his life for his friends"" (St. John 15:13), brings us to a whole new perspective of what sacrifice really means.The words used in my review's heading comes from a scene when Bl. Jerzy is asked how come he feels no anger for his persecutors for which he answers ""I fight evil, not the victims of evil"". He saw his tormentors as victims themselves, to be pitied and to be helped. Truly a mark of sainthood!This movie is 149 minutes long, in Polish with subtitles in English and Spanish.Special features include:1)The making of the film (21 mins)2)A documentary:Victors don't die: The story of Fr.Jerzy Popieluszko (50mins)I am not too fond of these features because only one voice over(male) was used for both features, for all the different people, both men and women.Also Included is a 16 page booklet which includes the following chapters:1.About Poland, Patriotism and Catholicism2.An Unlikely hero3.In his own words4.The rise of solidarity5.Chronology of events6.Discussion questionsThis is a movie that will make any catholic proud and more so any Polish.For a documentary on Blessed Jerzy I highly recommendJERZY POPIELUSZLO: MESSENGER OF TRUTH*A POLISH MARTYR AND 21ST CENTURY HERO DVD.",1.0,577,0.05347175196474992,0.033661889798834735,0.022681040656810817,0.1244858751956929,0.07378876671738237,0.23016081304419153,0.06557510250387888,0.18529002190779556,0.024387062908431838,0.0694385376938282,0.03288210914445184,0.0,0.0,0.038033702290162244,0.025489167740327362,0.08126056093566224,0.0,0.03274427404509864,0.031430550225508905,0.02998549752797469,0.10118753850544134,0.0,0.16611339684165,0.09892864008336304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02168326253466671,0.10787813509316625,0.0,0.0,0.18339667527640124,0.06500553362110774,0.025287914586647232,0.1824294832827627,0.03177961138299455,0.2440658007983995,0.0,0.03418840400255533,0.026086054300465795,0.0,0.09243965446472717,0.06683746505909685,0.0,0.053660617600927156,0.0,0.1382395302451337,0.032427541197772844,0.030247953835975436,0.026326383149746033,0.06073154793550803,0.06416125122073021,0.4582302713622642,0.040823465280967856,0.08719439595008234,0.030138154168320292,0.027134118132129875,0.031076924869361193,0.0,0.06874865181532802,0.0,0.05885277190173974,0.058182030626670045,0.0,0.0,0.03531426711471059,0.04884055910499062,0.0,0.02858168888895582,0.0,0.10932940412807811,0.48795150817008964,0.15402989217005697,0.032448387983683304,0.0,0.025968932919403692,0.0,0.15761472711325575,0.027711418485986867,0.16251860579656122,0.032942934404870144,0.0,0.0,0.05404826884493307,0.039566414244379615,0.0,0.0,0.09700878239934876,0.08460068254258904,0.0,0.05344127043800516,0.05518067153395653,0.12186891412679092,0.051724822433641904,0.028545943207453454,0.11662048139725002,0.0,0.0,
1221041,B001NTGZVK,A1XFI340SHOS5K,3,3,1271808000,a gold mine of info,"As others have said, this DVD is not for the beginner wanting to learn the 108 form. There are many other YMAA DVD's and books for that purpose. This is, however a gold mine of information for the serious student. Zhou, Xuan-Yun is a Wudang monk with incredible skill. It's like watching a primordial spirit swirl through the universe when you see his 108 form. I teach Yang style 24 and Chen Man'Ch'ing forms, and know what skill it takes to make this look so easy. Just the opening frames of the dvd showing the Wudang area of China are worth watching.Zhou, Xuan-Yun talks about standing meditation being the foundation of the taiji forms. Every teacher I ever studied with says the same thing. Meditate, Stand, Meditate and Stand some more. This video shows how to do this.I loved most of the warm up exercises but was not a fan of the big, fast neck circles or of the bouncing into the leg on the stretches. Be careful with these, if you are new.Most videos teach form work first and then application much later. This DVD works in the opposite way. The form movements are demonstrated using various applications. Master Yang's son Nicholas and Adison Martin are the assistants. Several applications are show for various form moves. The Chinese name and English name are show on screen to help follow along. Excellent for the practiced taiji player to finesse some of his moves. Very subtle details are pointed out to make a huge difference.I like the fact that Zhou, Xuan-Yun brings both assistants up to thank and he also says something like: I know that there are martial artists watching who are at a higher level than I am. I would like to invite them to make comments and help me improve my form. Humble, Beautiful and Powerful.

1203917,B001IDZLCK,A8F2AZWB20X1H,2,3,1301875200,A very guilty pleasure,"Will somebody please tell me why I watch this movie every time it comes on cable TV?  Am I a glutton for punishment or what?  This film occupies a prominent place on my list of Crappy Movies You Can't Stop Watching, right up there with Avatar.In fact, Twilight and Avatar share come characteristics in common: gorgeous scenery, vomitous dialogue, mediocre acting and a ridiculous story line. Sparkly vampires, give me a break.  Twilight is supposed to be a romance between a human (Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart) and a vampire who wishes he wasn't (Edward Cullen, played by Robert Pattinson) and it's one of the silliest films ever to come out of Hollywood.  But dammit, it's fun.  There are several things I actually liked about it:1) Edward and the Cullens.  Socialized vampires, yeah, right.  Bram Stoker would be turning back-flips in his grave.  But the Cullens, especially Dr. Cullen and perky little Alice, are curiously appealing.  They're a family.  They have feelings, hopes, failings, just like anyone else.  And Robert Pattinson, whom I fell head over heels in love with as Cedric Diggory in the fourth Harry Potter movie, is an impossibly gorgeous hunk.  Never mind that his acting skills are uncertain at best, I could watch this guy all day.  And unlike so many Hollywood hunks, he's never stuck on his own good looks, which is what makes him so charming to watch.2) Billy Burke as Bella's single dad, trying to be a good dad to a teenage girl and not having a clue as to how to go about doing that.  He steals every single scene he is in.3) The development of the relationship between Bella and Edward is actually done  very well, and their first meeting in a bio class is priceless.  He is intoxicated by her human scent and reacts with a wave of nausea that sends him bolting out of the classroom as if he had to make it to the loo in time to unload his lunch.  Thoroughly perplexed, she sniffs at her sweater as if she is wondering if she forgot to put on her Rite Guard that morning.  But as hard as he tries, he can't stay away from her.  They fall hopelessly in love, even while he fears he won't be able to control his lust for her blood and even though she realizes that she may end up as his next meal.  It's love and it snares them both until it's impossible for either to escape.The biggest jarring note in ""Twilight"", besides the whole ridiculous premise, is Kristen Stewart as Bella; I kept wondering what in the world Edward saw in her in the first place.  She's just blah.  But the movie has its own irresistible charm that catches us up in it and makes you want to watch it over and over.  It's campy, cheesy fun and doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy.Judy Lind",0.6666666666666666,493,0.06721413180670947,0.0,0.028510127314048044,0.0,0.03091755746265315,0.30633113946397905,0.08242807502996714,0.2329100412342718,0.061309203475750355,0.1454740385819325,0.0,0.0,0.04040464209146189,0.09561692613001967,0.09611985116577636,0.06809649148354517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075383697338501,0.03179825001238405,0.07646256503726216,0.06960165782196734,0.03108838970904282,0.0,0.062273603152624785,0.0,0.0380391020894777,0.03294812808855278,0.02725591760983158,0.3390077435649625,0.2456120164259961,0.08790562788235745,0.19759722820805387,0.0408560627287374,0.0953609239471457,0.2918546103648285,0.0,0.1725701336622247,0.20514737610151598,0.04297491307940793,0.0655804767056949,0.03119078301589294,0.11619688697416912,0.04200743402862512,0.07656828196827768,0.0,0.0,0.07447176445280064,0.04076150393709658,0.0,0.03309233234376672,0.0,0.026883620092072225,0.11148322205884033,0.10263040485415427,0.027400895832152578,0.0,0.034107657325200436,0.0,0.06651337382853019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2611318993531683,0.0,0.0613927102923488,0.0,0.03592725754538731,0.0,0.13742734639138016,0.2259733808898571,0.038723195309988856,0.040787708401406185,0.0,0.06528603294221837,0.09668262174662888,0.054033306390461014,0.06966665075406112,0.27857224327921354,0.0,0.0,0.10544915585231847,0.033969407515043175,0.0,0.15787967023193564,0.0,0.0,0.0354477596015168,0.0,0.10076372467202978,0.0,0.03829738579848023,0.03250911841288975,0.0358823251304254,0.07329612477597576,0.03652442980411624,0.05361499592441516,

307429,6302320402,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,0,0,1237593600,Making Technical Lemonade out of Lemons,"The skyrocketing cost of continuing to do a full-length animated feature with the classic hand-inked cells and the need for another Disney blockbuster handed Walt Disney with a basket of lemons; which he then turned into lemonade when his studio adapted  Dodie Smith's modern-day doggie adventure story. With the usual Disney changes, of course - simplifying the story, merging some characters and omitting some incidents, and adding one of the most flamboyant and malevolently hilarious villainesses ever created; Cruella De Vil, with her penchant for a puppy-fur coat, her crumbling country mansion and her two hapless and bumbling henchmen. Given the sight of an impossibly scrawny woman in an oversized full-length fox coat, nine out of ten Americans are probably humming the `Cruella De Vil' song under their breath. (It's one of the featured extras, sung by Selena Gomez, in case anyone has forgotten that little ditty) This movie alone has probably put as many viewers off the notion of fur coats as PETA ever did.The plot itself is as thin as a whisper:  Pongo, the Dalmatian belongs to Roger the striving song-writer, who marries Anita - who also owns a female Dalmatian Perdida; Pongo and Perdita have arranged their human pets' happy marriage, as well as their own. Their happy family is rewarded by the birth of fifteen puppies - but when Anita's old school friend, Cruella visits and decides that she simply must have  a new bespoke `Dalmatian' fur coat! Cruella has arranged to sequester sufficient puppies  in her ancient family home out in the country, intending to harvest their skins for her new coat - including Pongo and Perdita's puppies!How these devoted canine parents discover where their puppies are, and rescue them - along with all the others - with the aid of other stout-hearted dogs, cows, a horse and one gallant and able cat, Sgt. Tibbs - and bring them safely home is the rest of the movie. And a charming and witty movie it is, also, full of gentle visual jokes, daring in adversity and a suitable come-uppance for the horrible Cruella and her luckless henchmen.This release has been digitally restored; the colors are rich and clear. There is an option to watch it with one-hundred and one pop-up trivia facts; one set for the family and another for the fan.  Other notable extras include a dramatization of the personal correspondence between Walt Disney and Dodie Smith- who insisted that she liked the movie that he had done of her book. There is a collection of songs eventually omitted, and the usual ""making of"" features, and art galleries. One amusing feature centers on creating the character of Cruella - whose manner and appearances were based on the flamboyant actress  Tallulah Bankhead.",0.0,456,0.0,0.0,0.030007964793968715,0.08235000802524892,0.09762562253424074,0.4298998245816071,0.08675860147124202,0.1634309623976086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041599102442554235,0.0,0.02516008891692442,0.06744646859487233,0.0,0.04198855293705189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465166447358737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04003756362507645,0.1387164998342592,0.05737572526799132,0.07136364086853846,0.30160170001408126,0.0,0.03466306669520081,0.0430025190164629,0.0,0.10970992337857335,0.04204575415989751,0.12109097090036207,0.05888869375322919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044214379947536055,0.0,0.0,0.0424844257754062,0.10451238659759693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3324639558121458,0.054011150875091236,0.20188320307307103,0.0,0.0,0.08223214106400073,0.0700077890985475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09161699812906991,0.0,0.0,0.07236837780897645,0.07562953807187003,0.0,0.09643158088620826,0.47569070340669106,0.2445455824393086,0.08586114711125602,0.044047123166189035,0.06871596736443354,0.0,0.03791470396948474,0.0,0.09773586740854402,0.0,0.044677836525325344,0.03699638052020568,0.0,0.0,0.041543549892084246,0.0,0.0,0.03731007969309379,0.041548591766779386,0.0,0.07300633483945924,0.04030941679364454,0.10265115305215838,0.0,0.18000939985392944,0.0,0.0,

1489143,B005LAIIMG,A1J48DYGTWSPHS,1,1,1402876800,WW Z is for ZERO,If you suspend all common sense and science then you might like this absurd movie. There are so many things wrong with it that I couldn't keep up with them. Plus Pitt's character has two whiney little girls that scream and whine throughout the entire movie. Special effects somehow create more people than can be placed into one area of the world in an instant to make crowds into a weapon of the zombies. As with all zombie movies one cannot ask simple questions like &#34;How do you kill a dead person?&#34;. Or &#34;Why do dead people need to eat?&#34;.  Or how does an airplane that has been diverted to a World Health Org. location crash because of a zombie on board and the only two survivors can then walk to the WHO building when they don't even know where they are or what country they are in after the crash.

1549012,B0089J27VY,A26N400UY1CDGX,13,17,1340496000,MARILYN with Host Rock HUDSON Documentary,"Complete support for Shane CAWLEY's Comments of June 12th, 2012 should be universal.The rare Documentary MARILYN, originally theatrically released in 1963 at 86 minutes, has NEVER been released on either VIDEO or DVD and is a fascinating compilation of scenes and production numbers from Marilyn's FOX catalog with introductions on screen by Rock Hudson.Included in MARILYN, is the famous  MM costume Screen Test for SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, with the lovely title music in the background. Such footage is a gem and was, thankfully, eventually released on DVD some years ago, along with the reconstruction of the remnants of that unfinished film in which MM looked absolutely radiant.However, it has been impossible to view that film in its original color and format for five decades, since original release - it was screened on Television in Sydney once in the early Seventies in black and white before color Television arrived in 1976 here, but even that print has since completely disappeared.It was fortunate to have also viewed MARILYN at a private screening of a rented 16mm color copy of the film during 1969 but sadly, someone had already lifted the Costume Test from her final film.The real ""diamond"" from MARILYN, however, and worth every penny, or dollar, or pound or whatever, for a DVD release, is the presentation of the Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in full CinemaScope format. From dated history, that sequence was apparantly photographed in the new Anamorphic process during 1953 as a Test sequence, when THE ROBE and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE were being produced as the initial CinemaScope productions (with MILLIONAIRE being completed first but released after THE ROBE).Any true MM fan would readily pay the price of a DVD simply for that sequence alone. On the initial release of MARILYN, I was amazed that there semed to be no cropping at all heightwise of what I assumed was a blowup of the standard 4x3 print and later had knowledge of the special photographing in CinemaScope to seemingly confirm the Widescreen matter. The sequence in the theatrical print of MARILYN was very sharp with rich color.MARILYN is now possibly the ONLY MM title ""unavailable"" to home viewing in any format, with THE DANGEROUS YEARS  set for release by FOX on MOD shortly.Considering the content of MARILYN and the unababating interest in the lady herself,  its seemingly permanent abandonment by the FOX Studio is very bewildering. Let us hope that a suitable negative or print still exists for production of a very long overdue and welcome release for home viewing.Other fans could also support a movement to have MARILYN ultimately released to DVD by writing to Twentieth Century Fox itself - many, including younger generations of people,  probably don't even realise the film exists.Including MARILYN in the BluRay Box Set would have enticed me to buy the Collection being released shortly, but with the absence of NIAGARA and BUS STOP as well, it is a worry!(Only four stars above is due to omission of the neglected films).Eric GLASBY  AUSTRALIA3rd September, 2012  -  REVIEW UPDATE:After viewing the BluRay films, five stars is certainly appropriate - the quality of the prints is flawless and despite multiple viewings of all films over the years on different formats including theatrical releases, these copies are simply glowing and it feels like viewing them for the first time.Thanks to 20th Century Fox for their wonderful efforts.Eric Glasby  Australia",0.7647058823529411,571,0.0,0.07601490583976579,0.05121807421326227,0.07027815534073938,0.0,0.19872663843948515,0.049360322826536566,0.06973664507321069,0.08260589208320662,0.05226844497829409,0.0,0.07100201332334527,0.03629320792582182,0.08588728427316189,0.11511871123658969,0.0,0.0,0.03697137806588361,0.1774402989673202,0.06771291762788759,0.14281286006250643,0.06868200354694998,0.20839746033772028,0.13962472297554354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833675389673657,0.08878632762871169,0.0734473541022941,0.0,0.03676990035390312,0.0,0.0,0.03669869358792869,0.0,0.2996074428167537,0.0,0.17223333806855598,0.08376013689708764,0.07720387436940863,0.0,0.028016918719450952,0.0,0.03773290539686038,0.03438848154758041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0342858268312425,0.0,0.3337969392446829,0.1613274181538375,0.0,0.06805764515836889,0.153184910828323,0.035088783366757706,0.0,0.03881186057573858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030879876149236055,0.0,0.0,0.14401709388532488,0.5654418482607144,0.03478285925058631,0.03663729475635765,0.0,0.029321378009739663,0.0,0.0,0.03128880879069891,0.20018056984262356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153840050875922,0.15635976543683675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03184072035114637,0.03545790044706994,0.03017012090363273,0.03115209496477788,0.034400378616232644,0.0,0.0,0.15362146123712514,0.06561566476704375,0.0,

42441,0783110871,A3D8AYKFFAOIMO,3,6,1105142400,Flight Attendant Kicks A**!!!,"Yes, the plot is stupid.  Yes the cast is less than stellar (other than Liotta), yes you've seen others like this before...OR HAVE YOU?Turbulence is a great ride from start to finish because it IS so predictable; you don't have to pay that close of attention and think too hard to get the plot but it is suspensful and a kick to watch Lauren Holly's character grow in her own self-confidence by the end of the film.  At the beginning of the film she's the weak little blonde who lets men walk all over her.  By the end she's a flight attendant who kicks butt.Liotta, as always, does a great job portraying his character.  As Ryan Weaver, a serial killer, he did his homework on the nuances that make ""serials"" serials.  He uses his good looks and natural charm to get women to trust him, uses his brain to take advantage of a great situation in his favor, is  emotionally manipulative, and then masterfully becomes a complete psycho all in the blink of an eye.  Probably one of the best portrayals of a serial killer I've seen on the big screen for a long time.Without spoiling the ""big"" moments in the film I will say that what happens to Catherine Hicks'(Child's Play, Star Trek IV, tv's 7th Heaven) character is a shame (sad, actually), one of the funniest moments of the film (in a sicko kind of way) is when Liotta ""decorates"" the plane with some of the passengers, and the ending is pretty schlocky and cheesy.But all in all, I was certainly rooting for Lauren Holly's stewardess (sorry, ""she's a flight attendant"") when she outdoes Karen Black (Airport '77) by a mile in finally landing the plane and basically telling the officials on the ground to go to hell!The photography is decent, a few of the special effects very cool, and there are a few real decent laughs along with a little gore.  Oh, and you will never watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the same light again!",0.5,339,0.0,0.0,0.1516344273546108,0.0,0.04110965613561679,0.20365722328175118,0.036533608500563856,0.06881995209528279,0.040760015985757854,0.0,0.05495845479243385,0.0,0.05372419683117259,0.06356871752721674,0.12780615137547294,0.0,0.0,0.05472808015182502,0.0,0.0,0.16912269027752672,0.0,0.06169741843257932,0.04133680392743177,0.10108852540358802,0.041401174963815845,0.12825396144883214,0.0,0.0,0.07248188359991656,0.09015260524445726,0.10885967248269704,0.05844203797461126,0.2189466323678289,0.0,0.0,0.2217518118385932,0.0,0.25495397855700747,0.0743931937424052,0.0,0.0,0.04147295160469514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29646824004552186,0.10234720169219091,0.07286742536685391,0.0,0.045351385403719954,0.05194130835761274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23147672863909405,0.0,0.04081553357506757,0.04571093709199097,0.0,0.10125011215924423,0.09136541527584054,0.5580090764205576,0.0,0.0,0.05564406269952625,0.043403919729997215,0.0,0.023948535264743828,0.04631627288279636,0.2469364781692798,0.05506011683334042,0.0,0.0,0.04516756098087399,0.03306522977275852,0.10496267310054326,0.055546744919670425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044660298895591116,0.09222779562565823,0.0,0.08645176326365991,0.09542215935007464,0.06497232711549941,0.0,0.14257879516049338,
619911,B00005JMJ4,A2XYGJ7FAK0QR7,0,4,1077667200,It's okay--and maybe that's just what they want me to think,"This movie isn't intended to be a feel-good movie.  It is intended to provoke us to think about loneliness.  IT IS A COMMENTARY ON THE SEPARATION THAT EXISTS IN A POST-MODERN WORLD FROM A DIRECTOR WHO IS THOROUGHLY POST-MODERN IN HER WORLD-VIEW.We've seen this before, many times, from Woody Allen.  But Allen's movies, particularly his classics &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and later works such as &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, contain characters that are relatable.  Somehow, we care about them, or are at least interested in the outcome of the plot.  I REVISIT WOODY ALLEN'S BEST MOVIES EVERY FEW YEARS.  I DON'T THINK THAT I'LL EVER GO BACK TO THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS WELL-DIRECTED AND WELL-ACTED.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.While the acting performances are fine in Lost in Translation, and many of the situations are humerous, the characters are not endearing.  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LONELY THAT THEY'RE JUST BLAH.  For instance, it is a thoroughly appropriate reflection of Copolla's post-modern philosophy that the characters not end up together at the end of the movie.  But the characters are so boring that I didn't care one way or the other.",0.0,195,0.1425374907400312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443600914174669,0.27191251686849055,0.036586676435027284,0.08667681222984638,0.04113322376295729,0.0,0.0,0.05712267289789525,0.06758993660262501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11638011939635212,0.0,0.05328742023198217,0.0,0.0,0.03280013159474421,0.08790336081938517,0.0,0.04402012341810128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11574589905070506,0.0,0.046559344208143984,0.0,0.0,0.14736209379706494,0.0,0.13554090689242856,0.10546552758046221,0.0,0.04635769462909143,0.0,0.0,0.11877728840489511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10528558157591932,0.11525438344209785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601424773690721,0.1050740591119068,0.03627382116510107,0.038738430257252696,0.0,0.09644043119058514,0.055227002769803274,0.0,0.0,0.7163410442939757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679487125282943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19428998621916818,0.29665375963269136,0.0,0.057664238678174135,0.0,0.0,0.04556217215868421,0.07639040285389107,0.0,0.10502285749081638,0.0,0.0,0.04969344548312044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059060511422072845,0.114929953479107,0.10022961085001444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045960257068849486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1184078,B001DZOC46,A2CB0DNKYCIQE8,1,1,1228262400,The weakest of the Futurama movie titles,"I'm a huge fan of Futurama and I happen to love Bender's Big Score and Beast With a Billion Backs.  BBS, while perhaps not having that many of the laugh out loud moments, was concise and well put together and I loved it, it's actually my favorite of the movie releases so far.  BwaBB was just plain funny with a few parts that made me want to pee myself.  I think Bender's Game misses on both of those aspects.  It has some funny moments, but really feels like a jumble of episode ideas that never made it previously and it doesn't flow well at all.Aside from problems with cohesion, the funny moments are pretty few and far between.  Fry had a very minimal part in this movie, and his little stupid one-liners are one of my favorite parts of the show/movies.  I almost don't remember what he even did in this one.  Most of the story revolves around Bender, which wouldn't normally be a bad thing, but in this case his part of the ""story"" just felt out of place and wasn't very funny at all.  His foray into Dungeons and Dragons and the inevitable fantasy parallel universe side plot just weren't funny and took up too much of the movie's time.  The plot about the dark matter shortage was kind of funny and it explained a big part of Futurama continuity (even tying in some of the past episodes, as this show commonly does so well) but the fantasy segment had absolutely nothing to do with it, and when that part was done, the original plot thread just continued almost as if nothing had changed.  So basically it was like there was a 30 or so minute interruption in a movie that was only mildly funny to begin with.  Also, another con about Bender's Game is the definite lack of Zapp Brannigan.So it is with regret that I give this only three stars, and the extra star is just because it's Futurama.  Now here's where I become a little hypocrytical: do I recommend getting this?  Yes!  Why?  Because it's Futurama! Give them your money so they will continue making more! I'll let them have a dud as long as what they continue to bring us later will be up to my usual standard for the show.  The preview for Into The Wild Green Yonder definitely looks like it'll be back on track.So while this one might have some lost opportunity, it's still Futurama and this is still one of my favorite TV shows of all time.",1.0,427,0.07653687985652877,0.0,0.09739363420796938,0.04454576539762785,0.0,0.29068328573237784,0.0625740203316765,0.11787341186318247,0.06981292496668942,0.09939096479182341,0.09413172168651784,0.0,0.0,0.08165940320975824,0.0,0.0,0.09085182981142217,0.04686857034778081,0.0,0.08583958211243072,0.0,0.0,0.05283704065740708,0.03540041780107375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12994562787086233,0.037518105987933904,0.062072746769449114,0.03860288639043969,0.0,0.0,0.11250219937999151,0.0,0.03619589801015476,0.1186912454729875,0.0909755977290917,0.08733599604660883,0.27607481765796077,0.0,0.18669158299150318,0.10655103985499173,0.044104550332855645,0.04783395760545996,0.04359423561907779,0.03840360649728435,0.04596238200885002,0.11306821617055124,0.046415214267389586,0.04329545832304221,0.1507292467632151,0.0,0.030612437381659398,0.3596808727507198,0.058432733971319456,0.15600730202821547,0.08627659277739397,0.03883846448234467,0.0,0.07573892520409573,0.0,0.0,0.0421195057835077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15164140242656124,0.2446780502690501,0.11743914265668895,0.08182089451764332,0.0,0.1564888218746384,0.3308353537979544,0.0,0.09289010669717324,0.0,0.037170674717464366,0.07339514281625406,0.16407425316848437,0.07932956858096418,0.12688433067342872,0.04715292317949857,0.0,0.08005012393971625,0.07736207823833843,0.1982170816808514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12109332568364355,0.0,0.07649325007323973,0.03949147234208039,0.043609317518326064,0.0,0.08171856523797656,0.16692491727961317,0.0,0.0,

1392890,B004A8ZX32,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,15,21,1314489600,Mainstream moviegoers will grumble underneath their breath... but this is a rare example of film as art,"It's not often one gets to encounter a well funded, high production film starring big name actors that is completely at odds with the normal expectations of mainstream filmmaking. That's because we're dealing with an artist here. I have seen all of Terence Malick's work over the years and in my opinion, ""Tree of Life"" is his best film since the magnificent ""Days of Heaven"". The latter film has had a permanent place in my own Top 10 for many years.""The Tree of Life"" is an altogether different experience but with all the stylistic hallmarks of this visionary director. Many moviegoers are disappointed by this film and that's mostly because of their pre-programmed Hollywood type expectations of what a movie should be like. A film requires a linear plot, a story that goes somewhere. A story with protagonists and antagonists all steadily building towards a resolution at the end. ""Tree of Life"" doesn't have any of this and the audience member who is unfamiliar with this director will be squirming in their seat and asking, ""When will something happen already?""The fact is that a lot happens in this film. A lot more than in most films that you'll see. The history of the universe, galaxies, clusters, exploding stars... the evolution of plant and animal life on Earth... all of this is juxtaposed with a peak into the life of a suburban family in Middle America circa the 1950s and the adult son of that family in our present day. As usual Malick picked some big movie stars to work with and although I am not much of a fan of Brad Pitt, let alone Sean Pean ( with all his annoying politics ), both actors are completely subsumed into the rhythm of the film and their personas fade away. Pitt really does seem like a 50s era American patriarch, ruling the house and raising up his three boys to be men. Sean Penn, who plays one of Pitt's sons as an adult, wanders through the film like a ghost amidst the glass and steel structures of a modern metropolis.There are many awe-inspiring sequences in the film. Some of my favorites are the creation-evolution sequence that goes on for like 15 minutes with the total absence of humanity. We even see dinosaurs and the C.G.I. work is pretty good, not Jurassic Park, but still effective. The shot of the dying sea creature on the beach is stunning. The use of classical composers by Malick is just as daring as in his last picture ""The New World"". In that movie, there was the sublime use of Wagner and Mozart that stood out. In ""Tree of Life"", we get a whole roll call of composers ranging from Bach, Brahms, Couperin, Mahler, Gorecki, Tavener, Berlioz, Smetana and many more. The Couperin piece was one of the most effective as the young children run around in the field and play. The emotions of childhood innocence and deep nostalgia are invoked. I was very moved throughout the film and the conclusion on the beach was quite extraordinary.There is the use of narration in the film as well, just like in all of Malick's work. This time our narrators ask questions about life, long for God, contemplate existence. Basically the kinds of things mainstream movies brush off as unexciting fluff and just focus on the next car chase, shoot out or explosion. If you have any appreciation of serious artistic work in the field of the movies, make sure not to miss this beautiful film. There aren't that many comparisons out there. Beyond Malick's own films, there is probably ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as a close relative but even that would be a faulty comparison because Malick's film is so humanistic and loving while ""2001"" is much colder and abstract.A week after seeing ""Tree of Life"", I went 180 degrees the other way and saw ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" in IMAX 3D. ( Hey, give me a break... I had a free pass. ) Transformers 3 is a fun, dumb summer spectacle full of razzle and dazzle. What a contrast to a spiritual, profound work like The Tree of Life. Sometimes a study in contrasts is a fun exercise for the moviegoer. I just wonder if people who love the Transformers films could appreciate the wonder of Tree of Life as well. Most unfortunately cannot. Oh well... I expect the Blu-ray will be a great memento to this sublime film.",0.7142857142857143,744,0.02120203645878709,0.026694491523564026,0.10791886929291884,0.0,0.058515835547046244,0.23620457299267666,0.08667041711995785,0.14693836111928163,0.03867876984828652,0.09177670787122318,0.07822833379935748,0.0,0.025490493492974182,0.04524212764621609,0.04042674824575204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0475580910266113,0.28085246157393723,0.0,0.05854708812236487,0.01961305321778509,0.023981711696054352,0.01964359531205298,0.020284198198645347,0.04799624172368602,0.02078632555996358,0.051585665991477764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310680158095818,0.0,0.04010755341521162,0.22358075748979947,0.05040362093484565,0.18145183496659728,0.011765767462108365,0.0,0.08274686413252064,0.11806590683926368,0.02443544304153781,0.13250831690815607,0.024152711077881715,0.04255384680591364,0.07639423772521696,0.046982770516746264,0.05143126121599601,0.04797435628866883,0.0626319035594955,0.0,0.0678413872815239,0.46888380466018653,0.0809343781957713,0.0518600577129288,0.0,0.021517849734705028,0.024644567267649832,0.0629429677511059,0.027259466329847253,0.0,0.02333565985240114,0.046139409660866715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019365726327691683,0.043376892098089516,0.04533159940424895,0.024020045690665282,0.17340041626981473,0.5193335778598392,0.07328910543313706,0.0,0.0,0.12356301987246512,0.0,0.10226564872165855,0.02197565942675385,0.07029829828521164,0.0,0.0,0.022175265695202128,0.02143063065036711,0.06275377383601184,0.0,0.026355236996473713,0.0769297307710967,0.08945317554528391,0.0,0.0423799005118603,0.02187963862591524,0.0,0.061528088987171436,0.06791235817751547,0.13872324774709824,0.02304254392722754,0.03382464573361338,

33309,078062369X,A24HM3XDFVHXIK,42,47,1258416000,disappointing Blu-Ray transfer,"I'm giving this Two Stars not because of the film itself but for the following three complaints I have with this disc (I'm a huge fan of the movies, I have all three and have watched them dozens of times):1. Price: $25.49 is awfully expensive for a movie that's been out for 11 years.  Especially considering that much newer movies (e.g. ""Watchmen: The Director's Cut"", loaded with extras, btw) are going for lower.  The aforementioned ""Watchmen"" is nearly $10 cheaper.Surely a $35 or $40 boxed set of all three Blade films could have been issued.2. Quality of TransferThe transfer is hardly stunning and hardly worth the aforementioned price.  Both my Blu-Ray player (a 120GB PS3, the very latest version of Sony's flagship console) and my HD-DVD player (a Toshiba A-30) upscale/up-res standard DVDs and I cannot tell the difference between THIS Blu-Ray transfer and the upscaled SD-DVD.  Thus I'm feeling more than a little taken advantage of.  Unfortunately, Amazon's policy limits me to a 50% refund, if they give me one at all.  This film is still part of the best Vampire franchise out there (so far), in my opinion, but stick to the standard DVD versions.  Not only do you get the extras, but since there's no discernible difference in picture quality, you'll also save yourself a good bit of cash.3. No extrasUnfortunately, I missed the notice, which is just a single line of print, that no extras were included which scotches my reason for returning the disc.  Surely this notification should have been bolded or rendered in a different color, something that would catch the eye better.Although, in general, I am not a big fan of extras (with certain exceptions, they are rarely worth watching), I think a Blu-Ray release should at least contain everything on the original DVD release.  After all, there's more than enough room on a BR disc to accommodate everything on a Standard DVD release since all BR videos are 50GB discs.  And ""Blade"" will fit on a 4.7GB DVD (i.e. a single layer disc) WITHOUT the extras.  Therefore, there's no reason NOT to include the extras given the huge amount of space the BR gives the studio for extra content.Thus, if Blade requires 4.7GB of space for its 2 hours in Standard Definition, multiplying it by 6 (since we are constantly reminded that ""Blu-Ray has SIX TIMES--!!!--the definition of DVD!""), that still leaves 26GB for extras, more than enough if these are left in standard def (as the majority of extras are).Finally, as for the difference in aspect ratios: this is not an issue for me.  Both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD normally use a 2.40:1 ratio (resulting in slightly smaller black bars bordering the film) and, strictly, speaking, I suppose, the original aspect ratio should have been preserved.  However, the increase (?) in aspect ratio does NOT result in a distorted picture so I don't feel this is a drawback.",0.8936170212765957,486,0.0,0.04526172548181399,0.15248446269436278,0.041845879295120965,0.03307208758195731,0.1456347655559825,0.17634436484163896,0.055364595499727116,0.06558161489242234,0.0,0.04421323360789876,0.16910755069388927,0.043220292016295535,0.07671008679557059,0.03427269591568037,0.0,0.04267268358837198,0.04402790074435588,0.3380917576644426,0.0,0.10204245700516885,0.0,0.24817313227476798,0.0,0.040662083801546,0.03330661000623115,0.0,0.0,0.03524416115737551,0.17493168962156608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10200627370017783,0.2229949126304471,0.0,0.14357459464688652,0.019949394296674278,0.045969675673959834,0.035075268670514394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228560631114088,0.10822797639491871,0.0,0.02655380867156169,0.0872040444856198,0.040671352413431505,0.14159365789309986,0.1633190927288786,0.1725422403006573,0.2981301877017979,0.10978233781916152,0.029310362821503247,0.04052371594842313,0.07296898738763548,0.0,0.07114844461066461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06567094098991792,0.0,0.0,0.12218124250298909,0.14700414938993325,0.4661754992201256,0.0,0.04363005279922537,0.0,0.13967114976347889,0.06894671715082225,0.1348636041093761,0.0,0.07946264309536756,0.0,0.04540578438881724,0.03759917237968507,0.03633660976620694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04347928675943744,0.0,0.04222555401383403,0.0,0.0,0.08193237766711063,0.0,0.03838283152836942,0.0784038603611323,0.039069682099626205,0.05735122650165461,

Angel turning evil is just the best twist of all. You totally see a whole different Angel and from it a whole different Buffy. It also revealed to fate of the relationships between Buffy and Angel- that a vampire and a human just don't work. instead of the soul saving Angel from his evil self ( which is what it seemed at first, the whole tortured by guilt was rather empty before) it revealed the true nature and torment of Angel's curse, . The point that it was Angel's demon who committed all the crimes, yet Angel had to take on the guilt and punishment of it. Buffy learned the lesson from this, she did not realize Angel's soul was for tormenting purposes and gave him happiness, which really freed Angel from his torment at the expense for the ending of their relationship, and the danger of the ending of the world. Becoming was a fabulous season finale, it marked the fate of Angel- the point that his place belong in hell so he couldn't recieve happiness again (and again shows the cruety of it because Angel again had to take on the guilt he did not really commit). It also marked the fate of Buffy, the realization of the cruety of her duty. Becoming was truly heartbreaking and the season is fabulous",0.0,235,0.0,0.0,0.13799924082160017,0.12623580291835415,0.0,0.2745838101693511,0.0,0.0,0.09891951073892824,0.0,0.06668868163514266,0.0,0.0651909860295245,0.0,0.05169495013571087,0.0,0.0,0.06640913627451714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06168437277382914,0.07486599670787891,0.2006386072783347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274859741498946,0.0,0.0,0.1093946038408998,0.06604723575765388,0.0709157941087952,0.15940690817684622,0.0,0.0,0.06727052296854202,0.0,0.0928112595513257,0.2708146016138588,0.0,0.15871651323081287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08675090836731698,0.3897246716481461,0.0827946609934881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11936015878601329,0.058999909347402686,0.0,0.07022066905109772,0.0,0.049527122526212046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11086627371175581,0.5989814453844746,0.06247805088231375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05812012910226001,0.0,0.08989263747823706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006130439653397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05419250715885152,0.0,0.12358205460177128,0.05245193063434396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04325263471421955,

Review of Bunuel's masterpiece follows.","The Arrow Films edition of ""Exterminating Angel"" is advertised as an ""all region"" DVD under ""Product Details"" and I bought it as such, expecting that it could be played in the USA since that is what it states.  However, when inserted the DVD gives an error message stating ""This DVD cannot be played.  Playback prohibit[ed] by area limitations."" What is the deceit?  The advertisement simply contradicts its first claim later on, stating under ""Product Description"":""United Kingdom released, PAL/Region 0 DVD: it WILL NOT play on standard US DVD player. You need multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player to view it in USA/Canada.""So, this DVD plays in all regions provided you have an all-region DVD player.  you may wish to buy the pricier Criterion Collection instead.  Now to the film itself.Oft described as a ""surrealist"" masterpiece, ""Exterminating Angel"" follows a party attended by upper class bourgeois whose members for seemingly mysterious reasons all find themselves unable to depart.  At first they rationalize their impotence as a variety of choices, but quickly their behavior degenerates over the course of several days' captivity into the expression of the basest and most primitive of instincts.  Even more miraculously, the police, the military, and the social leaders not trapped with them are pathetically unable to intervene on their behalf as though all were trapped in a bizarre fugue state, somehow frozen in amber, paralyzed in a dream.The natural association is to Bu&ntilde;uel's later classic, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,"" which also examines the ruling class's relation to convention, but there is a profound and crucial but little noticed difference that reflects Bu&ntilde;uel's greater understanding of his subject as he matured.  Replay the moment in ""Exterming Angel"" that releases the party from captivity: the magic words that undo the entire spell are nothing more than a social banality - one which the host had inadvertently failed to utter the night before - and the utterance of which liberates all of them to do as they wish.  In ""Exterminating Angel"" the upper class is still the slave of convention.  By contrast, in ""Discreet Charm"" the ruling elite are revealed as open predators - murderers, drug dealers, seducers of their best friends' wives - disguised only by the mask of convention that from time-to-time they find it prudent to assume.  The rulers are here the masters of convention and use it as a tool to deceive others in order to advance their own selfish ends. Would that this change reflected Bu&ntilde;uel's growing cynicism, but alas it reflects his utter realism, a realism that Plato so fruitfully explored in The Republic.",0.5,431,0.0,0.0,0.18271385185596453,0.04178470413319235,0.09907121690045846,0.10906639481775234,0.11739104279136262,0.24877645699414558,0.03274287003901404,0.06215363787882497,0.0,0.0,0.04315710757837151,0.10213059078621223,0.13689036844787222,0.0,0.042610299707989484,0.0,0.3375974959027053,0.04025951186906524,0.03396442650035016,0.081671386608537,0.02478103239933081,0.06641241746799272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040630421062612325,0.0,0.029112659029921193,0.0362101800724173,0.0,0.0,0.07035268221292691,0.0,0.0,0.24493580407121213,0.04266834793967705,0.12288402912410863,0.1593618396581517,0.04590247186798106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204650412054758,0.043113515198435294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05742999934429825,0.25800176687996684,0.08221638394438076,0.029267513532110948,0.040464473678291576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557493558826942,0.0,0.0,0.04066754126181054,0.19571898888902575,0.5344560623432386,0.20680558213936337,0.08713253865088476,0.0,0.03486674056751287,0.10326888425921694,0.05771419064744061,0.0744125176115146,0.2578760449956112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04216382379934615,0.07175200142967626,0.03704368917827263,0.12271889911565417,0.0,0.03832671905150003,0.026096413500162063,0.03901256550489324,0.08590107573603123,

1275607,B002KYIAJC,A50EGYZY7RHGI,3,3,1322956800,The most remarkable anime I have ever seen,"I spent a quarter century in Tokyo.  I raised two sons there.  I have seen countless different anime, some old, some new, some popular, some obscure.  I boughtSpice and Wolf: Season One [Blu-ray] because many of the reviews intrigued me.Wow...I can honestly say I have never seen anything like this.  The story is involved, well-researched, and beautifully illustrated.  The economics, the cultural references, the oddly parallel historicity are so well done this anime could be used to illustrate practical lessons in storytelling, in business, in economics, in symbology, in politics, and of course, in graphic arts.The characters are extremely well done.  The goddess Holo is purely a goddess, with all the quirkiness, wisdom, and manipulative qualities one would expect a genuine goddess to have. There are shades here of Ishtar, Diana, and even Persephone.  Lawrence the peddler is profit-driven, self-centered, but never arrogant nor overly demanding.  The relationship between the two of them is mature, adult, flirtatious without being overly erotic, and sometimes, profound.Many anime and graphic novel advocates are overly prone to labeling common cartoons as high art.  Slapstick comedy, gratuitious violence, and childish personal relations between characters do not constitute high art, regardless of how popular a particular anime, manga, or graphic novel might be.  Sometimes, like in Neil Gaimon's ""Sandman"" series, the genre does reach these heights.  ""Spice and Wolf"", while doing it much differently than ""Sandman"", is as fine as anything Shakespeare, Hemmingway, or Soseki ever produced.

The movie was visually fantastic. For sure you see they wanted you to know that this was set in the Alien universe, but don't go in expecting Alien. I think Ridley Scott and Co. were better off not mentioning Alien at all. This would've quelled the criticism the movie got because now people have an expectation that may not have been intended. If people weren't given hints of the connection, it would've given a surprise that was unexpected but also more open minds looking at this as it's own thing. This brought the quality down for me because my head was filled with too much information beforehand. Now you have no choice but to look for something else you weren't meant to be looking for. That made this kind of predictable. I knew mostly everyone was going to die. And a lot if it felt forced. I did not have a problem understanding the story. I wasn't confused like dome said they were. Questions were left unanswered on purpose. The problem for me is I don't want to return for them. The movie was OK for a look but in the end, it just wasn't what it could've or should've been.",0.35714285714285715,226,0.0,0.0,0.05138489402770222,0.07050705478714005,0.055723897558009654,0.09201872353025081,0.0,0.04664252052916293,0.11049992477486964,0.05243868590254356,0.14899172567618657,0.1424665408223757,0.0,0.17233404685726308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14836718273032,0.0,0.0,0.05731120345953788,0.0,0.292706709719525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19649753543105045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11458176288099511,0.11271872968329504,0.0,0.034558862122928136,0.23529225391779754,0.0,0.05909910202589438,0.056216342433623,0.0,0.0,0.1380019461675471,0.060785243292103976,0.0,0.13422331237986396,0.0,0.06852806826346809,0.059643577592025696,0.06879499494806685,0.14536013336195758,0.06697682649465202,0.04624367702185216,0.0,0.0,0.12294707335978979,0.0,0.0,0.15575309094193712,0.0,0.0,0.06590697321399591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06475307182392125,0.0,0.20640880674443202,0.34909755106220713,0.0,0.07351324849420644,0.0,0.0,0.11616986057963584,0.194772593770363,0.0,0.16736047326018555,0.07463366513773616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40337752363090684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21344033155144126,0.06053677297514259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044034803992836435,0.13165875649962377,0.19326471983267954,

There is an atypical plot element that cannot be discussed in much depth without becoming a ""spoiler"". Suffice it to say that there is a bit of Peter Weir influence (think ""The Last Wave"", with its cryptic elements of Aboriginal mysticism). The film is boosted by uniformly good performances, with the compelling Frances O'Connor emerging as someone to watch for in the future. The film's ending feels a bit forced and ""tacked on"", and some repetitive film school tricks are somewhat distracting, but certainly not unexpected with a fledgling director.

At least that is what the characters in this story perceive their situation to be.  Synchronicity pulls these two men together.  Each is the other's shadow side, complete with revulsion and attraction.  Opposites attract and without any regard for the moral rules of society, the evil side of human nature is brought to the surface and acted out.  This is not a new idea, but the characters discover the power of love and that death is not the answer.  Facing life is the hardest thing to do.

Wait until you hear this...This is the story about how the best intentions can go so so wrong. How the purest love can turn into the darkest of horrors and how love can live on and still shine brightly for everyone else to see, even if everything appears to be blood red for a while.When they received their first big cat from a Hollywood celebrity, they had no clue what to do with it so they treated it like a child. Instead of getting an education (which they eventually did), they added the animal to their act, got more famous and then just kept adding more animals, poorly trained (at first), to their act. Money was made, they lived very large and the price they paid was so dear, so tragic, so unbelievable, it made me feel so sad.They made tons of mistakes, assigning the animals human emotions, treating the cats like children (including holding grudges against them), and basically doing all the same things that we all do with our pets. Except their pets happened to be 300-pound tigers.In the end, I really loved Ron Holiday and I wanted to give him a hug and tell him time heals. He suffered a lot and had an unconquerable spirit. I hope he does make it to the Tiger Temple in Thailand. From this documentary, I took his spirit and attitude. He made me see that the human heart can endure massive pain and still come through like a champion, inspiring others. I think that is truly what this documentary is about. Sorry if that sounds hopelessly lame.

155635,079284615X,A2TGFURT008O0A,227,236,963878400,One of the All-Time Greats,"This is a sweeping statement, but true nonetheless:  I believe that Kenneth Branagh's HENRY V is the greatest screen adaption ever done of Shakespeare.  Period.  Better than Olivier (although he was great in a very  diferent way).  Better than any version of Hamlet (even Branagh's, which is  the best of the Hamlets).  Better than anything else.Why do I say this?  Simply because no other film adaptation of Shakespeare has captured the  essence of what the Bard was trying to say while adding a modern  perspective in the process, all in a manner that is readily accessible to a  mass audience.  Yet that is precisely what this film does.By sheer  genius, Branagh was able to present HENRY V in all of its nationalistic  glory, just as Shakespeare wrote it, while at the same time adding an  anti-war footnote that serves both as counterpoint and commentary on the  Bard's message.  The contrast betwen the St. Crispin's Day speech as  presented here (in which we are made to feel the real power behind  Shakespeare's words) and the gritty, realistic presentation of the battle  itself which follows is proof of my assertion.It's all here:  Lessons  on history, loyalty, and the qualities of leadership, all wrapped in a  fiercely entertaining package.  Branagh's great accomplishment is to bring  the piece to life without the slightest bit of stuffiness or anachronism,  and even to add his own touch to an unapproachable masterpiece.  This, his  first film, remains his crowning achievement.  I think the Bard would  approve.",0.961864406779661,249,0.0,0.0,0.2072307739668722,0.0,0.11236479745556673,0.12370114899485907,0.04992855578680259,0.1410788979706744,0.05570456397660436,0.0,0.0751088214025765,0.0,0.07342202614737506,0.04343800666862885,0.05822197533309956,0.0,0.0724917566272532,0.0,0.0,0.13698484903156263,0.17334829536901555,0.06947266649155097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168519496046608,0.0,0.05987228686616634,0.0,0.061603405261815354,0.0,0.0,0.17953368852147714,0.0,0.0,0.22729237877029454,0.0,0.24390250853205606,0.06777950269852236,0.07809264055983862,0.05958537467728671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06013433023665117,0.06936104626609298,0.0,0.3376395888071929,0.09324834819301285,0.0,0.0,0.06197934639014563,0.07098544650831733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20755978183560028,0.16648572536577413,0.49862410527470674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13091679996072839,0.06329800721518596,0.269980048116652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061728123247189466,0.135565516553379,0.0,0.07591280649033763,0.0738620027860296,0.0,0.0,0.12206974982114806,0.0,0.20877836178627976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637102821070331,0.0,

1284892,B002R0ELCY,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,0,1,1276128000,Worth it for the Spectre Short Alone!,"Justice League: Crisis on Two-Earths is the latest original DC animated film and takes on a legacy that is forty years in the making.  The idea of parallel Earths has been a staple in DC continuity since the advent of the Silver Age of comics when it was decided that the Golden Age and Silver Age Superheroes came from different Earths.  Longtime DC writer Gardner Fox penned the first ""Crisis"" story involving the parallel worlds way back Justice League of America #29-30, in 1964.  Since then, Crisis has become a regular plotline in DC comics...some may say its even an obsession.In this story, the Crime Syndicate is an evil version of the Justice League.  They control their Earth in an organized crime manner with each of the core members controlling a territory with a ""family"" of under-villains to help enforce their rule.  Here, Lex Luthor is one of the last superheroes alive and he uses a dimensional transporter to travel to the Earth of the JLA and enlist their aid to save his world.While most of the League is in favor, Batman refuses, believing they have more important tasks on their own world.  Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, and J'onn J'onzz travel with Luthor back to his world to confront the villains.  Here they will not only fight their own evil counterparts, but also evil versions of heroes such as The Marvel Family, Green Arrow, The Elongated Man, and Vibe.  But a more serious threat is soon uncovered...Owlman, the parallel to Batman is hatching a plot that could destroy the entire universe.One of the strengths of DCs animated films over those of Marvel's is their use of well-known actors to voice the characters.  This works both for and against DC in this film, however.  The familiar voices of Kevin Conroy and Rino Romano as Batman, and Tim Daly and George Newbern as Superman, have been replaced by William Baldwin (Batman) and Mark Harmon (Superman).  Baldwin is passable as Batman but Harmon just doesn't sound right.  His voice doesn't have the power and authoritative tone you expect from Superman.  On the other hand, James Woods is brilliant as Owlman.  He single-handedly raises the bar for the other actors with his voice that oozes sinister evil.  Chris Noth is fine as Lex Luthor but you definitely miss Clancy Brown's deep resonations.  Another notable actors include Bruce Davison as the alternate Earth President and Kari Wuhrer as Black Canary.Justice League: Crisis on Two-Earths is a solid story although not quite on a par with Green Lantern: First Flight or Superman/Batman Public Enemies.  It plays like an extended episode of the Justice League TV show with nothing truly making it momentous.The DVD also comes with a short animated feature starring The Spectre and I'm tempted to say this is worth the price of the DVD alone.  The Spectre is the most important DC character yet to appear in animation.  The story is written by Steve Niles is largely influenced by the 1970s incarnation of the Specter in Adventure Comics, written by Michael Fleisher with art by Jim Aparo.  This was a Spectre that dealt with criminal in the most gruesome fashion and Niles has brought that style to this short.  It's even set in the 1970s with Jim Corrigan as the Spectre, trying to track down the murderers of a top Hollywood film producer.  The animation is done in a misty, grainy style with traces of Anime influence.  Just a fantastic addition to the DVD!",0.0,582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530107305578041,0.10321889962285326,0.21306099814725735,0.0,0.19439373725071013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659736675878221,0.0,0.07980476718109202,0.13370753927910267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892441145951048,0.06291750486904867,0.07961933232052783,0.06381796035327703,0.0387277603294287,0.05189461329036156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249850097411449,0.06824582991305958,0.05658921520024733,0.0,0.0,0.10994706642441057,0.0,0.0,0.22619131828327768,0.0,0.27206088369071196,0.06226261110195319,0.03586815715312005,0.054735441589142134,0.026032767183861605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056297084382753784,0.10106660549840163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044875758493122565,0.32566539517459664,0.12848764172699484,0.04573922632620069,0.03161890943881076,0.02846727835852809,0.06520760810985142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037049336451126104,0.0,0.02869297064781922,0.11994388608418553,0.0,0.11470100354581565,0.5927560305788395,0.19391727247241383,0.0,0.034928040406387965,0.0,0.08069422884872354,0.09019565072928089,0.0,0.2015041485027212,0.0,0.07085635416137327,0.0,0.0,0.04151040112889689,0.0,0.034866953577314765,0.0,0.029585768091348545,0.0,0.0,0.028945910991439058,0.0,0.0,0.02994846957384884,0.22430889769369725,0.0,0.0447486908473186,
1346484,B003IHUI0O,A3HWLS0TSRHCKH,1,1,1285113600,Great movie but could have been better?,"A few of my friends, die hard Princeo of Persia game fans, advised me not to pick up this movie. With Netflix and my pretty large movie collection I didn't see any reason to own this one, but for reasons I dont even understand (probably cus people kept telling me not to watch it) I picked this up on Blu ray. And all I can say is Im happy that I went against my better judgement and picked this baby up!First and foremost Im not into the games, being a gamer myself I couldnt get into the games. From my perspective PoP looks like it has alot of high flying parkour and the main hero fighting a billion badguys by himself, and a dagger that shifts time. And guess what? This movie has all of that! The storyline is solid and I feel that the characters were surprisingly fleshed out, from the main character to the villain to all the supporting guys. With recent big budget action/fantasy movies it seemed like the pacing was out of whack (i.e. Clash of the Titans) but this movie got it right for the most part.  Overall the movie greatly exceeded my expectations.That being said there are a few things I think could have been improved. First being our hero, I know Jake whatchamacallit looks the part but his acting is something else all together.  No matter what he's in you just cant get attached to the character.  Now we all know theres going to be a sequel since Disney is trying to capture more of the younger male audience and it cant ride the Pirates craze forever so hopefully Jake can get it together next time.  Dont get me wrong he didnt drag my movie experience down but looking at how he's a box office letdown the movie could have probably faired alot better without him.  Secondly I know no one else cared but Im tired of all foreign oriented movies made in the U.S. where everyone has British accents.  Last time I checked i dont think Persians had any contact with Britain during their hey day...>_> Also my final gripe is how the characters kept having to explain key plot points over and over again. I know dastan and tus werent in the same room together when they found out about whatever but WE were so they could have spared us that.Over all this is a good movie and if youre into action/fantasy with some good acting and killer fight scenes (personal favorite was the knife fight at the end that didnt even have dastan..killer stuff) its definitely worth picking up. Usually the newer movies dont get alot of play time on my blu ray player but this one has, and if that says anything its give this one a go and help disney put something other than Pirates out for their live action stuff (Tron aside...)",1.0,485,0.03639380325673188,0.0,0.21611954375695355,0.04236362456480545,0.0,0.27644373093848085,0.02975436925574535,0.0,0.06639303459397418,0.031507383324317996,0.0,0.04279996566773673,0.0,0.1812047892932408,0.03469674068397246,0.07374313249043478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08163460200875691,0.0,0.08280293068349662,0.07537310898843437,0.06733255095182654,0.20582591179918142,0.06743740342408737,0.0,0.04119334908582416,0.14272090217940672,0.11806404116640078,0.11013559907870689,0.0,0.047597432865905856,0.035663703719131724,0.0884877908157962,0.06884557579831556,0.06772618655170175,0.1297785333471645,0.12458656780793226,0.12117732945496283,0.09307688663359343,0.03550924340692741,0.06755431871191757,0.0,0.0,0.12437612067978703,0.036522348489540474,0.04371084609606415,0.21505880154060944,0.13242448707077806,0.0,0.2866910990894232,0.08266989301187366,0.08733852427997306,0.1810913125399164,0.05557031924717926,0.11869204111317798,0.0,0.0,0.04230298982032088,0.14405748172233923,0.04679152667341097,0.0,0.0,0.03959970073731774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06648346589382699,0.03722873696531385,0.0,0.04123098357947981,0.1984306443589638,0.40202580388329723,0.08386833623836581,0.0,0.0,0.03534981371394331,0.06979977215328396,0.17554143474532125,0.15088698242149481,0.18100306841148162,0.0,0.0,0.15225749817866518,0.0,0.05385917770315721,0.04274280945249977,0.0,0.08803448328242373,0.0,0.08549599374730059,0.07274611400025624,0.0375569236015503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10583190063854812,0.0,0.029030407160430934,

If this were a novel I'd describe it as having a distinctively funny,  charming, idiosyncratic voice, and recommend it to friends who need a kick  in the pants to cheer up a little.The dance contest plot of the movie  drags a lot of disparate stuff along in its wake. You have your extremely  winning ungainly-girl-whose-spirit-makes-her-lovely story, and your  immigrants-in-a-new-country side, and your redemption-after-many-years  moments... None of that is new material, but it all comes together with  total assurance in ways you wouldn't have been especially prepared for. All  the elements are snappily handled, lively and enjoyable, and in some cases  they're really pretty poignant too. Several of the minor characterizations  are surprising and memorable. That's always a good sign, isn't it?Along  the way, too, you get a bunch of infectiously funny situations and some  wryly delightful direction. (The choreography doesn't stop on the dance  floor, but it's great there too.)I wouldn't describe Strictly Ballroom  as displaying any &quot;new steps,&quot; cinematically; I'd just say it  dances the familiar ones extremely well in new, lively combinations.

893232,B0007XBKPE,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,20,20,1118361600,Light-Hearted British Comedy,"The selling point for ""The Naked Truth"" is that it features a young Peter Sellers.  Truth be told this is more of an ensemble effort and not what you would call a break-out role for Sellers.  Sellers as a ""Scottish"" television personality is given the opportunity to employ a number of disguises and voice characterizations that are amusing but not fitfully so.  The film's central premise of a group of prominent Brits who conspire to dispatch a blackmailing tabloid publisher(Dennis Price of ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"") is played more for broad slapstick than for the macabre dark comedy of classic Ealing comedies.  These observations aside this is a highly enjoyable film with a good laugh quotient.  Solid cast also includes the irrepressible Terry-Thomas and Shirley Eaton(""Goldfinger"").",1.0,126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14238574630792628,0.11253184188358396,0.2477700926753641,0.10000556175074239,0.09419241968449014,0.0,0.10589750841503642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08700516547640588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23147466593314808,0.0,0.33777583119529375,0.0,0.0,0.11332983325020504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34895014334248897,0.0678802654686777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24550599246513105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19569872485003242,0.40576983911332987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210456627412631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11172672316965133,0.0,0.0,0.13857889706754006,0.16673322737170937,0.35249320434901965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311114242777965,0.0,0.13519070373619194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225122188356284,0.0,0.0,0.11832470845839203,0.0,0.08892625637210498,0.1329393942121637,0.0975722977347632,

1163722,B0019LY5IC,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,0,1,1262131200,Oliver Stone's Best Film In Years,"Oliver Stone has never shied away from controversy as any student of films from the last two decades can tell you. Stone has also never shied away from using past Presidents of the United States (JFK, Nixon) for his own dramatic purposes either. Yet Stone choose to make a film about a sitting President, something that hadn't been done before (at least not in name i.e. Primary Colors). So how exactly does Oliver Stone's W. hold up? I'll put it this way; W. is his best film since Nixon in 1995. Why do I say that?Well to start of Stone has gotten himself one of his best casts. Josh Brolin plays the title role and it is far from a caricature. Brolin's George W. Bush is a fully formed character that while it might not be a dead-on version of the real man is so close at times it can send shivers up the spine. Brolin has the character and voice of Bush done very well though one could argue on how truthful it is to real-life (more on that later). Surrounding Brolin is a whole smattering of excellent actors. First there's Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney who is not only very close to real but also manages to steal any scene he happens to be speaking in,especially the whole ""empire"" speech during one briefing. James Cromwell turns in a memorable turn as George H.W. Bush as does Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Toby Jones as Karl Rove and especially Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush. There are some miscasts though such as Scott Glenn as Rumsfeld and Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice, both of whom seem more suited to Saturday Night Live then to this film. Stone also fails to make use of some of the cast as well, especially Ioan Gruffudd as Tony Blair but the strength of the rest of the cast makes up for this admirably.W. also has some strong production values as well. While technically a low-budget film by most Hollywood standards (approximately $30 million), Stone makes good use of it. The film takes across the country (and part of the world for that matter) in its locations and it does so without ever feeling cheap in any way. Stone might not have had a lot of money but he certainly spent it well to judge from things like Bush ranch in Crawford or even the White House sets which could arguably compare with those on The West Wing.And now we come to the controversial part of the film: its portrayal of George W. Bush. It seems that everyone was expecting Stone to portray Bush has either a caricature or has some kind of tyrant. Stone has chosen (wisely in my opinion) to do neither. instead he portrays Bush as a relatively simple minded man who allows others to guide him down whatever path he lets them for the most part. While there are those who would argue this is too sympathetic to Bush I would argue that, at least from I have gathered in reading books like Jacob Weisberg's excellent The Bush Tragedy, that this is a fairly accurate view of the forty-third President of the United States. Even if it isn't do we really expect it to be? To say that we expect the George W. Bush of this film to be true to life is like saying we expect Shakespeare's Henry V to be true to the real life Henry V. You don't watch Shakespeare to see true to life history any more then you should see this film and expect a true to life portrayal of George W. Bush.However one feels about the way the film portrays its title character, one should admire the film on its other grounds as well. That includes an excellent leading man in the form of Josh Brolin, a good supporting cast and strong production values. Overall the result is Stone's best film in years and one he should be proud of.",0.0,665,0.05123646781038152,0.0,0.0,0.11928198166231752,0.023568056227614913,0.12972904775111022,0.04188924064451023,0.29590721250733487,0.0701028253864579,0.13307158529966193,0.0,0.03012764354072826,0.09239981630035078,0.054665664341356654,0.024423641912867066,0.051909079238427344,0.09122909496127275,0.03137546239726716,0.0,0.05746402249483636,0.2666333650873223,0.029143214729731987,0.07074193089432894,0.1421896767053055,0.0,0.04747036638874552,0.0,0.02899671806143582,0.20092747270185787,0.041553670566615714,0.12921062039889655,0.0,0.03350466451235323,0.07531291225792447,0.062288101820008095,0.024230801761733298,0.17480336821661724,0.0,0.16078087956974538,0.15638120510485146,0.1310368930735623,0.0,0.07132899765350535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712615742067601,0.061537656374269355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02522585913595924,0.0,0.0819721507039677,0.33992890273977777,0.09779229630232666,0.12532410190021015,0.02887828636936041,0.05199965660958549,0.029777813559659312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02819627225869704,0.05574984229638105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07019830964413375,0.10482383331517475,0.0,0.0,0.17459849638706537,0.3568172440587692,0.0,0.031091945285816592,0.063801185498079,0.07465005428317316,0.0,0.09610741979416534,0.0,0.33976325851680905,0.031565818141274606,0.03235737922145617,0.08038253465798534,0.051788884506829364,0.01895620804738914,0.03008741028231483,0.09553440217615196,0.12393802145614274,0.16212822615900768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029193604409388813,0.0743438479825594,0.0,0.018624230930630536,0.05568420573616143,0.061305032267652174,

Maybe it was dust and wind blowing up the small town Texas streets.  Two young men graduate from high school and struggle with becoming adults as they learn more about the adults in the community and their lives.  Larry McMurtry never wrote a better novel than this one nor had a book turned into a better film.  (Well, Hud is just as great I think.)  Peter Bogdanavich directed a classic film and Cybill Shepherd make a great debut as an actress.  Let's not forget Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges too.

Michael Wincott and Morgan Freeman both deserve better material than this.,0.3,84,0.2280730891660479,0.0,0.19348290706875346,0.0,0.0,0.11549470890407632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11553356977580778,0.27073036580954324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10789881406568741,0.12972758068019424,0.15744967795546932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147573856020368,0.0,0.06506337353666204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21167507619974907,0.0,0.28508187160400444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526999147030719,0.13831320694169305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06304805790510386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293233657387164,0.4298293225005072,0.0,0.12408192149497967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083196600518241,0.0,0.0,0.1291933921825981,0.07772045993122986,0.21907997900992854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24446333481907914,0.0,0.06301733516726896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08438132277663239,0.0,0.0,0.13792386861659775,0.0,0.0,0.11397153814774054,0.0,0.12995188439183872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

I remember that my father almost had a fit because he laughed so hard during the movie. So when I decided to buy a stack of nostalgic comedies from Amazon this was high on the list.Alas, how time changes all! The consensus in my household is that while the movie is funny (with some great moments of comedy), Danny Kaye is not. He comes across as a schmuck who tries very hard to be funny but it just doesn't work. I can't put my finger on it, but the fact that he plays a cowardly klutz who doesn't seem to pay attention to anything anyone ever tells him, sings third rate jokes to fourth rate tunes and falls back on the shtick about his pants falling down, doesn't help.Sorry to all those who love this.

1049811,B000MR9D5E,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,0,0,1245456000,A cinematic study of Earth's different ecologies,"There's not much more I can say - this is a beautiful documentary. Each episode follows a different ecosystem (forests, oceans, etc.). The producers have taken care to find interesting and new wildlife in each, not simply filming the familiar suspects from wildlife documentaries in blu-ray quality. There are some extraordinary memorable moments, such as a bunch of baby ducklings jumping out of a tree and bouncing in leaves.My only complaint with the series is that each episode follows ecosystems rather than continents. This means the same episode (""Grasslands"") covers wildebeest in East Africa, antelope in Central Asia, yak in the Himalayas, and caribou in North America. This means each episode jumps around the world and tends not to spend much time in any particular place. This can also become confusing if you don't pay attention to where the scene is at a particular moment. I personally prefer viewing an episode about a particular region and learning more about it.Despite the geographic jumping around, the footage is incredible and well worth the price.

The last few I bought I returned because I did not or barely broke a sweat. I can honestly say that I broke a decent sweat from this workout. However, that did not happen until the third part of the series where you put all the moves together over and over again. I was happy that I broke a sweat and my heart rate did go up. However, again this is so repetitive that the more you do this workout the more aggravating it is. I have had enough ""Happy Feet"" from Barefoot Cardio. In this workout it feels like you spend half the time doing that, whether it is by itself, or in combination before another move. I don't know if I should keep this or send it back. I bought my copy from Total Fitness DVDs for about 14.95. I'm debating whether the decent sweat for a repetitive 30 minute DVD is worth it.",1.0,184,0.08287913338659463,0.0,0.14061891932636184,0.0,0.0,0.12590834043210491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175135301957475,0.10193197752757913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790144349284276,0.08396713680768648,0.09838029634173479,0.10150469945402063,0.1948645158491356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11443079855376724,0.23000330985868617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09380907649142342,0.0,0.06721642519032794,0.0,0.10095154358937261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839056582537954,0.10282130741484785,0.0,0.18914624372894523,0.2759555515669137,0.0,0.0,0.07692028436640384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495156033050556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16321947499253614,0.0,0.132596587987348,0.045821875960811234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523409591086054,0.09633604686043924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09017988189707285,0.11212224680696607,0.0,0.0,0.07570096478991079,0.0,0.0,0.09389478103287024,0.3953980780759949,0.31844456299667967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22208789963654274,0.08590323917368176,0.0915990947655094,0.0,0.0,0.08668350358741778,0.0,0.24530560554297579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19833170254373939,
795394,B00018D42W,A5TZXWU8AALIC,1,4,1081641600,Run of the Mill Massacre,"First of all: this is NOT a true story.  &quot;Based On&quot; is about as stretched as you can get.  It makes for a nice ad campaign, but too many people have no idea what they're talking about.THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and PSYCHO are both based on the same case: Ed Gein, a mild-mannered maniac in Wisconsin who dug up bodies and made skin suits out of them.  He also did some creative things with body parts and his furniture.  They found an old woman hung upside down and draining into a bucket in his barn (while he was having dinner with a family down the road!).  Not in Texas, no superhot girls like Jessica Beil bouncing around in terror, no conspiracy of backroad inbreds.I always liked the original.  Something about the low-budget look gave it a gruesome authenticity.  The claustrophobic madness of that goofy family in the original also really works.This new version doesn't expand on anything from the original and, although slickly produced, it could have been any of the forgettable &quot;sequels&quot; that have come out over the years.  CHAINSAW basically becomes just another slasher flick.  I did like that they got John LaRoquette to do the lead-in narration--as he did in the original, but that's about it.  R. Lee Ermey's always fun.I thought having Jessica Beil dispatch one of her friends since he'd been relieved of a limb was a weird choice (I would've like that character better if he'd wanted to use his final breaths fighting back against the hillbilly cannibals), even as I kept getting hit over the head with a Meat Is Murder subtext.  At least the movie didn't end with &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot; or some lame anti-meat folk song.I wanted to like it, but it's just another modern studio horror movie: no discernible artist voice/value, corporate product, etc.",0.25,304,0.1912752529091401,0.0,0.040566482567598705,0.11132544935767551,0.04399196615384629,0.12107565899199108,0.03909507934906405,0.14729021295130712,0.04361781178028796,0.0,0.0,0.11247209037000767,0.0,0.1020385403130827,0.0,0.04844655908149365,0.05676252663099504,0.0,0.0,0.0536309678711364,0.0,0.05439851736701281,0.03301159628423877,0.044235039896338334,0.05408805869631185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11634567896562806,0.2411836251750568,0.058246060385172195,0.0,0.14057854644440912,0.0,0.04522904225481837,0.207637006198221,0.05683985451462008,0.08184884902808283,0.15921820656422364,0.0,0.09331313170760616,0.17752293303306466,0.0,0.05977152684941187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07064290994272439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21724446579917092,0.07650431678581991,0.18506508781301811,0.10952304290579758,0.0779763591279298,0.0,0.048531094619932005,0.0,0.09464053212409654,0.061480666332983054,0.5407195079634667,0.052630961284615224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783171091374018,0.051120166909898186,0.0,0.16295215586282447,0.3444995846425629,0.0,0.05803600396490165,0.0,0.0,0.13756774378702272,0.05125526466702944,0.0,0.07927496027164208,0.05892053166702539,0.0,0.05001382252150668,0.0,0.07076704627417672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04779155415346132,0.0,0.0,0.04625656598645492,0.0,0.13905542804700455,0.05196987121871213,0.03814384575648616,

But films like ""Dakota's Summer"" are a welcome oasis for children who live in an increasingly complicated world that offers many more chances for heartbreak than heartwarming moments. It's formulaic, it's predictable, and nothing really bad happens to anyone. Yet those darned horses are as therapeutic for viewers as they are for the troubled kids in the film, and the characters are ones we care about. There's a place for light drama and formulaic, feel-good movies, and as that genre goes, ""Cowgirls `n Angels: Dakota's Summer"" is an entertaining film that will definitely appeal to the target audience, and maybe even the entire family--Familyhometheater.com",1.0,106,0.11784381007248303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21682599605758981,0.29837664299271444,0.3853807984469992,0.27223448328908206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08382063845579488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13216717783793622,0.22300232611039456,0.0,0.4067658752026071,0.0,0.0,0.10918178164602199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1461990989442413,0.0,0.0672356029531152,0.13079148022944376,0.0,0.0,0.10937106858144392,0.0,0.14729985924797756,0.0,0.11826004192090948,0.0,0.0,0.14293098189665177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12970277986776677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335066896901778,0.24094579029129878,0.2829928284341937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446335256629264,0.11300647853027963,0.0,0.0,0.1302425096074184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14252864498084783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399383650121092,0.12582204944011,0.0,0.0,0.0,

Filled with over-the-hill stage-actor refugees (except for Peter Lorre who was also a refugee, but from Germany), dumb dialog (and a not fully formed plot), cheap interior and, especially, sound-stage exterior sets (except for the clever shots in Albert Hall), primative sound, choppy editing, it's pretty much a mess!  A major fight scene with chairs is amateurish play-acting at it's worse and just plain embarrassing.  The shoot-out finale (supposedly in East End London and based on an actual event) is (unintentionally?) hilarious!  These set pieces clearly show Hitchcock was not (yet) an action director.  Two things standout: the unbelievable consumption of cigarettes by all (""begs"" for a product placement!); and Lorre's stunning performance (as the master villain) delivered with phonetically-memorized lines (he spoke very little English at the time).  (Lorre also got married during the production in full makeup--he didn't have time to change.)Highly UNrecommended!WILLILAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D.",0.0,158,0.0,0.0,0.09606886159633755,0.2636390564222805,0.20836206840177096,0.28672933885762514,0.0,0.08720255113895499,0.20658993621509972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08054865154991685,0.1079630941500043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345325209712235,0.2095133546976069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184262657606163,0.22846680155357646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21073819935138016,0.0,0.12922204492334366,0.12568595945800706,0.0,0.11049129438571235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12811962795755283,0.0,0.0,0.18117623603604324,0.06260971824917827,0.08645687592783596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120630580539357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14957873808142366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43511366457925854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23475152374624728,0.06257920911021983,0.0,0.14303365533266527,0.0,0.1144646698039916,0.16758932852427313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954402142876347,0.0,0.2469815441049081,0.0,0.0,

1265195,B002ECJZ76,A3DABNO1HS997Q,2,4,1350604800,Lost in Dubbing!,"I was so disappointed and frustrated while watching this film. I was looking forward to seeing a film with a European flair. I was ready for an off-beat, unconventional, un-Americanized story of Santa. I enjoy foreign films very much, and eagerly anticipated watching some fine Finnish acting and dialogue.There are two problems that I shall note:1. The dubbing. (It IS disclosed in the Amazon description that it is dubbed, but I did not see that. I thought nobody dubbed films anymore!) The dubbing undermines the characters, the story, the entire film. I watched the original Finnish behind-the-scenes stuff on the DVD and the original Finnish trailer and got the sense that it was so much better than it could ever be with the dubbing. There is no option for subtitles of any sort. It's the dubbing or nothing. Not only is the dubbing poorly done, but I'm sure there are elements of the story lost in translation.2. The story. To be fair, I have to take into consideration that much of the quality of the story, acting, etc. was lost due to the dubbing. I found the story meandering, uneven, and confusing. I didn't understand how the ending came about. The connections between the characters felt very odd a lot of the time. I don't really understand WHY Nikolas even sacrificed his life to making toys.

Liam Neeson is over the top in the action scenes, destroying everything he comes into contact with, all of a sudden is supposed to be French without speaking it, (he does try to speak Albanian - by the way, Albanians seem to be the last group you can be politically incorrect about) kills everyone he sees no matter how outmanned he is, even shoots someone's wife for no real reason -  it is a joke!  And at the end he comes home free and clear without any ramifications of the destruction he has left behind.  We laughed all the way through it.  At least 007 is supposed to be funny!

920492,B000A3XY5A,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,0,0,1135296000,excellent film... thought provoking and poignant,"This is one of the lastest films that focuses on the issue of race.  Other reviewers have explained very well who the characters are and give good overviews on what kinds of things happen in this film so I won't repeat what was said and will concentrate on what I've got out of this film.Although I don't regard this film as a masterpiece, it's one of the more poignant films I've seen on the issue of race in a long time.  It's not as poignant as ""American History X"" but I think it's a film that makes us think more about how we perceive things.  All of the characters in this film who seemed to espouse certain extreme views all had very serious problems that they were dealing with in their personal lives.  ""Misery loves company"" and race is one of those things that seem to empower different people.  The film showed that when many of us feel weak, vulnerable, impotent, hurt, etc. we look for things to impower us which so many times happens to be race.  Which leads me to the premise that people who are truely happy with themselves and their lives have no reason to show any animosity towards anyone or anything.  There was one character in this film who seem to have that quality.It's healthy to stand up for injustice, but when one just does things with the intention to hurt somebody because they are hurt, it becomes counter productive.  Mean-spirited and spiteful attacks (whether verbal or physical) do nothing but show others how miserable the perpetrators are.  We must constantly remind ourselves that there is nothing empowering about resorting to physical or verbal violence when we can't deal with our own problems.  In fact, it's my opinion that one who resorts to mean-spirited and spiteful attacks show not only that they are very miserable people, but that they are also impotent (no pun intended, but that may very well be the case as well :-) ).",0.0,332,0.08422326641151393,0.0,0.07144973783496979,0.04901937306070065,0.0,0.12795032074213247,0.20657446689936054,0.12971111167317945,0.0,0.07291501580458949,0.05179255470199176,0.0,0.0,0.14976705096142456,0.0,0.04266445753105377,0.04998791354262538,0.051575450869273974,0.0,0.0,0.27891556242074766,0.0,0.058143318097454225,0.0,0.0,0.039016246492711924,0.0,0.04766523561667202,0.0,0.10245981083611802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10239010646223903,0.0,0.1567332936528077,0.0,0.07208018091543292,0.14021549808528597,0.0,0.041088100169631776,0.0,0.0,0.10527557858312817,0.04797228378573233,0.08452074835678891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041466641735141835,0.09565815881117715,0.06737351911743379,0.20954256626145384,0.12860194274041215,0.20600961918741842,0.04747055584307505,0.12821671123420914,0.04894921199231089,0.04167258769330495,0.16242882843333437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16687032786715308,0.07692868234238256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.344409120410396,0.22248125212356026,0.09704488943715606,0.0,0.0,0.08180724495937695,0.1615320268689311,0.13541383149323005,0.04364820855925623,0.255982782121203,0.0,0.0,0.044044667926676107,0.17026267435594078,0.062320992400801155,0.0,0.0,0.2037311595765702,0.13325439250761076,0.04946413409791184,0.1262628825151565,0.13037247411776665,0.09597776063657941,0.20367920162727968,0.04496266704173516,0.12245914915018599,0.0,0.0,
634924,B00005JNTI,APDMVBRLIBCZV,6,12,1141516800,Another example of when good movies are needlessly re-made for box-office success and not substance or originality.,"The original 1953 film ""War Of The Worlds"" is a sci-fi classic that modern day Hollywood feels the need to re-make with a lot of over-the-top special effects that look even more obviously fake to me than what was seen in the original film.The screenplay was adapted from H.G. Wells' novel, and instead of earning a place right next to the novel ""War Of The Worlds"" in the bookcase, this screenplay belongs in the fire place next to the bookcase. So many things in this film are just laughably bad. For example, the scene that has Tom Cruise's character standing and watching with pride as his kids do the work. The special effects are over done and not at all scary, haunting, eerie, or even thrilling, they're quite dull and used just for the sake of seeing how much they could do with special effects to top other movies' special effects. It was actually eerie in the original 1953 film without all the forced effects.This pathetic, unoriginally bad remake should have made Steven Spielberg swing his tail (if he had one) between his legs and run home in shame. It's far worse than his film ""1941"" which was considered to be one of his worst efforts as a director. However, he has since redeemed himself with the admirable film ""Munich"" (2005), as he did with ""1941"" (1979), coming back two years later with the adventure classic ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" (1981). Great directors like Spielberg do make a bad choice for a project every now and then, and in my opinion, this is Spielberg's worst. The Cruise/Spielberg collaboration in the futuristic ""Minority Report"" (2002) was much better than this disaster. Which brings me to this disasterous remake's star, Tom Cruise, who is no longer an actor, but continues to be primarily a star as he has been for years. Once upon a time, Cruise was an actor and a star when he managed to turned in some good performances such as the film that made him a star ""Risky Business"", then his great performance in ""Rain Man"", and, yes, even in ""The Firm"", but his ego obviously took over turning him into just a ""movie star"" using film choices just as vehicles for his fading stardom kept mostly by his tabloid news making personal life; i.e. ""Mission: Impossible III"" coming to theaters soon. So, his performance in ""War Of The Worlds"" is your standard Tom Cruise performance, about as good as anyone can do with such a seemingly stupid and arrogant character. Dakota Fanning (who as young as she is, is an actress and not just a 'child star') is the only decent thing about this film as Cruise's daughter, but nothing at all can save this pointless, money making trashing of a classic. If you want to see ""War Of The Worlds"", do yourself a favor and rent the classic or buy it on dvd.A personal note on remakes and the originals: There is only ONE remake of a classic that was far and away better than the original to me, and it is ""12 Angry Men"" (1997). It was not released in theaters but premiered on Showtime. It was the only remake that worked better than the original because of the one thing that never works in remakes, modernizing. It used basically the same original screenplay by Reginald Rose, but it is modernized and accompanied with stronger performances by a better ensamble cast than the performances given by the actors in the original 1957 film. Plus, it was not made for the sake of making money at all. Premiering on cable and then going to video and dvd proves that without question. In my opinion, 12 Angry Men is the ONLY remake ever to surpass the original.",0.5,630,0.051450466200766765,0.0,0.08729469844045867,0.0,0.07099947745291164,0.2344875923199909,0.04206419864718834,0.21790495656618547,0.07039562253730132,0.04454246096147071,0.03163913249488862,0.030253477102239114,0.0,0.09148997565387562,0.09810260671271208,0.05212588691229968,0.15268354967411363,0.0,0.06048488791297121,0.08655604709342271,0.24340637058446454,0.0,0.10655609607767029,0.023797259608457903,0.0,0.04766863497423399,0.0492231704184495,0.029117828107791215,0.07566250601020487,0.020863613500033924,0.12975029196424284,0.0,0.06728920562754241,0.25209156760168183,0.031274129681036475,0.0486640121904319,0.2553214053139194,0.030578310252713473,0.1614524100421422,0.1284826578052509,0.0,0.12549987664349005,0.023875638711656422,0.0,0.03215547097872311,0.08791619479937408,0.02581609626339541,0.0,0.01900199108380461,0.031201747671739798,0.05820910178915198,0.050662439013682274,0.029217917307403456,0.08231452224238027,0.18489720025151726,0.07856059483598914,0.0838983604779475,0.11599560705718975,0.052216842596258486,0.029902185992875092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0279913458065004,0.0,0.03331481441097546,0.0,0.04699433706818557,0.026315412261520264,0.0,0.17486658199329594,0.14026219091156378,0.49421731851532236,0.0,0.0,0.0961014940623789,0.024987281253110293,0.049338493048668615,0.11029580553695721,0.026663899120576325,0.19902303243744865,0.0,0.0324925256780016,0.0,0.0,0.1903538208461907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025710568453126616,0.026547393449582866,0.05863107357449317,0.04976957235508455,0.0,0.1496161472423009,0.0,0.02052036128054256,

275048,6301963717,ALJGB7XHPFCR,1,1,1081987200,Best Irish Mob Film,"While not given much attention upon release, Miller's Crossing has developed a devoted cult following, particularly among fans of the Coen Bros. Ratcheting up the elements that made Blood Simple so popular (grotesque, humorous violence, bizarre but consistent characters, random chance undoing complex plans, incredible plot complexity, etc. etc. etc.), Miller's Crossing nonetheless manages to be far more emotionally powerful than the earlier film. This one bears quite a few repeat viewings, with a plot full of more twists and turns than most of us can follow in one sitting. Like most of the Coens' films, this is tremendously enjoyable, even when you're not quite sure what's happening or why. This is one of my all-time favorites. A perfect script, great cinematogrophy, a top-notch cast, and, of course, flawless production and direction make this one a classic waiting to be discovered. Simply put, one of the best films ever made. Miller's Crossing is a morality play created with infinite style. Complex characters, complex plot, excellent acting, and great editing. Probablly Gabriel Byrne's best work. If you consider yourself a sophisticated moviegoer, this is not one to miss. But a caveat to the mainstream, you can't eat popcorn and watch this movie at the same time; it requires your full attention. And if you thought that the Road to Perdition was a great film you will probably not understand why so many of us love Miller's Crossing.",1.0,236,0.0,0.0,0.061234958740128735,0.0,0.0,0.21931592330058916,0.0,0.0,0.06584092915253062,0.12498150782981833,0.0,0.0,0.17356475221078477,0.10268453840864922,0.0,0.14625981148417225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08095575206230177,0.13659458662306234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20717263683690731,0.0,0.07076703803679152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136546151454673,0.04477533000051965,0.0,0.16473405550373832,0.040056551174527326,0.0,0.0,0.0669925563646781,0.0831904572156325,0.0902249036346483,0.0,0.14487455644042002,0.1733894369256219,0.05331760855056827,0.0,0.08166433953122312,0.07107676452523919,0.0,0.230965979069786,0.319262949514595,0.0,0.3531150963814179,0.0,0.07325751183166318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13186121690323926,0.0,0.0,0.16355247416222593,0.09839027600430919,0.2773444678644227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23210891000001088,0.14963224953351403,0.19944210976266472,0.0,0.0,0.07549568423728067,0.0,0.05341130022228232,0.08477474500608449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07214117817183636,0.07448922198417204,0.0,0.0,0.07706919982005174,0.10495183289381878,0.0,0.28788998617221334,
974313,B000EMGF2Q,A21X0EO0R0T6FT,5,5,1335398400,Why World War One differs from World War Two,"Some historians argue, and Winston Churchill is among them, that the two world wars of the twentieth century ought to be viewed as a single conflict, as another Thirty Years War. This is quite wrong.World War One closed an era. It marked the end of the autocratic rule of the nobility in central Europe, of those born to the position. World War Two by contrast marks the birth of the military industrial complex, of a ruling system in which corporations and their lobbies have unprecedented influence. Today we are familiar with these powerful corporations, but we are not familiar with the aristocratic European ruling families of the nineteenth century.Fall of Eagles fixes that by dramatizing the story of the political changes in Europe which lead to the war, and to the birth of the Soviet Union. We are shown key episodes in the fall of the imperial houses of Austria, Germany, and Russia; they are the eagles of the title.Each episode of the 13 part series is self contained but also part of the larger story. We see a young British princess married to the heir to the Prussian throne. We see an Empress grieving at the suicide of her son. We see Bismarck rise, rule, and fall in three stages ranging over twenty five years. We see his inept successors unable to maintain the harmony among the nations of Europe. We see Lenin in the background ready to take the power lost by the Czar.As usual for a BBC series, the costumes and dialogues are first rate. The production is not as slick as today's high definition shows, but the dialogue and content is more erudite. Patrick Stewart's magnificent portrayal of Lenin deserves special mention.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo",1.0,288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04732232517557504,0.07480058295589254,0.14410746930220056,0.16618572558169165,0.15652565052909181,0.037082199702282215,0.035195351068792895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674927454588889,0.11627407678498924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046247544344332966,0.028065199879111817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03297088601963297,0.0,0.04951857864750236,0.0,0.03983817252889647,0.0,0.0,0.15130719601192394,0.0,0.11597461530738584,0.022560207596666614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04079732244708706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504105174805049,0.4045764292607322,0.0,0.033146262996915525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22117440780830114,0.10999602580083591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04158639433350438,0.08692083168755096,0.0,0.05541428273440802,0.6248115314318238,0.04684260046416826,0.04933999669193669,0.0,0.0,0.03898494933980303,0.021787635401680935,0.0,0.1797241257304915,0.0,0.10269624297034127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39335599702350094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926550160656583,0.0,0.0,0.05910981021353881,0.0,0.0,

The humor is more adult in nature (that, and the at times intense scenes of the house attacking people, facture into the PG rating) and i have to say, this was the most enjoyable movie i've seen in a very long time. The cast including Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Fred Willard and Catherine O Hara are spot on perfect. The writing is smart, and laugh out loud funny which makes it ideal for the adult, and older child viewer.

156208,079284632X,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,2,4,1119312000,Meh,"This is Wes Craven's first film, and a somewhat deservedly infamous movie.  Certainly, it tried to push the borders of what a film could do, particularly back in 72.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the execution in this film is just so botched that it doesn't much matter how extreme it's trying to be.  The performances are too weak, and the effects are too lame for this movie really to work.  And mind you, this is coming from a horror fan's perspective, and one who can and has accepted the budgetary limits of these sorts of films.  'Night of the Living Dead', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Martin' and 'Cannibal Holocaust' were all made on similarly miniscule budgets, and are each masterpieces of the horror genre, each unquestionably in my top ten of the genre, and readily overcaming their budgetary limits.  'The Last House on the Left', however, just can't pull it off, for a number of reasons.David Hess is pretty much the only high point of the film.  He's sufficiently vicious and sleazy, though his performance faulters greatly at times. (See the final minutes of the film)  Unfortunately, his performances is completely negated by the rest of the gang, who are horrible and dated walking cliches, who aren't remotely frightening or convincing.  Junior is particuarly horrible,  He's meant to be the 'good one', but he's just so stupid and obnoxious that he's almost unbearable to watch.  The cops are even worse, and really hurt the film.  The whole movie has got a theoretically comic subplot involving the police investigating the girls' disappearance, which totally kills an already not very good movie.  The cops are, again, unrelentingly obnoxious, and the whole subplot just ruins whatever little mood the film may have created.  And don't give me any of this crap about how the cop subplot is satirical and whatnot: It's filler, plain and simple, regardless of what it may have been intended to be.  The film would've been all of 50 minutes without it, so Craven had to dump some extra stuff in.Finally, the shocking violence is largely just boring and unconvincing.  It's occasionally uncomfortable, particularly the sexual stuff, but mostly they just sit around, or wander around the forest, attempting to escape.  And the final killings are largely just stagey and melodramatic.  The  parents' revenge is equally lame, particularly the dads' endless chasing of Krug about the house, and the oral castration scene, a scene infinitely funnier than one would imagine such a scene could be. (Krug's making Junior commit suicide is pretty good, however.  The rest of it is pretty lame, however)This movie finds itself in a tough place.  Do what it's trying to do well, and it would be too unbearable.  Do what it actually did, and it's just kinda boring and stupid, for the most part.  This film is historically significant, and something of a curiosity, so serious horror fans shouldn't hesitate to see it.  But, it's just not very good.Grade: D+",0.5,498,0.05733722008941572,0.0,0.04864130207866961,0.0,0.02637431666842334,0.3484222834606213,0.16406954840945231,0.0,0.026150001485587618,0.12409707219688869,0.0,0.06742991475771434,0.0,0.06117473279528853,0.02733177737633569,0.058089919702262675,0.13612238625845413,0.035111354661235744,0.0,0.032153146438618975,0.24413034720069074,0.032613312128693804,0.05937390643686001,0.02652004563711376,0.0,0.10624537411242899,0.0,0.03244937202760116,0.05621300226506924,0.046501487253544936,0.11567663574498561,0.0,0.0,0.05618697268110679,0.06970477778099486,0.0,0.08891695189467583,0.0,0.21263880260639048,0.23863853826274853,0.0,0.25174631530843405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0326584032038731,0.0,0.03443248820719249,0.10588060958065555,0.0,0.06486915137888624,0.02822951501215757,0.0,0.04586630818805025,0.269453123794959,0.04377458990254393,0.07012325322418832,0.03231683861372064,0.05819128216706871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06310723347211006,0.062388004370787946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10474247743141293,0.029326315114322713,0.0,0.032479017970764426,0.05861640844374013,0.5507636617545674,0.033032939835319394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02749180176300774,0.1075509791455098,0.0,0.1584246010410974,0.1059731284814688,0.0,0.0,0.05795541332284702,0.0,0.033669933525903396,0.0,0.0,0.030238819416633173,0.03367401983018583,0.11460907011170599,0.0,0.03266970173313358,0.08319600777019942,0.0,0.0,0.0934718286479442,0.022868217879029807,

The premise looked interesting, and though I was expecting scene changes, more visuals, and action, I was pleasantly surprised that it had none of these.

These actors do their job fitting into the different characters in my own mind, asking the questions I would ask.This isn't a movie for any person susceptible to modern pop media, with short attention spans, but rather those who like to ponder quietly on alternative theories in the company of a few friends.

39194,0780656172,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,2,3,1178928000,Fitting Epitaph for a Storied Director,"Robert Altman's final film is kind of a change of pace for him albeit a refreshing one.  Altman's repertoire consists of films that for the most part employ large cats and skewer revered institutions.  It is with no little irony that Altman has chosen for a last vehicle a film that pays tribute to a beloved institution, live radio.  This is a gentle film, Woody Harrelson and John C Reilly's tribute to bad ribald jokes aside.  The cast is uniformly excellent, not least Garrison Keillor, and the songs are generally good.  Altman wasn't the flashiest of directors, usually allowing his actors and collaborators to take center stage.  If you're going to have a film be your valedictory I can think of worse ways to go out.  To paraphrase another Robert, ""Thanks for the memories, ""Mr. Altman.""",0.6666666666666666,136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23372701099813317,0.09433745929059961,0.0,0.0,0.09989546295414181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11690282693413823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4367103487444067,0.0,0.31863141576221304,0.0,0.0,0.10690653943126613,0.0,0.0,0.11312563193275929,0.09358173232884419,0.0,0.0,0.15090963101015534,0.11307324880045809,0.0,0.10913887383039385,0.0,0.0,0.26333791333781753,0.06403295644943408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13858704678637696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13105415879484578,0.09230346875495221,0.3189763899841529,0.0,0.09407950728505633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11418505212359141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359247141989904,0.27709553293287875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0618401538564796,0.0,0.3825851468731691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388610536760073,0.0,0.09204210750183758,

With the popularity of Nascar at an all time high, it's just a matter of time before Hollywood tries to remake this one, too.  The Lord knows there aren't any original ideas coming out of Tinseltown over the past decade.But anyway, if you want to see the most beautiful woman/actress/starlet/perfect creation ever to grace a movie screen, then buy this movie and watch Diane Lane over and over and over again.This film (not 'A Little Romance' when she was about 5) made me realize when I was just a little tiny lad that I was going to end up a straight guy.  I was in love with her immediately when watching this and she still looks better than any of these hags that get paid twice her salary today.Oh yeah, not only does she look her absolute best in this feature, where you'll want to watch every scene that she graces in slow motion on your DVD player, but she can act, too.  When she has the heart to heart with C Thomas Howell and then he asks her if she can see the sky when it's setting in the North and she's looking west...it's magic. Oh wait, wrong picture....but the scene where Kenny Rogers picks her up when she runs away in the rain is a true tear jerker that will capture your soul and never let go.",0.8571428571428571,246,0.10028293118558351,0.0,0.04253687518792744,0.0,0.04612874114583252,0.1777391535181491,0.0,0.0,0.045736413369754154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06028339329128601,0.10699474982636699,0.0,0.10159940455769385,0.0,0.0,0.05894603392586778,0.0,0.04744272717803035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05671522045541994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04915833579908419,0.0,0.05057967618635735,0.3053759216939688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09485180885755996,0.15551595550290095,0.0,0.11443254151442081,0.11130116213522348,0.0,0.09784553122708745,0.0,0.057788266183463714,0.0,0.05711962310027681,0.0,0.060222501893978486,0.11111125933108747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203304194182955,0.11088803287404123,0.038280929734892256,0.04088191095082779,0.05652222583831897,0.0,0.0,0.04961870302624108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10911676463150562,0.0,0.5844099653440833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056805877910686295,0.1366936461200997,0.24082173108985871,0.0,0.0,0.12487531182947999,0.048703111778278435,0.0,0.13436208033519653,0.10394206925993789,0.16625099723564,0.12356483199400757,0.0,0.1048861814786825,0.0,0.148408677521736,0.1177775839685202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050112882492961856,0.31046370931676265,0.057139384254210675,0.0,0.05353613362411957,0.10935721461398672,0.0,0.07999313243032552,

That was my first mistake, as I believe there is more humor on Death Row than there is in an ordinary conversation with my boss.  My second mistake was renting any movie that has BOTH Whoopi ""Hollywood Square"" Goldberg and Breckin ""Anybody Can Have a Career in Hollywood, I'm Living Proof"" Meyer.""Rat Race"" is a dumbed down version of the ""Cannonball Run"" movies of the early 1980's, only a lot more annoying.  The only saving grace is Cuba Gooding, Jr., who was the only good thing about this movie, but he isn't on screen very long (my only guess is he owed director Jerry Zucker a favor, a very BIG favor at that).  The story gets grating as there are too many participants in the race from Las Vegas to New Mexico and too many ""loony"" happenings that may be ""loony"", but also not funny. With the exception of Gooding (and Amy Smart in her equestrian pants when her mouth is shut), nobody is that interesting to watch.  The best of the rest of the cast, including Jon Lovitz and Wayne Knight are totally wasted here.Don't even get me started on the awful Rowlan Atkinson of ""Bean"" fame (or infamy), who can clear out a room faster than a Doors organ solo with his appearance.To top it all off, the ending of this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen and is definitely not worth the 100+ minutes it takes you to get there.  I'm tempted to spill my guts about it to keep people from spending their money either renting or (shudder) buying it, but I won't, so you'll have to see it for yourselves.",0.23529411764705882,304,0.10176363089817052,0.0,0.043164941580886726,0.05922816342263016,0.04680984223600941,0.12883107966158622,0.0831985772190341,0.07836239470460798,0.04641172165333463,0.0440501601957469,0.0,0.0,0.06117349095860478,0.108574551029256,0.0,0.10309954229149412,0.0,0.06231657081575759,0.0,0.05706626378627751,0.0,0.057882978153729385,0.03512613209011905,0.14120545771538381,0.115105266519442,0.047141782505998715,0.0,0.0,0.09976833905200971,0.12379812391600244,0.1539794889576603,0.12395394595295244,0.0,0.04986107052529766,0.0,0.0,0.15781218306519368,0.0,0.2612748675613715,0.16941682270593492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272003043574694,0.057963006999288906,0.10212306652881825,0.0,0.11275184170948102,0.12342757482720186,0.0,0.30061498708709095,0.0,0.08140474982623186,0.25318196834468665,0.15538462459862368,0.08297108285981157,0.22942715613723952,0.1032794431035559,0.0,0.05035133417733828,0.06541876945320509,0.0,0.0,0.05536394892673118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04647493720513439,0.0,0.05439463514229825,0.11528925858482789,0.17338994763909912,0.36656627601263103,0.05862774462453314,0.0,0.0,0.19768889608641846,0.0,0.05453838649625314,0.0,0.19682335174736773,0.12538929413383873,0.0,0.0,0.10286081677381191,0.15059996454888908,0.059758298054084925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052507962469572324,0.0,0.14765849850629154,0.0,0.11097189813324473,0.0,0.08117424876585946,

Or, one can delve deeper and look at Max Bialystock as a metaphor of desire and frustration.  One HAS to watch the unfortunately-deleted King of Broadway in the deleted scenes.  This shows Max as a deposed king trying to gain back former glory, rather than a simple wannabe.  This scene is a reprise/sendup of Fiddler, complete with Jewish lament and incredibly energetic street dancing.  Only then do we understand Maxes plight, and his striving to get back.  Nathan Lane is brilliant and hold center stage no matter who else is there, but Matthew Broderick is a great straight man, Uma Thurman is dazzling, Roger Bart is hilarious.  The story is not only fun, but all of us can share the aspiration to a dream.",0.5,145,0.0,0.0,0.08156099863459826,0.0,0.0,0.2434288366331341,0.0,0.22210090875009192,0.08769585287874304,0.0832336364650616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20515373087335365,0.0,0.29221289268885586,0.11412397782657889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874682255546353,0.0,0.18396035530281685,0.0,0.0942571108308904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421346481873005,0.0,0.0,0.05963783930245189,0.0,0.4388301830342341,0.05335273155840898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101560101718786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919529163573873,0.15381586181427925,0.21261878447525961,0.0734005693658671,0.15677547861750663,0.3251303132204671,0.1951485212175317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10277972354617793,0.10892065085273568,0.0,0.23087804162652895,0.0,0.0,0.11971912714112438,0.09338425579451685,0.0,0.15457701679794728,0.0,0.21251517730017358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291446918471683,0.0,0.11628116023623186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09300120386271334,0.0,0.06989452165452166,0.0,0.0,
316202,6302497191,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,25,25,1086566400,Still fun after all these years,"I have a weakness for Rutger Hauer movies that needs to be satiated every few months if I am to function. I cannot specify one specific trait about this actor that I find so satisfying. Is it his acting skills, which are substantial even though he often appears in low budget junk? Or is it his presence, a physically imposing stature that makes him a natural to play cops or bad guys equally well? I guess both of these traits play a part. Hauer is a phenomenal entertainer, always turning in a great performance even if the movie is mediocre. Check out the scene in the made for cable television film ""Fatherland"" where Hauer tells his son a story about an old watchmaker. It's a mesmerizing piece of acting that is deeply moving. Most of this actor's films don't have as good a script as that movie does, but even still Hauer manages to stand head and shoulders above his co-stars. One of my latest fixes for this actor's work found me digging up a copy of ""Split Second,"" an apocalyptic sort of tale from the early '90s that I have had a fondness for since I saw it ten years ago.In the near future-London of 2008, to be exact-the world has undergone serious weather disturbances. Global warming melted a significant portion of the earth's icecaps, resulting in serious flooding in port cities around the world. London itself is often under several feet of water, requiring residents to wear waterproof clothing and footwear anytime they go outside. Hauer plays a cop named Harley Stone, a throwback to the old days of police work when a guy pounded a beat and employed tried and true techniques to solve crimes. Stone lives like a slob, constantly eating chocolate truffles, drinking, and generally taking poor care of himself. But he's a good cop, one of the best, and anytime a murder occurs he's not far from the scene. Stone's methods rile the rank and file, especially his boss Paulsen (Pete Postalthwaite). This cop continually hassles Stone about his rogue way of bringing in the bad guys, but can't bring himself to retire his star detective. And now he needs Harley Stone more than ever as a vicious murderer rampages across London. This criminal seems to worship the occult and mutilates the victims in the most heinous of ways.In order to keep an eye on the department renegade, Paulsen assigns an egghead named Dick Durbin (Neil Duncan) to act as Stone's new partner. Durbin's one of these guys with way too much schooling; he's got a ton of degrees, including a doctorate from Oxford, and a tendency to harp on Harley about eating right and exercising. As the two detectives investigate the latest round of zodiac style killings, dropping wisecracks along the way, a former squeeze of Harley's named Michelle (Kim Cattrall) enters the picture. Meanwhile, the gruesome crimes continue, with the criminal specifically targeting Stone in order to mock his adversary. As if by magic, the killer manages to leave a grotesque surprise in a box at the cop shop, addressed to Harley Stone and wrapped with a lot of love. The cops know they have to do something soon before even more citizens fall victim to this nefarious evildoer. Moreover, alarming evidence increasingly points to supernatural origin for the killer. When Durbin and Stone finally confront this creature face to face, all of Durbin's educated veneer collapses like a wet bag. He goes along with Stone completely now, muttering the same line repeatedly until it turns into a mantra: ""We need guns. Big guns."" The inevitable showdown in the sewers of London is more fun than it should be from a movie of this caliber.""Split Second"" was a better film the first time than the second time around. The first viewing came at a time when I could care less about such fundamental cinematic concepts as structured plot, a good script, and believable characters. While the characters in this movie are largely believable and interesting, the script and the plot leave a lot to be desired. The dialogue is the same sort of stuff we hear in every action film made since the 1960s. Durbin and Stone are your typical old cop/young cop team, with all the attendant baggage that clich&eacute; implies. Stone at first despises his new prot&eacute;g&eacute; but soon learns to grudgingly admire the guy. Durbin initially scoffs at Harley's bad behavior and unorthodox police skills, but soon falls in line when he learns the older detective was right all along. Moreover, the plot is the typical B budget potboiler with more holes than a pound of Swiss cheese. How, for instance, did a demonic beast manage to leave a box in the middle of a heavily guarded police station without anyone seeing him? In broad daylight? C'mon! Suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite for watching these types of films, but ""Split Second"" pushes the envelope beyond the tearing point. Another point against the film is Kim Cattrall, who doesn't have much to do except act the part of the imperiled female. Too, her hair makes her look like Moe Howard on a bad day.Yet, despite these immense and inestimable flaws, ""Split Second"" is highly entertaining. The idea has heart even if it rips off ""Aliens"" and every other scary sci-fi flick known to man. Durbin and Stone are fun to watch as they savagely riff off one another. It's too bad the DVD presents few extras and only a full screen picture transfer. Rutger Hauer fans will want to add this one to their collections soon, but unfortunately it looks like it is out of print. Try and find a copy somewhere, though, because it is ultimately an entertaining piece of fluff good for passing a few hours.",1.0,969,0.10623929690782959,0.0,0.05407605452926173,0.0,0.09773717159318594,0.24747484629108296,0.06948618691741948,0.1308941616010055,0.07752472875762227,0.0735800482992797,0.026132468288347886,0.0,0.02554558484786329,0.10579311689434039,0.020257060298179634,0.021526792603396176,0.05044383591308337,0.02602292630772112,0.024978867792366775,0.11915218999757314,0.08041698692602244,0.07251447513468025,0.11734724615178053,0.07862176779569727,0.0,0.07874420020929757,0.020328037442554476,0.02404998682487099,0.041662500054282244,0.08616192594061559,0.15003488313057015,0.05176222566260466,0.0555777890716173,0.18739443654018068,0.02583099275137829,0.08038847181133583,0.22406397162846026,0.02525627790583046,0.16972106473351775,0.12970315862852844,0.0,0.0,0.07888071793336433,0.02448825416756975,0.0,0.024204911149170737,0.08529163270087844,0.05103956323260304,0.0627790827695058,0.02577120854070507,0.04807804091480618,0.02092242227484107,0.0,0.016997002387131047,0.35242288519356724,0.048665578621590634,0.10394428063041278,0.023951759134825997,0.043128710418492845,0.02469783036362735,0.04205266886928861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019407580523339102,0.0,0.022714786184696075,0.09628783615500706,0.1013688538888493,0.5306610074553276,0.024482500528837412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061126989110597496,0.11387407828730621,0.06606946302886814,0.3287677425835041,0.07854242422940644,0.026837331808192977,0.02222319201065425,0.0,0.031444700246649075,0.024954611047741767,0.0792365918374078,0.05139733015311486,0.022411626577891672,0.0,0.0,0.08770770406825733,0.02421328510104949,0.020553688877278768,0.022686377943478872,0.09268204233789899,0.0,0.0,

530137,B00003CXO0,A2JBVXCOTDW8XS,2,3,1005177600,A Solid Comedy,"Meet the Parents, a solid comedy from director Jay Roach (Austin Powers), is a milestone in the careers of both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  For De Niro, it proves that his purely comedic turn in Analyze This was not a fluke.  In Stiller's case, it further places him atop Hollywood's rather slim assortment of comic actors.The story has been told countless times: a all-around nice guy desperately attempts to capture the approval of his fiancee's gruff father.  The plot, however, is simply an excuse to stage several sight gags and screwball antics for the actors to chew on.  This leads to several hit-or-miss set pieces that mostly hit, a rarity in Hollywood these days.  A lot of the credit has to go towards the film's stars, although the funniest performance comes from Owen Wilson as a born-again preppie with an unusual interest in carpentry.  Many of the jokes are pretty obvious, but that doesn't detract from the film's overall appeall.  A charming movie in its own right, Meet the Parents is one of the most satisfying comedies of 2000.",0.6666666666666666,181,0.0,0.0,0.07553766097282272,0.0,0.16383230758642714,0.09018057768018602,0.07279780406531836,0.06856619964517971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471549532445974,0.0,0.06333432739279601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16849910226679213,0.0,0.12293985627840595,0.24710632290395423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745923125370189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11645310179496729,0.17451146709067625,0.0,0.0,0.33140125514372815,0.0,0.15240834840921846,0.09882518889913464,0.11386215076385507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112988123497074,0.0,0.0,0.10694407877646853,0.06577104845724653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07122822560096038,0.34460428847462005,0.06797988519992251,0.0725987491013729,0.0,0.09036833217993752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518936798326849,0.0,0.18205706670049934,0.5559515892237424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544092956638983,0.0,0.24602597569946513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588662377369196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473276160153872,0.0,0.0,

48079,0783219695,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,5,5,1350000000,Apollo 13 on Blu Ray-Universal's 15th anniversary release,"I have seen where others have had some problems with loading and the menu.  I didn't have any issues at all.  Perhaps the loading was a touch slower than normal but I have seen much worse.  This is a great movie that really stands up to the test of time; it has legs.  I prefer to focus on the quality of the remastered release rather than plot summary and my opinions on acting(which was great all around).The video transfer to Blu Ray on this release shows just what can be done if those in charge of the transfers put their minds to it.  The picture quality couldn't get any better with beautiful colors and deep details throughout the entire movie.  At no point did I see any grain, aliasing or artifacts of any kind.  The video is completely demo disc worthy for those who have the system that can show it.  I think that sometimes people complain about a disc simply because they are using cheapo blu ray players or who have sound systems that are simply not up to par.  For me, it was like seeing the movie on a brand new master shown for the very first time in the theater. Never the less, the video quality of the Blu Ray is a huge jump from my previously owned Standard Def DVD.The audio transfer, DTSHD 5.1 MA,  also shows what a good transfer and proper audio editing can achieve.  Hope you have a good sound system as it will certainly get a strong workout in many parts of film.  Your subwoofer will have its boundaries explored both during the early music score as well as in many areas of foley effects.  There is great use of the discreet channels with, when appropriate, marvelous directionality and panning around the front and rear sound stages.  Even small foley fx are clearly delineated to their correct audio channels.  All audio is precise, properly leveled and enveloping when you should be enveloped.While I haven't watched them all, there are some very interesting and historical extras and footage in addition to the Standard Def extra DVD for your tablet or computer and the regular commentary which accompanies most movies on disc.  Thank god there weren't a dozen previews of upcoming movies and advertisements that we see on so many discs taking up room on the DVD.For my part, this is one transfer to blu ray that makes having a hi end system worth having.  A great addition.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",1.0,477,0.03551984237775341,0.0,0.15066403465224573,0.041346304382570226,0.0,0.23383118244940232,0.17423908656505485,0.13675907019454697,0.06479867210147856,0.06150152989070857,0.04368539615567375,0.04177216718920578,0.0,0.025264762435305035,0.0,0.10795839709405146,0.0,0.0,0.1252707998711663,0.03983711423984411,0.03360807609853054,0.04040725045341074,0.12260516494637033,0.03285781345562639,0.08035328314318979,0.06581796145599245,0.13592873951999793,0.040204131901757124,0.06964680104552663,0.2304577019954867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719231797543755,0.13219961948977083,0.0,0.12159474566881051,0.09855614731154387,0.04542086902700566,0.03465652435031058,0.03296603456990969,0.0,0.13319497509971806,0.04046311740616898,0.0,0.04266117373273557,0.10494718948146778,0.08616296341307907,0.0401857995306264,0.13990324917302469,0.0403423290010825,0.028413725582586175,0.2749329105053039,0.24406134060178514,0.02896044253807189,0.040039925616085076,0.1081467762359413,0.0,0.0,0.04566787483928521,0.0,0.03909430876365801,0.1159462602855792,0.0,0.0,0.04691663001531383,0.06488693178387912,0.10900417795874537,0.0,0.08048172528118315,0.14524914779089562,0.4776697194487622,0.08185432181013245,0.08621835524315118,0.0,0.10350276960707228,0.06812360025684175,0.0951811012827537,0.07363179103127926,0.21591345146691956,0.0,0.0,0.11145088968827883,0.07180561397831288,0.07884870492029525,0.0,0.0,0.042960211494524864,0.07493060163664483,0.0,0.0709991886436113,0.07331006309562528,0.08095423212213475,0.06871880843071744,0.07584920007270156,0.10329045312195972,0.0,0.08499981267908083,

949416,B000BT97AO,A96K1ZGW56S2I,1,1,1197158400,Visually Stunning,"The Jim Henson Company teamed together with Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman to bring to life this fantastical tale about a young girl, named Helena (Stephanie Leonidas),struggling into maturity. Helena is a part of a family of circus performers. Even though she spends her free time thinking about fantasy worlds, Helena longs to have a more normal teenage life away from the circus. After a terrible fight with her parents, her mother (Gina McKee) grows very ill and Helena blames herself for her mother's sudden illness. On the evening of her mother's surgery Helena seems to dream herself into a strange world where all the inhabitants wear masks to hide their true selves. The world is in terrible trouble and is being swallowed by a black nothing apparently because of a conflict between the Queen of Light and the Queen of Shadows. The Queen of Light is deathly ill and can only be healed if Helena retrieves an object known as the Mirrormask from the Queen of Shadows. The world is full of stunning beauty and vivid images, including tethered floating giants, moving books, and (my favorite characters in the entire movie) monkey birds. Helena initially believes that the experience is just a dream, but learns that her journey is possibly something much, much more.Visually speaking, MIRRORMASK is a remarkable film. The film had a relatively small budget, yet there are some things in the film that are more visually astounding in my opinion than in many big-budget fantasy epic films. The music in the film is also very impressive; I was enchanted so much by the score that I find myself listening to parts of the soundtrack in my mind weeks after I had seen the film. Yet, that's pretty much all MIRRORMASK is. The characters are not very well developed and the pacing of the story is incredibly slow. The movie combines elements from two other Jim Henson Company films, THE DARK CRYSTAL and LABYRINTH as well as elements from THE NEVERENDING STORY. However, those films succeed on a level that MIRROMASK does not because the audience actually cares about the characters in those movies.It's disappointing because MIRRORMASK could have been such a great movie. I don't think there are too many people who will enjoy watching this movie. I'd recommend it for fans of Neil Gaiman, for people who have to see every Jim Henson Company movie, and for film fans (because of the visual elements).",1.0,409,0.1149317062342698,0.09647008716428995,0.06500056836426,0.044594804772618304,0.035244648074877,0.19400219470451868,0.12528581316856485,0.08850238192676178,0.0,0.03316679398134646,0.1884706981258535,0.04505412680890259,0.0,0.027249766702340777,0.07304825273772088,0.038813494247896714,0.0,0.0469201668435652,0.0,0.04296704043467659,0.21749159177995223,0.0,0.10579041540076176,0.14175755712053145,0.0,0.0,0.03665210042591947,0.08672578795057968,0.0,0.09321162177284639,0.0,0.27998683571144867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036235745214480294,0.1901150557531974,0.09107575060360612,0.24043839096773584,0.0425198064410563,0.0,0.03737942146411295,0.0,0.0,0.09577323374628924,0.0,0.11533765234632501,0.0,0.14149086285490245,0.046466311674234054,0.17337248505869574,0.11317138575792661,0.0,0.06129227577361599,0.27535287526095203,0.05849706118014299,0.0,0.04318578631448839,0.0,0.04453097655630054,0.0,0.09851182557911081,0.0,0.0,0.041685312377682845,0.0,0.049613135971602225,0.0,0.03499248721750466,0.039189476206400564,0.0819109691968522,0.04340251057831971,0.15666109670141987,0.5335992952682928,0.04414272999035828,0.0,0.0,0.07442319006062444,0.0,0.04106371965409841,0.03970845030931404,0.14819468372224717,0.04720483271256091,0.048388565958583984,0.0,0.11617086646892956,0.028347899165377787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08081775629963303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411791433206445,0.040904263632656084,0.055702893651976004,0.0,0.0,

951505,B000BW7QWW,A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ,3,24,1141689600,NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE TV SERIES,"SERENITY, the movie, has somewhat stronger production values than the TV series and the return of the original TV series cast, but except for SERENITY fanatics, the feature film version will be a disappointment. Even die-hard SERENITY fans should expect something more from a feature film over a TV series but it just isn't there. Yes, there are a couple of slap-face kung fu scenes and breakfast-in-your-throat chase sequences but not enough to overcome the ""dead"" spaces where nothing seems to be happening except yak-yak, ho-hum Serenity crew meetings. The cast has visibly aged, which is to be expected, especially Mal and Shepherd. For SERENITY fans, I say, go for it, but for the rest of us, I say, beware: SERENITY, the movie, is not that much better than the TV series, which is saying something about the fine quality of the TV product.",0.125,144,0.08627290665646825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310640936688025,0.07053387367389755,0.0,0.0,0.22406838230288423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24545880222081978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09675897774900293,0.16325896839947604,0.0,0.23823312814347275,0.07980719742631348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16916268663640321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05351584104722309,0.0,0.14766861901353107,0.09575183591192217,0.0,0.08417602360151782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657762806173051,0.0,0.12745128463272784,0.0,0.09760588729393335,0.0,0.0,0.1380262146931298,0.19079284572880184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.466853922700667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19547925632360863,0.058798431761171936,0.49722656842686125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16759617879741404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302490559945907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19662691171437385,0.0,0.09211373868509057,0.0,0.0,0.0,

If the films had finished there and then they  would have done so on a high note.But then the powers-than-be at New  Line Entertainment decided Freddy was too much of a cash cow to dispose of  and so more films were made.  However, these newer films (apart from the  superb 'New Nightmare') are strictly at comedy level.  Part 4:The Dream  Master, despire boasting good camerawork and interesting special effects,  is a non-event, no more than a series of set-pieces strung together by a  very weak storyline.  A new would-be victim is given the power to bring  others into dreams by Kristen, whose character seems to have changed  completely and who is completely miscast.  Freddy, given top billing in the  opening credits, is ludicrously over-the-top and the characters we're  supposed to care about are so smug and irritating it's a relief when they  die in horror comic-book fashion.Gaudy, show-offy and quite uninspiring.",0.5,182,0.08077623155781054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3272364094948695,0.13207994800126377,0.0,0.14735967819457219,0.13986159529589934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05745499315631678,0.1540191850804406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07642865382892852,0.0,0.0,0.07472246976628873,0.0,0.07483883006420819,0.0,0.09142884795319563,0.0,0.13102187013312516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640155294001709,0.15031861574994385,0.09601470509446794,0.18434701422940541,0.044825616578011845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16212307671254317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138715802001093,0.0,0.09174312414780836,0.0,0.17863692882785062,0.12333860639918987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2185547121641689,0.0,0.10669384536465984,0.2213405863872805,0.0,0.0,0.1830247558068169,0.0,0.42675136941370256,0.0,0.0,0.20116996950408159,0.0784590914541138,0.1549209495463537,0.0,0.0,0.223187350872487,0.0995294150614614,0.0,0.0,0.08164713739686666,0.17931107854983908,0.0,0.0,0.09769649185233063,0.0,0.18975879326158748,0.0,0.08335778308293931,0.09204964551838611,0.07813726090255725,0.0,0.05872361052702893,0.17557651762034865,0.0,
1431183,B004X1M4BU,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,8,8,1303689600,"Catherine Oxenberg, the Moldavian Massacre, Rock Hudson and more in DYNASTY's fifth year","The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.The fifth season is one of my personal favourites, although in true DYNASTY style, it has divided fans for years.  Producers brought in a new supervising writer, Camille Marchetta (who'd previously worked on the first few *good* years of ""Dallas"", including the J.R. shooting storyline) and Marchetta gave the characters bold and exciting new directions in some of DYNASTY's best stories to date.  Not content to keep the action squarely in Denver, in this season the characters travel everywhere from Bolivia, Acapulco, London and Paris.  The gamble paid off, and DYNASTY was rating through the roof by the time of the season finale that year (with sixty million tuning in).Jailed for the murder of Mark Jennings, the first few episodes this season focus on the trial of Alexis (Joan Collins) and the events which cause another face from her past to suddenly re-appear in Denver...  She and Dex (Michael Nader) later tie the knot in England but it's never going to be plain sailing for this unlikely pair...despite their mutual love of eating caviar for breakfast.Krystle (Linda Evans) finally gives Blake (John Forsythe) a child and you'd think that the golden Carrington couple couldn't be happier...think again!  Baby Krystina (aka ""Kwythteena"" to the diehard fans) is born prematurely--there's never a simple birth in DYNASTY Land--and it's touch-and-go for a while.  After all the baby drama, Krystle announces plans to establish her own horse-breeding business, which Blake is less than thrilled about.  He complains that Krystle is being naive and selfish, after all, he's the breadwinner and she should just be content aimlessly wandering the Carrington mansion, solving everyone else's problems!  What dreams could she possibly have?  After all, she's a Stepfor...erm...Carrington wife!Steven (Jack Coleman) finds himself torn between wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) and his twinky new co-worker Luke (Bill Campbell) ...hey...wasn't it ever meant to be a marriage of convenience?!?  Adam (Gordon Thomson) cheers and schemes from the sidelines...can't he find a woman of his own?!  Of all the DYNASTY ladies I've always felt a great admiration for Pamela Bellwood's Claudia, because, despite her nuttier moments in earlier seasons, in many ways she's truly the strongest positive female presence this year.Following her crazed ""Runaway Bride"" act in the previous season, Fallon has supposedly died with nutjob Peter De Vilbis in a plane crash, and Jeff (John James) buries his sorrows in booze and babes, until he hooks up with Peter's ex-wife Nicole (Susan Scannell) for a bizarre ""Indiana Jones"" jaunt to Bolivia, where a treasure map supposedly owned by both Peter and Fallon leads them to a priceless artifact...and possibly even Fallon herself!Dazzling lounge singer/entrepeneur Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll) ramps up her mission to make Blake aware of her true place in his family; something he's not even remotely convinced of, despite Dominique gallantly investing millions in Denver-Carrington when the business is threatened with bankruptcy.  It's only after the pair visits Blake's father's deathbed that the truth is revealed...And let's not forget the explosive season cliffhanger...the Moldavian Wedding Massacre!  It's a real pain getting blood stains out of Nolan Miller garments...  Plus, as if that's not enough, scheming Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) brews up the outlandish plan to destroy her Aunt Krystle using lookalike actress Rita (Linda Evans again, but channeling Ann-Margret in a deliciously trashy red wig)...  This key storyline would unfold in the next season.New characters:  This season sees the arrival of Alexis' secret daughter from England, Amanda Bedford (Catherine Oxenberg)...but could she also be a Carrington?  Millionaire race-horse breeder Daniel Reece (Rock Hudson in his final screen appearance before dying from AIDS) turns out to be another figure from Krystle's ever-complicated past; and globe-trotting celebrity photo journalist Lady Ashley Mitchell (Ali MacGraw, in one of the show's early attempts at stunt-casting) sets her sights on Blake...and Jeff.  Oh, and let's not forget dreamy Michael (Michael Praed), the crown prince of Mouldy Diva--whoops, Moldavia.Of all the new faces introduced this season, none is more effective than Catherine Oxenberg.  A true ""blue blood"" in her own right, Oxenberg first came to the attention of viewers playing Princess Diana no less, in a TV miniseries.  She gives the role of Amanda a true grace and poise, and if nothing else, adds an extra layer of gloss to the DYNASTY cast roster.  And she more than fills the gaping void left by the departure of Pamela Sue Martin (Fallon) in the previous year.Includes the following episodes:Disappearance / The Mortgage / Fallon / The Rescue / The Trial / The Verdict / Amanda / The Secret / Domestic Intrigue / Krystina / Swept Away / That Holiday Spirit / The Avenger / The Will / The Treasure / Foreign Relations / Triangles / The Ball / Circumstantial Evidence / The Collapse / Life and Death / Parental Consent / Photo Finish / The Crash / Reconciliation / Sammy Jo / Kidnapped / The Heiress / Royal Wedding",1.0,875,0.02151933012338036,0.10837592448970171,0.12778955184795,0.025049232030026035,0.019797179782392156,0.305122913755204,0.0,0.016570814406125994,0.01962880355265515,0.1304102362723333,0.0264663466534238,0.0,0.025871964966641264,0.04591918715900242,0.08206348885458845,0.021801827102259603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04826980949819425,0.0,0.07344094767968283,0.10399070434363362,0.11943940415573355,0.02434060388087119,0.019937566523472408,0.02058775618904381,0.0,0.0421947960184297,0.01745255270270628,0.10853698994633858,0.23590601805017417,0.0,0.10543814400772529,0.0,0.040707772767995,0.3070184740959068,0.0,0.08594474283985523,0.0716510703104002,0.0,0.020996297801433927,0.0,0.02480112542698604,0.02689826726015582,0.0,0.04319067553799485,0.0258458320631682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021189735108266244,0.024440983900988377,0.08607081280712077,0.2974379784697333,0.04928734858401301,0.03509077077922403,0.024257775929427582,0.0,0.0,0.04258994977877764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029112220949024697,0.222944526570139,0.028423956357654618,0.0,0.022013018952200144,0.0,0.07313853465928001,0.08799769796865976,0.6201241552402811,0.04959059655514899,0.026117250598137392,0.0,0.020902028450946096,0.0,0.08073028380921655,0.04460906109679854,0.20215926698426734,0.0,0.0,0.06752137192051957,0.0,0.03184644970991484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02150706304753969,0.022207072772775973,0.04904528650194886,0.0416325812648348,0.02297622774617204,0.06257745560034157,0.023387381236531918,0.017165419917631243,

The movie opens with Burt blowing away an army of Shriekers in Argentina. Shortly after he returns to Perfection, Nevada; a place that has expanded some since the end of the original movie. Melvin, Miguel, and Mindy and her mother still live in the town, but there are several newcomers too. Tourists arrive by the dozens to see the famed town where the Graboids first appeared. However, three more of the creatures suddenly arise and trouble soon ensues. Burt is called upon to hunt the monsters down, but is prevented from doing so by the U.S. Department of the Interior because the ""animals"" are an ""endangered species"". Most of the graboids soon morph into Shriekers and not long after complete their evoluntionary phase my morphing into Butt-Blasters.TREMORS was a great movie. TREMORS 2 was a fairly well made sequel. TREMORS 3 has a lot of heart, but not much stamina. The film still has a lot of campy fun that the first two movies did. The special effects aren't bad, but the CGI stuff doesn't look as real as the animatronics. Having some of the other original cast members back in the film is nice, too.It's especially a treat to see Michael Gross as the lead for once. However, even though he is the film's lead and carries the movie, he's often designated to a secondary stature by the two newcomers to the series. The film would have worked much better if Burt would have either taken on the Graboids single-handed or if he had been given a romantic interest or even better yet, a little bit of both. The lack of a ""buddy"" element really hurt the movie.Overall, not too bad of a sci-fi flick. If you're a TREMORS fan, you'll want to watch to see how things tie together. However, if you're not a fan of the series, the movie is just average.",1.0,333,0.0,0.10612157751743313,0.0,0.0,0.07754150043179842,0.1280468560715181,0.06891010739608862,0.12980897547545617,0.0,0.0,0.051831630894211375,0.04956163253474354,0.0,0.11990403717619402,0.12053470733706294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09453148112985385,0.15950056986514113,0.09588438587063738,0.029093592891219874,0.0389849745886232,0.0,0.0,0.04031901318697836,0.04770119784946528,0.12395128357850999,0.06835807614054817,0.17004686819635814,0.05133308773598089,0.0,0.04129796253289943,0.05123367862336486,0.15944401244840445,0.1045676966787913,0.1001875567001322,0.1202242726936781,0.023386881197569306,0.0,0.041119100117585794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04229225857788334,0.05061641658345797,0.18677582672722837,0.05111510149139536,0.09535889389844429,0.04149792728327646,0.0,0.13484870151827552,0.30290095464399897,0.03217474242559042,0.0,0.0,0.08554229836572301,0.04898614295329198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04638442042923036,0.13756734047393493,0.11402660975464658,0.0,0.0,0.03849336155834644,0.08622048884484905,0.0,0.0,0.05744482808525229,0.6477064979945688,0.0485590536942831,0.0,0.0,0.04093448324382131,0.0,0.022585999642589945,0.0,0.186309756184028,0.15578252682737798,0.10645934100974112,0.0,0.0,0.062368012036970545,0.049495446609300484,0.0,0.0,0.044451643209001204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03063788538185164,0.09160358456026728,0.10085015370261273,

1170345,B001B3LIQU,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,5,8,1241049600,Farcical German-occupied France. One of top ten Britcoms,"A review for those who have never seen the show: These are the French (picture a cafe favored by the occupying Germans in a small French town) and over there in the dark, scheming to foil the Germans are the French resistance. The ONLY problem is that the resistance can't seem to accomplish anything without help, and that help is conveniently sought from the town's cafe owner. This character is a Lou Costello sort of fellow, but with considerably more intelligence; nevertheless, not enough to extricate himself out of the crazy schemes dreamt up by the French resistance leader. This is the plot of the show. Picture an ensemble Laurel and Hardy task-based sitcom wherein the caricatured players are stealing/concealing/and playing hot potato with paintings to sell after the war; and are fashioning schemes (in a more adult manner, but reminiscent of the American classic rerun ""Gilligan's Island"") to return 2 airmen that were forced to bail out of their plane and dropped into this town, back to England. The series is known for it's tag lines; think of The Honeymooners ""Bang Zoom""/""I've got a BIG mouth""/etc, ""Yes Minister""(from that eponymously named Britcom), & ""I know nothing"" (from Hogan's Heroes, a show which is more similar to 'Allo 'Allo than not), and multiply by 10. In addition, it's full of innuendo and farcical stereotypes, but remains unoffensive and amusing...as well as being addictively likable. Do give this Britcom a try if any of the above makes sense and seems at all appealing to you. I hope I have given you a feel whether this may be so or not in your individual case.

1522299,B006X040NY,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0,0,1393632000,Bond grows up,"****1/2Seems James Bond, aka 007, ain't quite as young and as spry as he used to be. After years of chasing the bad guys and suffering one too many injuries and wounds on the job, the world's premier secret agent is beginning to feel his age.In this outing, a noticeably creakier Bond goes in pursuit of an ex-agent who's targeting MI6 and particularly its chief, M, for wrongs he believes he's suffered at their hands.In addition to providing a more relatable Bond - replete with autobiographical back story - and M, &#34;SkyFall&#34; is that rare action movie that actually finds time to probe some surprisingly heady themes amid all the obligatory shootouts and chase scenes (which are excellent, by the way, especially the tour de force opening scene).For instance, the script ponders whether MI6's old-school reliance on secret agents has become a hopelessly antiquated business model for a world in which technology has begun to replace time-consuming footwork and in which the enemy is no longer out in the open but operating in the shadows.The movie also questions M's practice of cutting loose her most loyal and valued agents (Bond included) - essentially treating them as disposable assets - when a greater goal is to be achieved through their sacrifice.The dialogue between Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M is some of the best in the whole Bond series, and there is a genuine connection between the two individuals who, although they're working for the same team, often seem more like adversaries than allies.&#34;Skyfall&#34; also provides us with one of the most effective villains we've come across in quite awhile, in the person of Javier Bardem as the former operative who's decided to exact his revenge on the people and the organization that he feels has done him wrong.Director Sam Raimi even manages to achieve some genuine lyricism in his direction, something one almost never finds in an action film.It seems to me that the Bond franchise has really upped its game since Craig hopped aboard in 2006's &#34;Casino Royale&#34; (despite the stumble of &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34;). Happily, &#34;Skyfall&#34; restores that upward trajectory.",0.0,355,0.0,0.05736379169295859,0.03865114226777188,0.10606923521103924,0.08382978433577158,0.2537899983993984,0.037249211128238854,0.24558787394010576,0.04155840343612518,0.07888758544725358,0.0,0.0,0.054776520376532814,0.03240693538781049,0.043436518787891516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05109878988624127,0.043108845904354834,0.0,0.12581183516142252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1786709364261492,0.0,0.18383694161827638,0.055495981509687604,0.059586772307127805,0.13394115177142077,0.0,0.0,0.36740499074479255,0.0,0.1559687361587818,0.025283457195968473,0.11652206677862662,0.0,0.04228530369264451,0.0,0.05694942330700863,0.051901759801972834,0.091443959580714,0.10944238278631002,0.06730751570229773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0517468253532814,0.0,0.20151687755495234,0.1043519291054434,0.111442075800666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045086046902520736,0.058577866030010195,0.0,0.050145998458492234,0.0,0.0616368399569381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13981890236078953,0.04870653601022027,0.05161667515705906,0.15525839462662064,0.5032922700909647,0.10499397035323768,0.05529584287132756,0.0,0.044254094686289894,0.04369083456774341,0.024417627573655867,0.09444698720400303,0.22659601526644582,0.05613860773262901,0.05754636902612213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05663476765420801,0.055104765054282294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04701715450718734,0.15575914733829707,0.13221770779227393,0.0,0.06624497358865832,0.0,0.0,

29957,0780620135,A1GARI2JT6EAWA,7,7,1247875200,A history teacher's review,"When this first came out on PBS I started watching it and never got into the flow of it. I hated the fact that they used actors to play real people rather than using the tried and true (and fantastic) Ken Burns style. Ironically, I absolutely loved the book Liberty ! : The American Revolution By Thomas Fleming by - it is, hands down, the best single-volume comprehensive history of the American Revolution that I have found.So, I was pretty much bashing the series because it was not something else. So, here I am years later and I decided to give it a second try. I am glad that I did.Liberty! is much better than I remembered. It is not as good as the book but it the best documentary on the American Revolution I have seen. It is as thorough as one can be in the limited time that this format will allow.As for the actor thing - this time around I really liked it. The actors are really good and the story is paced very well. The build up to the revolution is logical and shows how the logic of both the British and the American positions and how those positions led to the Revolution.Liberty! does a good job of going back and forth from the political to the military action in the actual war. The last episode in the series covers the Articles of Confederation and the writing of the Constitution a little too quickly but it makes a good point about how the original argument about the Constitution are still the same argument we are having today - how much power should our national government have?",1.0,280,0.09122016391533373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309664484334076,0.11186788125274061,0.17560867341951658,0.0,0.03948623686170951,0.05609525171376755,0.0,0.10967092709380587,0.06488361480100291,0.08696651872827685,0.04620883248965841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05188587227566976,0.03148680426093099,0.04219184163946272,0.0,0.16903017667525164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11097172001781984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22179244982398513,0.0,0.0848770022059173,0.054214445066872556,0.15613656886747931,0.25310663873479267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15480453916154185,0.0,0.0,0.07297061393245849,0.15130029231444778,0.06964281246996991,0.03718733162281858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045134562480465865,0.05864089970052432,0.0,0.10039991776008297,0.0,0.1234063305727236,0.0,0.0,0.08331957797475595,0.0,0.04875894747466625,0.10334443624863196,0.1243403703685585,0.7009862204761526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0437378488046434,0.07333170768313467,0.09454861842883154,0.12602213756311811,0.05619901659936936,0.0,0.04770370467748304,0.04610183659799484,0.06749834558055301,0.0,0.0,0.055164061437704845,0.04810819323800187,0.0,0.0,0.04706774808504488,0.0,0.0,0.048697967110154144,0.0,0.0,0.0,

13169,0767817478,A2XVRCU5DQBULH,0,0,1044921600,Oodles of giddy fun...,"People who chided the remake of ""Godzilla"" for not having a plot obviously haven't seen any of the Toho Godzilla movies. They're even more devoid (although they are twice as fun). Roland Emmerich, hot off the success of ""ID4"" gathered up his team of special effects wizards to make what I consider to be the best non-Japanese monster film of all time (excluding flicks like ""Jurassic Park""). The pace of the 2.5 hour movie is surprisingly quick and the dialogue, while often cheesy, is good summer-movie fun. I really don't see why so many people have a problem with this movie. It's got laughs, great special effects, a cool monster, and those baby Godzillas are way cool. I like movies like this, so maybe I'm a little shallow. But at least I'm having fun!",0.0,134,0.0,0.0,0.09131419307065597,0.0,0.0,0.10901537822933828,0.17600419843373022,0.08288669667404339,0.09818266298015181,0.09318684760340003,0.0,0.0,0.1294107615953204,0.0765621138524088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318289141735101,0.0,0.12072204058092645,0.10184561818877232,0.0,0.07430832268107992,0.0,0.0,0.09972708572722243,0.10297931414943513,0.0,0.0,0.08729712412458077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10547966136186514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12282654923814594,0.059732736380508085,0.0,0.0,0.29969994356371593,0.0,0.13454429364833573,0.0,0.10801920577727776,0.0,0.23852327990849292,0.2611074864283974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08610470407531455,0.35706611728119775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27678305242696377,0.0,0.11847104939968814,0.11712084243125744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966327873255087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618815290459583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20644115899589427,0.11537438884166351,0.11156656593405867,0.11896404075048217,0.0,0.0,0.11257993192582386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13380091259036977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757765837458957,0.0,0.0,0.10412243630524634,0.0,0.0782526201467417,0.0,0.0,

It&#8217;s sexy, different, strange, comedic and just all around an interesting film. You definitely have to watch this movie with an open mind and pay attention to possible double or hidden meanings from character portrayals to set designs. The beginning is a bit off as Pitt gets into a motorcycle accident and is thrown into an animated world. As he&#8217;s unable to return to reality he instead becomes a detective and we follow him cracking down on crime as best he can. Basinger plays the sexy Holli who has just about everyone and anyone under her thumb (thanks mainly to her looks). When her plan to cross into the real world so she herself can become real is discovered, we see just how far this deadly vixen will go to get what she wants and the lengths that Pitt will go to stop her.I would really recommend this movie if you&#8217;re in the mood for something outside the ordinary. The acting is pretty good considering the genre, the plot is easy to follow and the concept and design is unique and interesting. &#8230;Just give it a try!",1.0,206,0.06471501165747641,0.0,0.05490015780581964,0.0,0.17860798357436206,0.3277125530431406,0.0,0.1495000691914475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778046762988644,0.0,0.0,0.13112912781091565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061231888739009685,0.0,0.044675843965684935,0.05986495542986525,0.07319941907434961,0.059958179115732986,0.0,0.0,0.06344613657956596,0.052485005115528206,0.1958417626210385,0.31530640117833014,0.08463716751596387,0.0,0.07867394860867333,0.06121017648148036,0.04014328960795526,0.23077058583863228,0.22153829681331644,0.07182534375408373,0.08275408537331731,0.2525683930109623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434055897225691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04940722782560083,0.0,0.0,0.06567896905243432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245494788375967,0.07041569897958011,0.0,0.16761508784468968,0.0,0.05911003914591703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04410586526332464,0.3108162266619964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13873138317624345,0.0,0.3933812931962518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07600473609419099,0.0,0.1565418313577365,0.0,0.0,0.06467812092010305,0.06678325789552376,0.0,0.12520152655483274,0.13819267030276738,0.047047244796335354,0.07033279570889624,0.10324302324523142,

However, if you do like Tracy Morgan's humor (which I do) you will love this movie. I loved this movie for what it was, a silly cop action comedy. I don't understand how anyone could go into a movie with this cast and think that it was going to be anything Oscar worthy. If you like having a good time and don't want to have to think much, then this movie is absolutely worth it. If you're uptight and need movies to speak to you on a deeper level and love being a harsh critic, don't waste your time.

But after buying the series set, buying ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" was a no-brainer. And I remembered even less about it than I thought I did. In fact, except for the first few minutes, which I DID remember, it was just like watching a whole new movie..And it was just as good as I thought I remembered it was. The story answered the questions and wonderings that I had at the end of the series. All the characters just as enjoyable as they ever were, the action was exciting, and the background scenery was still excellent..The only regret I had was that, even though the (almost) happy ending I wanted was there (one of the characters dies), I wanted more. But that is the hallmark of a good story..Anyone who was a fan of ""Farscape,"" or anyone just wanting a good story, wonderful characters, and great sci-fi, shouldn't hesitate to buy this DVD!",1.0,173,0.13281877680087834,0.08361295195329597,0.05633756078526297,0.0,0.0,0.16814638258839892,0.0,0.20455239892665367,0.060575158775408484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14170818132305438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07807051539816118,0.14896228221797655,0.0,0.15109418341535436,0.045845552647626346,0.0,0.0,0.1845840355752978,0.06353451939316158,0.15033466547354346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041194326369838934,0.0,0.037889773490052445,0.2211176523743521,0.0,0.2591811711000753,0.061634682116342904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664395059313968,0.0,0.04905341776076097,0.0,0.07513305776612929,0.0,0.07542571183506021,0.0,0.14686460311905014,0.05070081420715082,0.054145659102473175,0.07486032577184729,0.06739858425165926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26952392715551965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21298263948618623,0.07523600606801994,0.13578195206913066,0.4465356798130029,0.0,0.0,0.08269496101548,0.06450437433680956,0.06368337140378665,0.0711818330300566,0.0,0.036698259337707165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44225654614979987,0.0,0.08255033300629333,0.0,0.0,0.07800416756932065,0.0,0.06853178572700082,0.07567771538064731,0.06423978449787716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

That required him to be pushed decidedly out of his comfort zone. He is slowing starting to move in the direction of those who have come before him in the vein of Jamie Foxx whom a few years ago you couldn't have taken seriously. The action, the lack of gratuitous sex and  the menace are all very real - the ending is a bit too predictable and Ryan Reynolds hops back to safe territory by essentially being offered his dream job come the end of the movie and you can't tell me that the CIA would just let you burn them. I give Ryan A+ for effort, Denzel is of course always a pleasure to watch and this is a good show all around with less of typical action feel and more of a thriller one.",1.0,169,0.0,0.0,0.13626362852505527,0.0,0.0,0.2440173400711119,0.1313211556042919,0.0,0.0,0.06952904887099728,0.0,0.09444900180880024,0.0,0.0,0.07656717645664597,0.08136648178699321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663299209735087,0.0,0.18168287392317284,0.07440888489758496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13026915633819622,0.08101406340176437,0.0,0.3151074973572927,0.15740205229257653,0.0,0.07596263001216151,0.09963669544010452,0.09546310563273526,0.18328795026914102,0.0,0.0,0.07836017021149554,0.07453788654582781,0.0,0.0,0.1829783468870394,0.08059584405579387,0.0,0.05932273781886173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35522133801946276,0.0,0.0654810385411084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07947486136665818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060808948003121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16420786788833389,0.3857270046402314,0.0,0.09747205062916196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04304186549143862,0.0,0.26628618145023913,0.09895762377469491,0.0,0.0,0.08117807886051209,0.0,0.09432287209369235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07768836642318859,0.0,0.058386246454246137,0.08728391985231888,0.3203148572234288,

1265405,B002EOVWVQ,AEGYKCHYY809X,19,43,1262304000,A powerful view of the 1973 coup told from the point of view of the extreme left,"This a rare and interesting documentary about one of the most controversial military coups in history! It was the first time an elected communist government had been overthrown by force and this alone polarised opinion with much of the factual data being lost in the process. Guzm&aacute;n was a recently graduated student from Spain and clearly one holding extreme left wing views, (not unusual for students at that time!) This long documentary tells the story from this point of view. There is hardly a word anywhere that makes any attempt to show why the coup took place from the point of view of the right. I have relatives in Chile who were in Santiago at this time and to make my position clear, we were and remain supporters of the coup, despite strongly condemning the many excesses that took place after the event. The dialogue in this film is full of classic left wing propaganda. I spent time in China during and after the Cultural Revolution and such repetitive extreme political comments, against which it is pointless to argue, were daily fare! Disc 3 is particularly bad in this regard and I found it just too much.Despite this reservation, the factual camera work is very dramatic and the first two discs are excellent value. Disc 4 is a later, (color), documentary about the Battle of Chile. Guzm&aacute;n has both aged and matured and the views expressed a little more moderate.The sub-titles are very good and the sound and picture quality remarkable considering the conditions under which the filming took place.Pinochet will always be controversial, but there are those that feel this was the coup that stopped communism in its tracks in latin America and was the first shot that led in due course to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Allende comes across as a rather decent fellow, somewhat nave perhaps, with strong principles but with no ability to control his extreme left wing. He paid the ultimate price for this shortcoming. Not all the facts claimed in the film are correct: After the coup Pinochet published his side of the story in ""El Libro Blanco"". Even if only half of the facts claimed in that book are true, then Allende had to go. All in all this is well worth buying whichever side of the political platform you support. Just be clear that in no way is it a balanced and objective picture of the coup, but bearing in mind the polarisation of feelings at that time and even up to the present day, such a view would be very hard to get and even harder to publish. Better look at the coup from both sides and make up your own mind. This is a good start.",0.4418604651162791,458,0.06571911750513258,0.12411579627647928,0.08362796736375519,0.0,0.03022987186240743,0.29951755097883725,0.1343244394942242,0.02530328065204823,0.11989105978355336,0.08534299420549415,0.0,0.03864361129134452,0.0,0.07011762074703023,0.03132729989731585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056045648868507,0.062181951112038225,0.11214276286894018,0.04536902588786939,0.12158761744981683,0.0371675836892078,0.06088847885180618,0.0,0.074386030223441,0.03221527740107791,0.026649676250551948,0.033146734378069656,0.0,0.0,0.06440072005808607,0.0,0.031079950985619408,0.32612916221060373,0.0,0.16873173225890092,0.07293977216607427,0.04201904103381639,0.06412179907431237,0.0,0.0,0.041073081193034766,0.0,0.03297562080851684,0.039466035063326944,0.0,0.0,0.07435211151288831,0.03235627418461739,0.07464172368381292,0.0525713191646961,0.2543416164318712,0.0,0.05358285957237869,0.03704110717152759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043402775948864665,0.0,0.0,0.0702562867895819,0.0,0.20155591576826956,0.5681498261192892,0.0,0.0,0.04091770750310621,0.06383390449365758,0.0,0.21132586951073684,0.17029271538690563,0.1634256502104295,0.04048830452656108,0.041503610574461634,0.06873579784485921,0.09964152287858645,0.09725770080237156,0.0,0.040846145143030255,0.03974267618121955,0.034659310712293216,0.11579006774163428,0.0,0.0,0.07489110786010265,0.03178603242408768,0.03508421039172601,0.07166583138610695,0.03571203301423991,0.02621123060345858,
241235,6300987582,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,29,30,1087862400,Gripping Journey Into A Frightening Oversized World,"&quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, is one of the great Sci Fi movie titles from the 1950's thats not as well remembered as other landmark efforts of that time like &quot;The Thing From Another World&quot;. That is unfortunate as here we have a really ground breaking effort that not only boasts stunning special effects, but also restrained performances and an interesting premise that is handled with integrity by director and cast. The film of course will always be talked about for the innovative and at times quite frightening process by which the main character shrinks away to practically nothing. Equally amazing in my mind after a viewing of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, is how this film gives us a view of the &quot;normal&quot;, everyday world suddenly becoming a dangerous and potentially lethal environment where everyday things like the family pet or a spider in the basement take on life threatening personas.The story starts out innocently enough with young couple Scott and Louise Carey (Grant Williams and Randy Stuart), who are spending some time on Scott's brother's boat. While Louise is below getting some refreshments Scott notices a strange mist approaching the boat and before he can take cover it envelopes the whole boat and he is covered in a strange glittery substance. It is just passed off as some unexplained happening and then the story jumps ahead six months to when strange developments start to occur. One morning Scott notices that his shirt seems too big for him and blames it on the cleaners. However it is not long before many other strange things begin to happen that arouse real fears in him. Going to his local doctor (William Schallert), Scott gets a clean bill of health and Louise feels that it is simply a lack of proper diet that is effecting her husband. To be sure however Scott is referred to a specialist Dr. Silver (Raymond Bailey), who gauges that Scott is actually loosing height over a number of weeks of examination and tests. The source of this strange occurance is narrowed down to the now forgotten glittery mist on the boat which further testing reveals to be some sort of radioactive  body that causes the body to shrink. Dr. Silver injects Scott with a serum that will hopefully stop the shrinking process. Meanwhile the media have latched onto the newsworthy story of the &quot;incredible shrinking man&quot; and Scott and Louise become prisoners in their own home as curious busybodies begin making their life a misery. Scott is replaced in his employment which makes it dificult to live and causes further friction between he and Louise. Soon Scott's shrinking begins again and he experiences a rapid and terrifying drop in size. Back at the house Scott is reduced to living in a doll's house and one day when Louise by mistake leaves the door open and the family cat gets inside a new nightmare begins as Scott is hunted by the now &quot;Giant&quot;, cat and after falling into the cellar having to face terrors like a hungry &quot;Giant Spider&quot;. Everything in Scott's existence now holds unknown terrors and after Louise believes that Scott has been eaten by the cat he is now all alone with no assistance from anyone. After facing all of these terrors in his own home Scott does make his escape and now too small to be detected by any human beings begins a new existence where survival is his sole aim.The story of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, may read like your usual sensationalist 1950's science fiction however it is far from that. It presents a quite thought provoking idea that we could all possibly imagine ourselves in. Noticeably absent in this film are the usual 1950's invading aliens or oversized creatures.  Instead here the really frightening elements in the story are the simple household features that we encounter everyday like the family cat, a stray spider in the room or a leak in a water heater. Because of the shrinking of the main character these elements take on quite terrifying proportions.  Director Jack Arnold wisely stays away from the more sensational potential of this story and in his direction even makes the scene where Scott's wedding ring rolls off his finger a seemingly frightening occurence. The performances here are first class and Grant Williams does a sterling job as the young husband who finds himself fighting for survival in his own home. His fear mixed with developing personal strength intent on survival makes for a great performance. Randy Stuart as wife Louise also deserves special mention as she delivers a well thought out performance as the first disbelieving wife who has to take over the leader role in the household as her husband literally shrinks before her eyes. The cast also features supporting performances from future comedy series regulars in Raymond Bailey and William Schallert who will always be rembered for their work in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, and &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, respectively. &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, contains many memorable scenes that boast special effects achievements that even today still cause amazement. Foremost among them of course are Scott's ongoing battle with the ferocious spider in the celler and his terrifying flight from the clutches of the family cat which is now 10 times his size. Those scenes present images that have rightly gone down into Science Fiction folklore.Despite the films almost surreal ending which plays almost like a sermon delivered by Grant Williams the rest of the film dates amazing well despite the passage of over 47 years. Even the introduction of computer technology to achieve incredible special effects in my belief has not dulled the sheer genius evident throughtout this gripping sci fi tale. It certainly is one of my favourites of these efforts in the 1950's and deserves to be better remembered. For a thrilling piece of sci fi action from the golden era of these movies in the 1950's  you can't get better than Jack Arnold's &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;.",0.9666666666666667,998,0.014242810654447956,0.0717298244488801,0.03624812230582053,0.04973734778881914,0.013102986083489844,0.20916149739217205,0.05822225345103489,0.12064337862079984,0.025983088764466294,0.07398298414811011,0.01751704918036192,0.016749879168225956,0.0,0.01013071014698626,0.09505062526209693,0.028859568913915373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04792187440784462,0.053904908613158546,0.03240514477255887,0.05899492900955695,0.1054030838516933,0.016110102419661727,0.0,0.027252475938542683,0.0,0.0418906504185697,0.03465350484744165,0.0718364274327415,0.05204568370342952,0.03725476115615907,0.1674850113547175,0.017314964870931145,0.0,0.2120385703245302,0.033859446976662926,0.17065048382012457,0.07113460003879017,0.0,0.013896635830002764,0.0793126810778781,0.0,0.03560584138285022,0.0,0.014293117169502437,0.0,0.010520478473724849,0.01727489047202567,0.0,0.04207399346093622,0.016176540064877523,0.04557354834588825,0.20473717796404814,0.06524277191873841,0.04645044256132387,0.016055281808492916,0.043364889979978755,0.033110772725651896,0.028188637239340317,0.0,0.6442121875743736,0.031352213304642725,0.0,0.01926825083913338,0.018444792775717398,0.01881271517892273,0.0,0.058278256631849205,0.09135670362132835,0.016135853900088308,0.1747267981404117,0.4446391584181203,0.04923314105921311,0.017285996030140624,0.017735574746125023,0.0,0.0,0.03816589018145968,0.02952500877265211,0.13380138439209996,0.03509890436653539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051678789969077835,0.04506871229824279,0.0,0.0,0.029396001722985808,0.0811529361201462,0.06888748030389592,0.045621224192288624,0.06212638912847226,0.0,0.011361126219504584,

So what happens when Zombies take over the world, the survivors in City...? your guess is as good as mine.  Take refuge in an empty ware house. In fact thats where 97% of this film takes place. The other3% takes place in the woods surrounding the Ware house.This movie looks like its shot on lowgrade video tape. The acting is so bad, its almost like the actors are reading off Cue Cards. Honestly it looks like someones Video Class homework.Now, if Zombies take over the world and you have to defend yourself with the only practical kind of weapon-guns wouldn't you get the best stuff? Yeah not these guys, about 95% of guns being used, look like cap guns, or something smaller than a 38 snub nose revolver.There is some gore in this film but, because of the video quality the picture was shot on, and the bad acting coupled with bad directing the gory parts of this movie seem very fake. Example, in one part of the film a zombie gets his leg blasted off just below the knee, when the zombie is rolling around on the ground with No leg, you can see the actor has his lower leg in a hole with the latex and prosthetics around his knee. So lame.When this movie finally ended, I honestly said 'theres an hour and a half of my life I'm never getting back.'  I think I'm just a bit less intelligent because I watched it.  How about that!

1408462,B004HHX9OQ,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,2,2,1367798400,Cheap Naught Humorous,"I picked up this set because it looks kind of interesting. It wasn't quite what I was expecting though. I was thinking this was going to be a series of spy type movies, done very badly, with skimpy outfits on the women. What I wasn't expecting was all the toplessness. I don't think you get 5 min. into the first movie before a woman has taken off her top and is running around exposed. I'm not exactly complaining, but don't expect their parents to be very happy if you put this on for your teenage nephew or something.The movies range from completely inexplicable and mostly boring to mostly inexplicable and fairly entertaining. Sometimes there's a mix of those in between. I swear at times I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on plot wise, but I still had a mostly enjoyable time. If you picture bad movies run on cable TV on a weekend you get the idea, except with the aforementioned skin.  Actually, some of the gunfights, deaths, etc. were actually so badly done that they were incredibly amusing. The movies date from the 80s to the late 90s and sort of have a unifying theme. Expect to see things like VHS tapes and pagers.Considering you get 12 movies for so cheap, I don't think there's any way I could not recommend purchasing this set. Just don't expect blockbuster quality fair.  Even if you get a few laughs out of it, it's well worth it. Heck, I spent about the same for this as I did forStarhunterwhich had about 1/1000 the toplessness, fewer funny bits, and was equally inexplicable.",1.0,272,0.11344638615460831,0.0,0.048120400065387404,0.0,0.0,0.1723455063425749,0.0,0.04367931062991686,0.05173991975633265,0.09821448860722401,0.06976312378989595,0.0,0.0,0.08069281290322383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778827639776177,0.0,0.06361763373377399,0.0,0.06452810924147945,0.1174761369079176,0.10494416483722141,0.2566393592433912,0.0,0.0,0.128407480647892,0.0556110145550126,0.046003500618816036,0.0,0.0690921063539749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609535362783368,0.035185894414145866,0.06742404975201279,0.032363329780603016,0.1573886312178371,0.0,0.05534452268127708,0.05264490545918751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04189869164232365,0.3439935316868024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907502474321797,0.18816532058790436,0.21652902870505306,0.0,0.0,0.05756810896361963,0.0,0.11226362208317663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617198882700133,0.07673743189647515,0.0,0.0,0.10362078526778734,0.0580245164269017,0.0,0.0,0.0386591216952071,0.35416257990910766,0.06535837702866516,0.0,0.0,0.11019207277666648,0.054394781505422984,0.15199887229098563,0.058792917137363905,0.15672802446709308,0.0,0.0,0.059326936825832996,0.11466953210009789,0.25183390542805517,0.0,0.07050988708820521,0.0,0.0598299809277306,0.13325361261239088,0.17007257420795288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08247452583219668,0.0,0.27147985257670726,

If you are a fan of The Wraith, The People Under the Stairs, Star Man, The Monster Squad, The Adventures of Remo Williams, Tremors, Krull, Dragonslayer or Ladyhawke and somehow missed out on this treasure buy it now and thank me later.  It was directed by Michael Nesmith from The Monkees.  You know the heir to the liquid paper fortune!  See?  Now not only have you found a great movie but you learned something as well.",0.5,131,0.11042838016956615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22368081511181326,0.09028258950296233,0.2551038785781065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854614785247534,0.10527904555251001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07623395183718426,0.10215234282940226,0.0,0.0,0.10564792464482814,0.0,0.0,0.08955934565499829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444780068215063,0.06849969323264653,0.0,0.12600948186026634,0.24512261259770363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12579663119712386,0.0,0.0,0.08156812757314956,0.0,0.0,0.10873703367214563,0.0,0.08833602517990702,0.24421276294385616,0.08430748906184427,0.09003572494668687,0.12448096139816965,0.11207325747007699,0.0,0.1092770810849663,0.14197781033643533,0.0,0.0,0.12015591711516704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07526135176772994,0.47733344096619884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726064105445228,0.0,0.17754630877516908,0.11445770685149134,0.12204688015704894,0.0,0.0,0.11549733325432679,0.0,0.08171146210068497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23295331313317277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16056092400317612,0.0,0.35234359165761314,

I was so excited to hear they were going to make a film about it and now it is finally here ! The film is about as perfect as a films like this can be. Superb editing and in a tight package that is well under 90 minutes-about 73 minutes to be exact. The only part of this project that is disturbing to me is the obviousness of this substance and the almost complete disinterest by nearly everyone in western society but I don't blame the film for that for the most part. I do recommend reading the book though first. In the book there is a greater emphasis on the entities encountered by the volunteers and the similarities of these entities I find most fascinating. It makes perfect sense in the film to not emphasize that aspect of it for obvious reasons.,0.9333333333333333,154,0.24717992799948182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20861714356288677,0.0,0.1268928195662497,0.0,0.1426615164238878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05860519774898184,0.15710253022254295,0.08347493505445534,0.09780360698225708,0.10090969534965423,0.0,0.0,0.31183478582246676,0.0937303451547844,0.17064003562577298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204437171135813,0.0,0.282056248635047,0.2286149540238524,0.0,0.0,0.07646939012058843,0.0,0.0,0.09385993647084817,0.0,0.19791727938964507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590966413465357,0.18221310218842102,0.06290387502477371,0.0,0.09287828312630869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07525721799792215,0.08428354737282336,0.0,0.0,0.22461732491261804,0.4748668388349561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08002978187402777,0.07901117365833245,0.13247163380836202,0.0,0.2276553892777802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060966915955741094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690607595481105,0.09677880887956242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
909224,B0009NZ6NY,A2NJO6YE954DBH,19,20,1124150400,Guess Who Mrs. Delafield Brought Home to Dinner and Wants to Marry,"""Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry"" was the first of a series of made for television movies that Katharine Hepburn made at the end of her acting career when she was in her 80s. Hepburn had won her fourth Oscar for ""On Golden Pond"" in 1981 and then did nothing for three years until she made ""The Ultimate Solution of Grace Quigley"" in 1984. Then in 1986 she made this particular movie for the small screen in which Hepburn plays Margaret Delafield, a wealthy widow from Ashmore who is brought back from death's door by Dr. Marvin Elias (Harold Gould). Her gratitude turns into love and the good doctor responds in kind. The problem is that her children absolutely put their collective feet down to their mother marrying Elias, and they object as much to him being an outsider as they do to him being Jewish. His children are equally outraged, not just because Margaret is a Christian but also because she is from a different clash. Basically, you have the two sets of children trying to out do the others in terms of which is being more prejudiced (I vote for his children, since they want to blame Margaret for the Holocaust and since WASP protecting their family money is so stereotypical with regards to anybody marrying into their money that it is old hat).It is hard for a fan of Hepburn's to watch this movie and not think of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"", since both have to do with a marriage and the question of prejudice. I assume that topic is one of the reasons that Hepburn was persuaded to do this script. The supporting cast consists of Bibi Besch, Denholm Elliot, Brenda Forbes, Charles Frank, Suzanne Lederer and John Pleshette, but they all have the thankless task of being bigots pretty much from start to finish. However, they do their jobs so well, especially Besch, that you would not be surprised if they succeeded in keeping Margaret and Marvin apart. There is a noticeable age difference between Hepburn and Gould that is slightly problematic; the film suggests it is on the order of five years but you can tack on another decade in the real world. But when Hepburn talks about how Gould's character has reawakened the 14-year-old girl buried deep inside her, you buy her feelings for him. When he take a photograph of her saying he takes shots of all of his patients that he saves, she asks, ""Don't you save all of your patients?"" ""No,"" he assures her with a gleam in his eye, ""I'm very selective."" So you have to root for him. Besides, Harold Gould is one of the most beloved character actors of our time, from playing Rhoda's father to the grandpa in the ""Freaky Friday"" remake, so seeing him doing kissing scenes with Katharine Hepburn is a treat.But questions of age are not even secondary given the religious and class distinctions that threaten the happiness of Mrs. Delafield and Dr. Elias. There is something to be said for Margaret's rejoinder to the question of ""religious differences,"" even though the simplicity of that position will probably be considered offensive by some. For that matter, her solution to the concern of her children for the family money is eminently practical and rather obvious as well. Then again, it is not like bigots are the most rational people on the face of the earth. If there is a fault with this television movie it is that the come back to the onslaught of prejudice seems less in comparison, but that is because it is. The bigotry here is laid on so thick that you feel sorry for these characters that they do not hear the filth that comes spewing out of their mouths. The happy note on which it ends does try to make the best of the situation, and while it might not work in the real world, the sentiments it represents are certainly to be appreciated.All things considered I think ""Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry"" is the best of these latter television movies by Hepburn. She followed this effort with ""Laura Lansing Slept Here"" in 1988, which was also written by James Prideaux, who would do ""The Man Upstairs"" for Hepburn as well in 1992. All three of these movies were directed by George Schaefer, so Hepburn must have had a high degree of comfort with the pair to keep working with them at this point in her life. In 1994 Hepburn ended her distinguished acting career by doing ""This Can't Be Love"" with Anthony Quinn and ""One Christmas"" with Henry Winkler, which her last theatrical film, ""Love Affair,"" done in between. That is the one I remember best because of the way she upstaged not only Warren Beatty but a luminous Annette Benning. Besides, with the release of ""Mrs. Delafield"" and ""Laura Lansing"" on DVD this month, I now have everything Katharine Hepburn did on either video or DVD.",0.95,829,0.018897168826819872,0.0,0.08015586523932666,0.04399389422808187,0.01738486497943099,0.14354102586665324,0.06179879966871591,0.05820654744084979,0.034474011270452944,0.0817996868547715,0.09296553713732877,0.0,0.06815828658044527,0.09408902585275411,0.10809590223151007,0.03829048628580813,0.15702098891059646,0.023143961138576433,0.04443081755187903,0.04238806385217177,0.0357601523804234,0.021497354225984384,0.18263857519119306,0.08740461761452191,0.0,0.01750814539438955,0.0,0.04277858330582445,0.018526649747037747,0.09195560447033234,0.07624928141205999,0.3222497145443129,0.12357278493885798,0.07407228372543938,0.022973261551732918,0.035747472163403134,0.21099743364043225,0.04492425697598766,0.2587620083355865,0.09438042665697625,0.0,0.01843786874484535,0.017538499022409382,0.06533721797125382,0.0,0.0,0.018963914831603458,0.0453929605770276,0.041875286278867205,0.06876027414141257,0.04275907703051112,0.0,0.02146281489351546,0.12093273694690816,0.3447770480958296,0.11541763823543005,0.06162981987601652,0.02130193107654004,0.019178650127183304,0.0,0.03740030320093041,0.02429609713979354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0255648549951695,0.17130611370215137,0.0,0.10356290083164461,0.019330700962468753,0.0,0.0,0.21894598074512345,0.3993448329718489,0.13064373332521115,0.022934826084996952,0.07059396316138092,0.05506525875050897,0.12685025640280245,0.0810207802583881,0.01958669145179934,0.22973936094419248,0.0,0.023868267430308544,0.0,0.01910091260584388,0.055931828105488864,0.022193835600489875,0.02349016633196113,0.0,0.05979655882326109,0.022196529124235267,0.0,0.05850332713851713,0.10767261967184884,0.054839387124074886,0.02017654138086488,0.15111883247499908,0.04107519045527969,0.105516521850284,
981840,B000F3T3BO,A1K548TDR33DMN,1,2,1302307200,Delights of Diva Dessay.,"This presentation of Natalie Dessay achieves one thing among many others - it convinces the viewer and the listener that the actress we see is perhaps the most gifted and unique in today's world of the opera; and perhaps not only today's.  Her extraordinary gifts include not only flawless, superb singing with astonishing sound in the upper range - divinely effortless, beautiful, thrilling; but also her acting - her incredible dynamism on stage, her dancing and again, simply acting her role to such an extent that one forgets it is an opera!  So captivating is the impression Dessay is making...Of all the marvelous, outstanding numbers on the DVD, with each one competing in perfection with another, I would particularly note the three representations of Olympia, her most famous aria Les oiseaux dans la charmille from Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann.  I personally has never been an admirer of this opera, but seeing Natalie Dessay performing this role made literally fall in love with this aria.  In two tracks on the disk, she is playing a doll - and I can argue without much risk that she is the absolute greatest performer of Olympia; in the 3rd track at Wiener Staatsoper/1996 production she is phenomenally mechanical, a true doll in bodily movements while she sings as a nightingale!  The next doll is at track 10, in Choregies d'Orange/2000 production, which seems to be particularly rich, funny and opulent; here she outperforms herself, I think - the impression of a doll singing is so true that one can't believe her own eyes!And the third representation of Olympia is track 7, where she is rather playing a young maiden, confined to a strange, sinister bizarre place, populated with Boy George,Marlon Brando and other silent characters who seem to be watching over her; it is Opera de Lyon/1993 production conducted by Kent Nagano, and the mastery of this conductor is heard through playing this piece in a very unusual manner - together Dessay and Nagano managed to give it a flair of a lament of a young girl who is not free to follow her lover.  It is an amazing production, as two others above, and one can only wish to be there, alas, to see and hear it live.Another great piece is Lucia's Mad Scene, which is excellent; the dramatism of acting, coupled with incomparable singing, is astonishing.In Konigin der Nacht aria, Der Holle Rache from Die Zauberflote, Dessay is more virtuosic than Edita Gruberova; it seems to me that the only singer who is her equal in dazzling singing is Joan Sutherland in her best years (1950s);  but any other big name Dessay beats.  Now add to this amazing beauty of her voice with her phenomenal control over it her ability to dance and act, and you get a true phenomenon on stage.This extraordinary performance is concluded with Duo da la mouche by Eurydice and Jupiter from Offenbach's Orphee aux enfers/1997;  it is another masterpiece - excellent singing accompanied by the most suggestive yet hilarious acting - nothing from the modern fashion (mostly German, though) of depicting explicit heavy-duty sex on stage; no, here it is full of mischief and although quite graphic, very elegant!  Such a result is much more difficult to achieve - to make the audience smile with delight and fun.  This is another production one can only regret to have never seen.The only point of not even negative, but somewhat bizarre on this DVD is actually Natalie's comments to her pieces.  I am not sure what was the point of including them - she continues to act when commenting, and the whole impression is very insincere while providing no valuable information.  Not that I would expect any sincerity from an actress of her magnitude, but it is really hard to believe her words about Lucia's spectacle, that she was so overcome with the role that she forgot to notice she was baring herself with losing the dress.  One cannot sing belcanto and lose self-control; her talking only convinced me that at every moment she is in full and total control of her acting, and whatever she is making on stage is deliberate, as it should be.However her comments are somewhat amusing, demonstrating once more some cultural stereotypes characteristic of a nation - if Germans can't do an opera without a gun and a suitcase, French just can't stop from sexualising everything and delving into the war of the sexes.  Dessay's comments on Konigin der Nacht aria, her words ""why should women have less power than men"" obscure the fact that in Mozart's Austria there was at the time of Die Zauberflote a recent Empress, as powerful as any man can only dream to be, while indeed the daughter of that Empress met a very deplorable fate in France soon thereafter.  No doubt French are obsessed to this day about what a girl should do, and Natalie plays into the game.Overall, Dessay's art presented on this DVD beats any expectations, no matter how high.  I expected a lot, of course, after listening to her other DVD ""Le Rossignol"" on Stravinsky's music; predictably, she sang the nightingale and I was struck then by the beauty of her voice.  But in that DVD she does not get to act too much; here her overall talent is given an opportunity to show itself in full glory, and it shines!  Certainly she is not as conventionally beautiful as Anna Netrebko, for example, but as an overall opera actress of today she is so much more superior to Anna Netrebko, Renee Fleming and just about any soprano since she sings better or just as well and can act as no one else can.  Natalie Dessay is a tremendous, genius and genuine actress and singer.A must to see and hear.",0.5,964,0.04841257784196612,0.02031800343563444,0.013690065077831699,0.018784628960445384,0.11876856782825083,0.25333003961370965,0.026387014433396687,0.12426592552552454,0.058879216932818036,0.06985409196472939,0.0,0.018978108763058048,0.01940160328242577,0.08034876070441464,0.06154009781558508,0.14714435518675373,0.03831156335852245,0.0,0.09485593816659056,0.01809896727229164,0.0,0.0,0.011140500059408713,0.08956860983333712,0.036506445549090716,0.0,0.015438930849286365,0.0,0.015821115519984594,0.026175630976628794,0.0,0.4717543982502734,0.0,0.0,0.019618367586341487,0.015263549923133392,0.17017423219354097,0.03836375539944656,0.3314606538655305,0.11641876548165836,0.0,0.0472358988814726,0.0,0.018598571740201818,0.02017123597063817,0.03676675138967156,0.0647780988702331,0.05814601799751375,0.0,0.0,0.07302953382986066,0.0,0.09164249296304842,0.1032723577931764,0.2319732812529183,0.12320331876642304,0.10525945198377841,0.14552887519863714,0.01637790120299812,0.05627322797722055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01776149272726737,0.05267719839391453,0.0,0.3552744326211172,0.02131536300699434,0.05895941396183038,0.01650774733615265,0.0,0.03656479992782229,0.13198042189342873,0.27127117463935896,0.0,0.019585545032474644,0.02009493102169976,0.03134921250288625,0.0,0.10378339917006857,0.016726354324410966,0.22294254116330875,0.019884048650209818,0.040765343052612736,0.0,0.06524606423727632,0.05970479861330224,0.0,0.0,0.019517866107692624,0.01702139490513538,0.0,0.03225665352875243,0.016653269921975015,0.0367794712466038,0.046830932229064766,0.0,0.1290502351195169,0.03507678625501381,0.012872492207203478,

684548,B00005UM44,A2SCZV2FHKQ62O,13,13,1014163200,naughty-Sexy fun,"I passed over this anime because it looked and read like another nerd cast adrift in a timeline of wild girls. When I bought it, I was shocked because it was actually pretty good. (The worst thing is it only has two episodes.)Yes it is another guy and bunch of gals video, but it cuts right to the bone: the main male lead already knows three of the fem's and the first thing to happen is he gets a sword from the princess, which is a marraige proposal. None of the slow ...of introducing girls one-episode-at-a-time and having them fight over the lead.Rather, this is more conventional. We meet a whole bevy of ladies in the first episode and they aren't so plastic as some are. They don't all fight for Mr. Nerd. He isn't just another clueless highschool kid. The dirty old man is a muscled samurai who's kinky and gets his thrills various ways. Yet he's also competent. The princesse's retainer lusts for her unwanted father-chosen fiance and she gets her guy!Keep in mind that I'm male, and I like offbeat anime. This gave me lots of nice bikini grade shots of the ladies. The lead male is a clumsy but earnest knucklehead who you can see why the princess loves. (She's no super-lady herself). It gives slapstick and situational humor and diverges from the same-ole plot lines of others while maintaining the general mysterious strangers plot. It takes place in modern day and has swords and tanks mixed up and killer manikins. Blood spurts in humor during the first few minutes; after that deaths are avoided. . There is profanity and sexual inuendo enough to make it a much older young persons anime - but it's not trashy like some ribald sex movies. The people are quiet believably human, cheering at one moment and booing at another.In the end, this is good general audience fair, a must-see for older normal people. People with a twisted lech for violence or pornography or pure goddy-two-shoes or robot mechas will find it boring or insulting, but for a normal person of mature mind who likes what is sometimes outrageous comedy and sometimes cutting human-interest satyr, it's a decent watch.",1.0,369,0.0,0.05836271615110478,0.03932420745762586,0.05395815447592296,0.0,0.3755773953996352,0.11369358989898322,0.03569492918768203,0.12684628570674125,0.0,0.11402147733926227,0.0,0.0,0.13188505958528823,0.0,0.04696297088992492,0.0,0.05677176127331489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15819798367504617,0.16000337946796253,0.08576084371531618,0.0,0.08589439333373418,0.0,0.0,0.09089114264714336,0.0,0.1402786878940531,0.1129247604033271,0.0,0.04542452762786387,0.0,0.0,0.17252442743333435,0.0,0.2644745871984987,0.30868487429391045,0.0,0.0452277929652391,0.1290649608721737,0.0,0.0,0.052805569256628944,0.04651817548348549,0.0,0.0,0.05622261238789353,0.05244366119759165,0.0,0.052647936802703896,0.03708075527224093,0.25628257776586916,0.0,0.07558847425401911,0.052253291409230435,0.18817967072197606,0.0,0.0,0.17879379658928202,0.0,0.0,0.10087554082233302,0.0,0.12006031951212445,0.0,0.04233968598822544,0.09483579182630938,0.0,0.0,0.06318481640244815,0.4230032172439149,0.0,0.05625875637909623,0.0,0.04502472884854801,0.08890332040568678,0.09937132990039745,0.04804583643126641,0.07684730808795963,0.0,0.11709694571708579,0.04848223972357654,0.0,0.06859993355874196,0.05444111873961214,0.0,0.056064351161626017,0.0,0.0,0.04632802430236241,0.04783590417842696,0.05282383791678473,0.13452012710968356,0.04949272873978203,0.03369927680762846,0.0,0.03697575951427956,
1355831,B003NOGNQU,A2M1N8G4W4END8,14,17,1276300800,Boris Karloff's THRILLER on DVD...Finally!,"Horror fans have been waiting a long time for this one to get an official DVD release, and with good reason! THRILLER (a.k.a. Boris Karloff's THRILLER) is an hour-long TV Horror anthology series that originally aired on NBC from 1960 to 1962, and Horror fans who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s are nearly enraptured with the content and structure of this show. Indeed, in his non-fiction book on horror, DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King calls THRILLER ""the best horror series ever put on TV"" (p. 224, 1983 edition). At the beginning of each hour, Hollywood's master of the macabre himself, Boris Karloff, sets the tone and primes viewers for frightful and chilling dramatizations based on the works of some of the era's greatest writers in the genre--writers like Robert E. Howard, Cornell Woolrich, Richard Matheson, and Robert Bloch. Each episode--many of which feature famous guest stars such as William Shatner, Elizabeth Montgomery, Leslie Nielsen, John Carradine, Tom Poston, Edward Andrews, Boris Karloff himself, and many others--is shot in eerie black and white and offers at least one story, with a few episodes dividing the hour between two or three shorter plays.As with any Horror program, of course, there are a few clunker episodes that do not quite measure up to the rest, and Horror fans who are purists will probably be annoyed by the handful of episodes that are crime-based ""thrillers""--most of which were produced and broadcast at the beginning of the series' original run--rather than stories of the ghastly or macabre. When compared with today's graphically gory product, THRILLER might seem a little tame to modern audiences. But overall, the show has stood the test of time and can still inspire chills and goose bumps.  Serious genre fans will definitely want this set of DVDs in their collections!",0.8235294117647058,300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020143007223751,0.3930724101015052,0.18131752363752157,0.08538893229351373,0.15171999424549062,0.048000015321786514,0.0,0.06520373293702482,0.06665874744273245,0.03943670949815346,0.05285885112399385,0.05617209548920898,0.06581416981052429,0.0,0.06517995377647623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07655158896260278,0.0512889858874468,0.06271321752292955,0.051368854790288423,0.0,0.0,0.05435714401315651,0.04496625224797162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054331973789417565,0.0,0.0,0.1719627618022885,0.0,0.06326725709667702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05145791225896862,0.0,0.13860600122593753,0.0,0.0,0.06659141639096261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04435204346092928,0.39849924110413226,0.16931753093202387,0.09041086867422335,0.0,0.11254022299503251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22502166181504282,0.0,0.1464678334723427,0.0,0.05671622826788665,0.05927205051357323,0.06281346258354185,0.1133624046723547,0.45269328628509126,0.06388473112819884,0.0,0.0,0.05385377714251383,0.0,0.0891430374763457,0.1149346074464382,0.12255540187532715,0.0,0.07002943693374782,0.11597856556675841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06512456092560366,0.0,0.057216205159195066,0.1263644787091055,0.10726574976040312,0.11839584387916044,0.201537398389067,0.0,0.0,
1035120,B000KLQUT4,A16XRPF40679KG,5,9,1294531200,the best secret agent tv show ever.,"This was the most intelligent secret agent show ever. Dangerman ran 29 half and hour episodes and then several seasons as a hour show. Unfortunately it's not in color though. I wish they'd give us a choice of colorized episodes but that's a minor thing and it didn't make the show any less great. This is a show based on well scripted and acted stories so that helps alot. It's so good that even several young people I showed it to were hooked! In spite of the black and white, few youngster can even watch black and white anymore. So that's how good this show really is. Some people think that this is the same character who is the prisoner. That may be the case but probably isn't.  That show is another classic that Patrick M. was involved with, this one however is close in excellence to that one.",0.5555555555555556,149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2177760934954603,0.0,0.055193255904509644,0.0,0.062052002710824145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196358431471948,0.0,0.0726164564365672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16077471407264454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328141374676658,0.06857268858321601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871358401784303,0.0,0.13338287944262175,0.0,0.2453661722325026,0.1591012472310736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608602982120543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05733608838701809,0.07925534646181807,0.054721294451416824,0.11687861827649242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18430651064197487,0.0,0.07888844904155129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5680387186594806,0.19640311748855946,0.07331988389239615,0.0,0.0,0.439647624789926,0.20654791221420954,0.0,0.0,0.0892525175806405,0.0,0.06873334428136357,0.1920660499116769,0.0,0.07921672606156681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10607259277731254,0.08417953660936604,0.0,0.0,0.07560127210076466,0.08418975294082019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933387989868028,0.0,0.05210747999696838,0.0,0.0,

287125,6301978013,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,5,5,1274486400,She really was unsinkable,"This film version of the successful Broadway musical could have been a lot better if it had kept more of the songs from the original--and if Tammy Grimes, as well as Harve Presnell, had been brought in to recreate her stage role.  Still, it's a lively and engaging story about a young woman determined to better herself.  Molly Tobin (Debbie Reynolds) was plucked from a swollen river at the age of six months and raised by hard-drinking Shamus Tobin (Ed Begley) as his own.  At 15 she makes up her mind to seek out a better place in life for both of them--which, in the 1880's, means finding a rich husband.  After three days' walk she meets J. J. ""Johnny"" Brown (Presnell), an easygoing young miner who loves the beautiful Colorado countryside and, though he owns a good mine for which he's been offered six figures, takes only enough out of it to live comfortably.  To Molly that's sacrilege, but Johnny has already made up his mind to win her.  In Leadville she finds a job in Christmas Morgan's (Jack Kruschen) saloon as a piano player and dancer--and persuades Johnny to teach her to read and write.  He does--and wins her at last by promising he'll ""never say no"" to her.  But even after he finds the Little Johnny--""the richest mine in the United States""--Molly longs for acceptance by Denver society, and eventually her fixation leads to trouble for the marriage.The original show boasted 18 musical numbers, while this version has only 10, four of which are reprises; but it does have a couple of very lively ensemble dance numbers, and follows the stage script closely.  What makes it work is Molly's hunger to better herself and the way she is progressively seduced by the longing to ""belong.""  (Like another of Reynolds's characters, Lilith Prescott inHow the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition), Molly is one of those people who can't ""live on love alone"" no matter how much she cares for the man in her life; but unlike Lilith she doesn't know where she has to stop.)  Though it may disappoint those who own the original cast albumThe Unsinkable Molly Brown (1960 Original Broadway Cast), it's still an enjoyable movie.",1.0,371,0.04148524736153632,0.10446426560940278,0.0,0.0,0.07633052661253861,0.23108641374083896,0.03391696547770841,0.12778173496643383,0.11352199619469196,0.0,0.0,0.14636286982148977,0.0,0.118031483136933,0.1582030720735324,0.042029848749242114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046527586491903854,0.03925240814599189,0.0,0.14319617585881408,0.0767522842285818,0.0,0.03843590271031221,0.0,0.09391248638788126,0.12201552326382219,0.0672905208304213,0.2092390353224031,0.4042513077735854,0.0,0.081306015762068,0.05043355684171537,0.07847697921519706,0.1801356408114922,0.0,0.071008030501468,0.16115152059042487,0.0,0.0,0.038502538499951534,0.04781193546843466,0.0,0.0,0.0416317758994468,0.0,0.030643154812136326,0.0,0.046934831979808724,0.0,0.09423529980519253,0.0,0.20642574349121046,0.031672266067745286,0.033824224488787275,0.09352891833558098,0.0,0.0,0.08210546478713777,0.053337598293229115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37607096420660857,0.05479607653816615,0.0,0.0,0.044349339230570384,0.0,0.028273853062533258,0.3387203234391511,0.0,0.050349178866389524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04446654339132486,0.0,0.2980252226292571,0.0,0.0,0.08677905864952733,0.04193252923474417,0.06139400419193949,0.0,0.051568325910386306,0.0,0.04375743719223056,0.0,0.041461598731549455,0.0,0.14182522161134675,0.12038975578015997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

Futurama at it's greatest!,"If you like Futurama, Simpsons, Family Guy, Cleveland Show, Big Bang Theory, or other cartoon/nerdy shows, this movie (and the series in general) is a must see!This is the 1st or 4 full length movies made during the time frame after Futurama was originally cancelled but before it was revived on Comedy Central.There are some connections between the series and the other movies, but you can watch it individually and enjoy it.  It might take a little while to get to know the characters, but even if you are not familiar with the characters, the jokes are still really good.This is my favorite of the movies and of the series in general.  It has all the classic elements of Futurama that I love and takes it to a new level.

34484,0780625765,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,2,2,1191628800,"The Film That  Started It All, More or Less","""The Gay Divorcee,"" (1934) was the first RKO studio pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers as stars, after they unexpectedly stole the previous year's ""Flying Down to Rio.""  It received five Academy Award nominations: one for Best Picture, and won one, the first ever awarded in that category, for best original song,""The Continental."" It set the look and sound of the Astaire-Rogers pictures for this studio, and brought together most of the onscreen, and offscreen, talent that would make them. And it was a great hit: nobody ever invented a better way for depression era audiences to forget their cares.It was based on a stage play in which Astaire starred, ""The Gay Divorce.""  Screenwriter Dwight Taylor, producer Pandro S. Berman, director Mark Sandrich, cinematographer David Abel, Oscar-nominated art directors Carroll Clark and Van Nest Polglase, and costumier Walter Plunkett gave us a magically elegant looking film, all creamy black and white art deco.  The romantic comedy plot was silly, and forgettable,(all mistaken identities, something to do with divorce), just as all future Astaire/Rogers movie plots for this studio would be.  The acting company established here would show up in future films, too: Edward Everett Horton as Astaire's befuddled best friend, lawyer Egbert (Pinky) Fitzgerald; Erik Rhodes as the ethnic Italian, (co-respondent Rodolo Tonetti); Eric Blore as the funny working class bloke, sometimes a valet, here a waiter.  Only one member of the usual company is missing here, the priceless rubber faced Helen Broderick, always Marge, or Madge, Rogers' female sidekick.  That part is here played by Alice Brady, as Rogers' ditsy Aunt Hortense.  There are fewer dance numbers, and great songs by brand name composers, than future movies would boast.  Horton's character gets to dance; Blore's seems to get more lines than usual; Rhodes' actually gets to sing, and play his concertina.  A very young Betty Grable is given a novelty song and dance number. A repeated gag, ""Chance is the fool's name for fate,"" is funny enough.The movie kept only one song from the stage play on which it was based, Cole Porter's everlasting ""Night and Day.""  When first written, it was considered unsingable, but, as Astaire does it, it's unforgettable, imbued with love and longing.  The Astaire/Rogers dance to it wins many votes as most romantic and sexy movie dance ever: Rogers could actually act, while, to quote the feminist Gloria Steinem, dancing backwards and in heels.  The duo concludes, wrung out; Astaire offers Rogers a cigarette, perhaps the second sexiest in cinema, after that shared by Bette Davis and Paul Henreid in ""Now Voyager.""Then there's ""The Continental,"" seventeen minutes( the movie's only 105!) of sheer black and white musical bliss.  Lots of dancing up and down staircases, revolving doors, and chorus boys and girls.  That cute bit with the cutout dancers on the revolving record player turntable.  And a brief instrumental reprise a bit later, to wrap things up.  What a way to go.",1.0,488,0.0,0.09954983201455803,0.10061350391173099,0.0,0.0,0.460449854045645,0.03232137033704974,0.24354070123845842,0.0,0.034225622328728375,0.0,0.0,0.1425897741648556,0.028119697798491022,0.11307040611375531,0.0,0.04692771251661267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037405811588347035,0.13491989182887373,0.16375155851099713,0.03657076875578588,0.04471662943376098,0.0,0.07564438983385986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03874052128577037,0.0,0.0,0.1471382665341487,0.0,0.1127791956236419,0.19744750635298386,0.0,0.03857273520668325,0.0,0.045562663140429366,0.04941536600198774,0.0,0.039673243985210334,0.09496383084268363,0.11680629337309736,0.047949718482460164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13114307856472457,0.09054681277385918,0.1289319690800906,0.13369339344648123,0.04012247853669536,0.0,0.03912144109449937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052218241162270786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957621505459136,0.1347186670178504,0.4936719571554386,0.045551957963098244,0.04798054405475916,0.049228434621826245,0.07679910204606084,0.03791080674264941,0.042374652222472574,0.0,0.21846528958432632,0.048711816325073806,0.0,0.12404491613299122,0.03995984863257003,0.17551732456132435,0.0,0.09828467470102738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03951107265917778,0.040797075078699487,0.09010211549039801,0.0,0.0,0.08622175850741312,0.17186177718490708,0.0,

From his deadly horns, Barugon emits the devastating &quot;rainbow ray&quot; and he also has some wild tongue action that defies description. That means in this second edition of the Gamera series, the giant turtle gets to be the hero, so it sure was a good thing the Japanese Defense Forces decided to let him live at the end of the first film. Gamera was awakened by a nuclear explosion, but Barugon gets hatched when a bunch of stupid gangsters try to cash in on the giant opal, which, of course, is really a giant egg.Unlike the first Gamera film, &quot;War of the Monsters: Gamera vs. Barugon&quot; is in color (which makes the special effects look cheesier) and in Japanese (which means unemployed American actors are sparred being spliced into the action, a ploy that only worked with Raymond Burr in the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; film). The first half of the film is arguably more boring than the original film, mainly because it is a monster movie with no monsters until the second half. But you do have the semblance of a fight between the two creatures in the end. Consider this one step forward and one step backwards with regards to the original Gamera film.

The coming of age part of the story was also strong, although it certainly wasn't a main theme.If you like action movies with a strong story and moral questions and quandries running through it, you'll like this.

683825,B00005U8QP,A3OXT1YYJADAWZ,1,1,1372118400,A diamond among crystals,"I remeber when this came out on tv in 2001, then I completely forgot about it. I loved Judy, just not as much as I would come to in later years. I had been watching some videos of her on Youtube last year, and one of her radio performances really stuck out when she performed ""Dixie Melody."" For some reason that song really did something to me. I know I have an old soul, but I was shocked at how the song affected me emotionally. Maybe it was sort of nostalgic?..maybe it was her voice, and you could hear the passion? I still don't know, but one of the next few video results was the scene from this movie, where she performed ""Dixie Melody"" at The Palace, and I was instantly covered with goosebumps all over my body. Judy Davis is absolutely amazing. I hope she got all the credit she deserved taking on this role. Don't get me wrong, Tammy Blanchard who plays young Judy did a wonderful job, and it's scary how much she really looks like Garland during her young career, but Judy Davis is sublime. So many movies out there telling stories of our diva's of the past, but this movie is one of the best. It's got a great amount of well known actors, and really opens your eyes to the life of the hollywood stars of the past, and what a nightmare it truly was. Let me warn you, you will end this mini-series with a lump in your throat, if you are anything like me. However, you will feel better knowing even with all of her issues, she did her absolute best trying to care for her children, while in constant yearning for the true love of a man, and attempting to entertain millions of people for all her many years in the spot light.

176903,1424810248,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,8,11,1180310400,Another Typical 'Christian' Movie,"I don't know how to approach reviewing this movie.  In general, I am very much in favor of movies that depict Christians positively.  However, I am reminded of a country preacher who came to his church one Sunday after a terrible blizzard, and only one old rancher showed up for the service.  The preacher asked if he should go on with the service.  The rancher drawled, 'When I go out to feed my cattle, and only one shows up, I feed it.'  So, after going through a compete Sunday service, the pastor asked how it was.  The rancher replied, ""When only one steer shows up, I don't give him the whole load of alfalfa!'  Unfortunately, almost all so-called Christian movies try to give viewers the 'whole load.'  I felt that they were trying to cram in everything from a revival to a miracle pregnancy as positive examples of what happenes when people get right with God.My second concern with this movie is the notion that when one becomes right with God, everything goes for the better.  If that were true, St. Peter and St. Paul must surely have done something wrong.  They both spent months and years in prisons, and were eventually killed for their faith.  Instead, in this movie it seemed that everyone who was committed to God had the wonderful things they desired happen to them because of their belief.  Could it be that Peter and Paul's belief was not merely strong enough to get God to dispense good things to them, but that it was so strong they could 'read' the mind of God and by that know for which person to pray that they be healed, or even to face their own death with full faith in God?I commend the producers for trying to make a Christian movie for the general population.  But, it leaves many theological questions that families might wish to discuss with their children.  These questions will probably never be answered in human terms, but they should be deeply thought about by all people of faith.",0.7272727272727273,343,0.0446362890554707,0.11239892376855022,0.07573325725356383,0.0,0.0,0.15822465775813516,0.0,0.034371872055290936,0.0,0.15457276168965758,0.05489759637921948,0.0,0.0,0.09524748676979354,0.08510974989490994,0.0,0.0,0.10933495368934883,0.0,0.0500616226681003,0.0,0.0,0.18488729282202368,0.04129102949101651,0.10097658471541769,0.04135532924593633,0.0,0.05052283829713903,0.0,0.036200810282075,0.04502638724048217,0.0,0.05837732200489229,0.04374083622879867,0.10852854759012588,0.08443775441236706,0.19381797250434532,0.0,0.02546716544881036,0.14862162842299867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05579350405573949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318827103857868,0.10827736508174782,0.05049980077889329,0.08790525874909086,0.0,0.03570633154164792,0.17274830126868357,0.03407795573499264,0.18196683850057774,0.15094946153351932,0.04530116540821303,0.0,0.044170922103147506,0.11477778759244153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12231100910691989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3042141383448179,0.3001337033482227,0.20572575350418448,0.10834697366030274,0.0,0.0,0.2568241728292308,0.07176604734264153,0.0,0.3699945484559735,0.0,0.0,0.14005563635978163,0.045117544543904625,0.13211445955725434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15728875035683407,0.04461084417684529,0.18425133378748362,0.05086588598617294,0.08635603063886757,0.047658246664852924,0.19470113943030748,0.0,0.0,

Kurt Angle defeated Rey Mysterio with the ankle lock in an awesome opening match that was one of the top five matches of the year. The Ric Flair-Chris Jericho match was only good because it had Y2J in it. Ric Flair stunk the place out as usual, but won the match with the lame figure-four. Y2J should be in main-events, not suck-matches with geriatric people. Edge's victory over Eddie Guerrero was a very good match and really seemed to launch a long entertaining rivalry that produced many great matches. The tag-team championship match was extremely good. The Un-Americans pulled off the victory over Booker T and Goldust by cheating, which gives these matches their suspense. One question...why the hell is Booker T stuck in the Tag-Team division again??? Rob Van Dam and Chris Benoit put on a five-star classic for the IC title, and Rob Van Dam actually won the contest. Once again...why is another awesome wrestler not on the top of the card? Test...yes Test...the worse wrestler of all time..fought the Undertaker, who kicked major ... in making this a very good match. In his first ppv match since returning to face, Taker lit up the New York crowd and pinned the Canadian goofball Test. The best match of 2002...no the best match since Austin-Rock at X7...Shawn Michaels-Triple H/Non-Sanctioned. The Showstopper and the Game put every match of 2002 to shame. What a match...O yeah.. and there was the greatest wrestler of all time the Rock versus that Lesnar fellow for the Undisputed title.",0.0,271,0.0,0.0,0.08833508197235913,0.0,0.04789710236584718,0.2109175375329669,0.0,0.040091265656009886,0.04748973456900263,0.04507332072366167,0.12806483841062147,0.0,0.12518875597775606,0.037032143502032266,0.04963589977677915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05922743588604808,0.0718840254130338,0.0,0.0,0.19294701067472067,0.049809815160984636,0.05892971231267101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05101920205113907,0.0,0.0,0.1937732560278534,0.0,0.059409676253385564,0.05778396530890569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507740367996617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05913227645024748,0.08329555173107984,0.2590626687834347,0.07949688478926066,0.0848982662471878,0.05868902488287569,0.0,0.0,0.05152085314002011,0.066938262285736,0.0,0.0573029750806387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645038318317751,0.7501611459197763,0.05998950117374727,0.06318781963712182,0.0,0.05057016238541446,0.0,0.05580515883195315,0.10792672437606733,0.08631214331045141,0.0,0.0,0.05445351473135907,0.10524998237784981,0.2311469631297578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05203397714723711,0.0,0.059329842279744534,0.050362729149174126,0.0,0.11354946119710567,0.0,0.0,

The last one,Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief, was not great; this one ouch, is even worse. Ever since Eddie Murphy separated himself from this film series, the movies just get worse and worse. A much funnier choice,Beverly Hills Chihuahua, but that even pushes things a bit.We're back with Maya Dolittle (Kyla Pratt, at 23 is getting a bit old to play an 18 year old), the daughter of the famous Dr. Dolittle (we're supposed to remember that is Eddie Murphy, although he's never seen in this movie). Maya is packing to go off to Veternarian school at the ""University of San Francisco,"" when a DVD arrives introducing her to the school. Oh SNAP, she's going to have to work for 8 years before she can help animals; 7 before she'll even touch a real animal. But, what's this???? a fire truck??? better go outside and see what's happening. Oh my it is a cat stuck in a tree and the fireman can not get it down. Maya please go up and talk with the cat to see if you can bring it down.... Yikes the dialog was that cardboard. Well a famous actress, who just happens to be near Maya's home sees the news story and transports Maya to HOLLYWOOD by private jet to figure out why the movie star's dog won't leave the house.Well along the way, my 13 year old son and I did have a few good laughs. There were some remarkably stupid jokes. But mostly all the acting is so cardboard and lifeless, it's like fingernails on a chalkboard. The absolute worst is the famous Hollywood agent, read by Jason Bryden. He is so awful, so overacted, and so reading his lines the whole time.The best actor is Judge Reinhold as the grizzled studio executive. He's only in about 5 minutes of the movie. All I could think of was, Fast Times At Ridgemont High.Technically, even my son said, Dad that's out of focus. Yes it was. And yes the sound was horribly recorded. The music is absolutely awful, Disneyesque teen pop music, with horrendous lyrics.The funniest animal, the French monkey that wants to direct. He is genuinely humorous.This film is about Hollywood. A good portion is scenes of backlots of the studios, or in a studio - oddly this was filmed in Vancouver BC. Go figure. There's also a ton of confusion about the film title. It's Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts on the DVD cover. The special features call the movie Dr. Dolittle: Tinsel Town Tale. And the working title of the film was Dr. Dolittle: Goin' Hollywood. And you could think of this one as Dr. Dolittle 5.The special features are just horrendous, a bunch of vingnettes. Most of them deal with the costumes.The film is rated PG, there's a bit of off color humor. Mostly as you'd expect, nothing terribly offensive bathroom humor. Otherwise a fairly innocent movie.A couple of laughs. Some really bad acting. And I'd guess, if we could talk to the animals, converse with the animals...they would say stay away.",0.0,517,0.09927405526713928,0.0,0.05614525554015421,0.03851945871751221,0.03044311492012753,0.20108690870509358,0.027054394188085237,0.07644531385240197,0.09055258307492367,0.028648336012923808,0.0,0.0,0.03978461636184638,0.07061223401949829,0.06309656853671727,0.10057728452814624,0.0,0.0,0.07780402587695816,0.14845380744919703,0.156551464415534,0.0,0.022844530655060733,0.03061132567594763,0.07485953143989947,0.061317989286695955,0.03165882385773307,0.0,0.0,0.0536753288517007,0.1335222125308943,0.04030716662559197,0.0,0.03242750301077761,0.0,0.06259838108965056,0.10263427936003798,0.0,0.28320329083816564,0.11018143955785603,0.0,0.09686117627240717,0.030712147715698197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039744430487273746,0.12221494136893384,0.040136002016757474,0.03743829754958042,0.09775355097826914,0.0,0.05294215993101109,0.2561357551645878,0.050527749694463046,0.10792167159262797,0.03730239703046401,0.0335842613978052,0.0,0.06549269895053299,0.0,0.0,0.03642143197557986,0.0720126784923014,0.044767320278596395,0.12856236187031392,0.0,0.1209012281740374,0.06770104358973483,0.03537593910969276,0.0,0.1127653897092474,0.5880508501873863,0.0,0.04016180436286328,0.0,0.09642628816684488,0.031732995813864295,0.14187771531402704,0.03429879377709859,0.2560109425705519,0.0,0.0,0.03461033183405395,0.0,0.17140158277127485,0.0,0.04113427593385939,0.12006906913715869,0.06980759851508818,0.038868952261438196,0.06614497611755935,0.034148928074217065,0.0,0.03201025271776785,0.0,0.12028560969229268,0.03596394751629335,0.07918837788241023,

I can see some of the humor in the dogs killing themselves and the &#34;whore off&#34; competition does say some important things about the dumbing down of the culture of which Paris is only one component. Now that Paris Hilton is no longer on every gossip magazine and news story, I can simply hate the episode as a failed attempt at getting humor out of a woman that was famous for nothing. However, at the time, I was so sick of Paris Hilton that even an episode making fun of Paris Hilton was still going to make me angry. In fact, I saw that episode and I decided that my South Park viewing (which had admittedly become sporadic at the time) would cease entirely. It would go on the pile of &#34;shows I liked but now I hate&#34; and that would be that.It took me years to get back into South Park. And when I finally did get back into it, I only started re-watching past seasons because of my job where I am on my couch most days and in need of some entertainment to watch while I am writing (if only to keep me from procrastinating with the internet).Ironically enough, one of the best episodes in the show's history was only a few weeks away. Woodland Christmas Critters is one of the most demented and hilarious shows I've seen on television from the cute animals speaking in weird Southern accents to the &#34;mountain lions learn how to perform an abortion&#34; episode to the fact that Stan keeps resisting the narrator's attempts to get him involved in the story. The Christmas song is the typical understated comedy that sounds utterly normal until you pay attention to the lyrics and the late visit from Santa Claus cracks me up every time. I want to say more, but I love this episode so much that I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Although I will have to say that it's probably the only Christmas themed episode which has or ever will reference Event Horizon.Beyond that, the rest of the season is full of the insightful and hilarious mixture of debunking absurdity and gross out humor. There's some foreshadowing as Cartman keeps referencing Passion of the Christ until they do the movie and point out how much of the movie relies on Gibson's torture aesthetic. The Michael Jackson episode gets into a long drawn out discussion of the justice system where racism and class issues come into play every time O.J. Simpson and Jackson were arrested which is pretty hamfisted but the Michael Jackson as a perpetual child bit is great.Oddly enough the most quintessential South Park episode (certainly not the best or the worst) is the Douche vs. Turd episode where disgusting humor (the PETA camp is quite nasty) competes with insightful commentary - particularly the ever annoying mania that some people get into every election season when the push to &#34;get out the vote&#34; practically makes people who choose not to vote out to be traitors. Of course, Sean Combs did have his &#34;Vote or Die&#34; campaign and the South Park guys were not the first to point out just how much that seemed like a death threat.So this is mostly a pretty good season with some great shows and some ok shows and it then ends with the worst show of the series and one of the best shows in television history. Under normal circumstances, that Paris Hilton episode would warrant the removal of a star or even a couple of stars, but that Woodland Critter Christmas episode is too brilliant for words. In fact, if this season was 12 episodes of garbage like the Paris Hilton episode and then Woodland Critter Christmas, it would probably still rate a five star (maybe a four star).",0.0,647,0.02487725843532921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045772759181026024,0.2267582342698226,0.0,0.05746969307615927,0.06807518858012725,0.043074218544886786,0.030596219387929908,0.0,0.08972726683610373,0.07077937089089456,0.0,0.050407673851892064,0.029530135717291073,0.03046796627251565,0.0,0.05580194730160384,0.0,0.02830028358515907,0.05152185656860905,0.06903850880831153,0.1406938528626677,0.02304867261816412,0.04760063890296764,0.028158024150312547,0.024389487013724596,0.040351782462755,0.0,0.0,0.032535583871530285,0.024378193395265448,0.09072974422185698,0.04705991207299667,0.12345265365100132,0.1478518238695946,0.1561304931213725,0.1104422354574526,0.0,0.024272610885034192,0.04617726356225519,0.028671153014368435,0.0,0.11335764591599524,0.02496512649777518,0.08963663460132168,0.03675126605329642,0.0,0.08443555377203969,0.07348869785102333,0.028254814133735547,0.05970090634787573,0.31634284632156634,0.09496377607842575,0.08113283902096909,0.14021508973623262,0.10099126277107824,0.0,0.17232525987652264,0.063969401242654,0.0,0.0,0.027068673813906135,0.033654962307048175,0.0,0.06571859848886565,0.06816791107471835,0.17813588564008778,0.05318950921806078,0.0,0.27127752416443246,0.5735118624400503,0.0,0.0,0.0619558157673973,0.02416363151712773,0.023856080090546017,0.03999755679524057,0.10313993373397094,0.21995735329851937,0.030652816214000612,0.0,0.02601919002657882,0.0,0.09203961683971039,0.029217169458791933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05844143071921086,0.0,0.05134463622176442,0.1133968632246703,0.04812902992411769,0.053122987772698936,0.07234219310124575,0.1351840238081211,0.019843953552155468,
299805,6302178924,A1M1GL2X80S7JG,2,3,1375488000,A childhood favorite shines on Blu-ray,"Although ""Robin Hood"" isn't the most well-known or respected title in Disney's back catalog, this quaint little 1973 gem was likely one of the first seen by many born during the 1970s and 80s.  Its simple appeal, likable characters and featherweight plot make it a great introductory film for younger audiences.  A friend of mine growing up had it on VHS, and it seemed like whenever I went over to his house it was playing.  There's black comedy, solid music and, again, plenty of fun supporting characters to keep things interesting.  The bumbling Prince John and his slithering sidekick, Sir Hiss, are a personal favorite.Disney's new 40th Anniversary Blu-ray is a good effort, though not quite as memorable as their releases for certified classics like ""Snow White"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King"".  But what's here is good: the new 1080p transfer preserves almost every detail of the sketchy, watercolor-style artwork, and the music sounds great, whether you choose the DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track or the original Dolby 2.0.  I'll admit the extras are a little disappointing, though: while everything of interest has been carried over from the ""Gold Collection"" and ""Most Wanted"" DVDs (including an alternate ending, art gallery, sing-along option and more), the only new extra is a deleted story line presented in storyboard format with substitute voice actors.  At less than 10 minutes, this one new extra doesn't offer much added value to those who bought this on VHS and DVD multiple times.  A commentary, new behind-the-scenes documentary or cast/crew interviews would've been fantastic.But overall, the strong A/V presentation (in addition to the charming film itself) makes this a worthy release that fans will enjoy.",0.6666666666666666,281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330378239289425,0.3484521306959202,0.11251447080547014,0.10597420852554217,0.06276537983633983,0.0,0.0,0.16184565857223904,0.0,0.097887957225014,0.06560188493960388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089331752562723,0.0,0.13021400553328627,0.07827865419459945,0.09500638822603824,0.06365356187868332,0.0,0.12750537061529316,0.13166348460484723,0.0778851642469542,0.06746138123266764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13486028611231152,0.0,0.0,0.1280513791779651,0.0,0.11777927155750904,0.15274174783156805,0.0879912505772353,0.0,0.12772642490191266,0.0,0.08601033460822902,0.0,0.06905360146527276,0.16529010158763013,0.0,0.0,0.07784964999334361,0.0,0.0,0.05504428473360195,0.1902184985073182,0.10506801553825748,0.1122068164164802,0.07756705680562948,0.2793420819033367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07356115684021752,0.07795632060555992,0.04689714380629622,0.5618270592023011,0.07928584696323938,0.0,0.0,0.06683666437204483,0.0,0.14751112099081062,0.0,0.15210064542819102,0.0,0.0,0.07196914378562,0.0,0.1018327228717574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07257938350533215,0.0,0.06877133278764405,0.0,0.0,0.06656250773626941,0.07346915759924993,0.050024671134576586,0.07478386865253692,0.05488842446714798,
834238,B0002I831S,A1VB0SDJXNI9RV,6,11,1159142400,Second Time's the Charm...,"Star Trek's second pilot episode - Where No Man Has Gone Before - replaces the stiff Captain Pike with Captain James R. Kirk, played by William Shatner.  Along with Doctors Piper, Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman), and a pointy-eared alien named Mr. Spock - one of the only cast members to return from the first pilot 'The Cage'.  The rest is history...  the Enterprise explored the barrier at the edge of the galaxy which has the strange effect of boosting the mental powers of those with high latent ESP abilities.  Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood - pre-'2001'), and Dr. Dehner are most strongly affected - their mental powers taking on a 'god-like' dimension. Kirk realizes that human jealousy, anger, and weaknesses and god-like powers don't mix well, and schemes to abandon Mitchell on planet Delta Vega.  It climaxes in a fisty-cuffs battle in the desert of Delta Vega, and Kirk's tunic is torn displaying his 1966 network-censor approved 'shaved chest'.  Mitchell and Dehner die, and everyone is strangely at peace with the outcome.  But a TV series that took viewers ""where no man has gone before"" was born.  Check it out for yourself!

Typically you will discover these movies between midnight and 4 pm. For some reason we have found these four hours to be crucial in stumbling upon B gold, which was the case 11 years ago. The brothers Sid were having a typical good old time on Saturday night when a great 90's B movie came on. The film was captivating in the most B way possible. The part when the car owners pegs the thief in the head with a wrench really won us over. However the next day we had no clue what the movie title was, and never found out until a luckily coincidence last night. While updating the movie query a suggestion was made that we may also enjoy ""Captured"". Immediately a light bulb went off saying this may be that hilarious movie watched so many years ago. And thankfully....she was.Captured is centered around a real estate developer Holden Downs, and total nut case, who is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He is attempting to develop his dream property but getting sued by a bunch of tree huggers while doing so. One evening while going to his car he discovers a couple thieves , on being the guy who played Wishmaster...awesome!, attempting to snatch his porsche. He winds up scaring them off then hires his young guido nephew to build a car that will trap any thief inside. You can see where this is going. Obviously Wishmaster breaks into Holden's car and becomes trapped inside for lots of mental torture. It's really quite awesome and hilarious. There are a lot of twists and turns with an actual well written plot for a 90's B. We were having trouble like it on a B or legitimate level....but naturally B level was decided as the clear winner.Being a movie from our past, Captured had a lot to live up too based off the memory of it. It didn't disappoint, much like a chicken marsala slice from Pudgy's. Wow that sounds great right now. Captured fit into every possible required category for a B proving yet again why the 90's really had it going on. It's really incredible the amount of hilarious B one decade could produce, and they're all shown after midnight on any given night. Because of this you should always B ready because you never know when some fine B will come your way. Sometimes it's even by dumb luck like us with Death Ring. And just think if we never got to see the immortal Death Ring...things just wouldn't be the same.",0.0,452,0.0,0.053302556373600395,0.03591472301306836,0.04927987866983258,0.03894740631216605,0.21438382039044399,0.03461204563782021,0.0326001101516945,0.0,0.10995376647135771,0.10413559588182703,0.0,0.0,0.06022518558920258,0.08072260996124984,0.042891190959154696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04748110346528002,0.04005683064531075,0.0,0.11690462290310942,0.07832521356524702,0.0,0.0392235920874024,0.12150817149172928,0.14375563463754784,0.0,0.0343347723649686,0.12811625576384214,0.0,0.0,0.165944534751236,0.0,0.04004262686619026,0.07878311382286786,0.10064405399674371,0.09661765266053893,0.16445409271492323,0.0,0.08261291259788463,0.11787478044945894,0.0,0.05291752439437286,0.0,0.0,0.050847046594764356,0.1563557143019673,0.10269600744824314,0.04789669487254857,0.0,0.048083259389680645,0.0,0.1872499081580634,0.2262494100533065,0.06903480810741923,0.0,0.04296603280531956,0.0,0.0418940499879717,0.0,0.0,0.27957460595189637,0.09212943735309774,0.0,0.05482542940992259,0.0,0.07733750750684362,0.17322669243046182,0.0,0.0,0.11541314251130275,0.38632802446997316,0.0,0.05138101396174761,0.05271734484153151,0.04112099823185444,0.040597615740290346,0.06806673330909538,0.043880169974677974,0.16376383012737586,0.052164112850497046,0.0,0.08855747252384957,0.0,0.18795656200816832,0.0,0.10525029139469307,0.25601732025329416,0.044654183879950834,0.09945400663672146,0.04231129546234213,0.1747537570082391,0.04824390953874495,0.08190464885245713,0.18080645574516194,0.09233245401760715,0.0,0.20261934014830138,

This movie not only brings the story of Dracula to life, but also captures many chilling moments that will keep horror fans coming back for more.  Bela Lugosi stars as Dracula, creating the classic look that has been associated with vampires ever since. But even though Lugosi did a wonderful job portraying Dracula and speaking his many memorable lines, it is Renfield (Dwight Frye) who really brings this movie to life. His maniacal laugh and haunting stare are associated with renfield to this day. And just when the pace of the movie begins to slow down, Renfield returns with his torment between being Dracula's servant and trying to save Mina's life. Incredible scenes such as Renfield pleading for his life as Dracula slowly advances, assure that this classic movie will always have a place in history.",1.0,160,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10466689101761321,0.0,0.22766784913456442,0.0735134766248541,0.2769610858233216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057449495439121,0.0,0.19187089457383635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008464228390797,0.0,0.0,0.12414847352643141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08815436160033868,0.14584913657422102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524541659313942,0.0,0.0,0.05577654146819312,0.0,0.05130222310992041,0.049898367865360095,0.0,0.08773191972998592,0.0,0.0,0.3371789607569582,0.0,0.09023497654725707,0.0,0.33208820619201973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07192846769179721,0.14913946314844403,0.0,0.0,0.10135983356661968,0.0,0.0,0.08897992614299534,0.0,0.0,0.09896603374544087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09612517119189343,0.0,0.1838468630903768,0.3023015310228891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19275841173554667,0.0,0.2484446481031427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279107890182822,0.0,0.08697976929602223,0.1920099045449219,0.19610744106733619,0.0,0.0,

This chapter focuses more on the bad deeds of the 'Wild Bunch' (as in Butch and Sundance) in the Wild West. Kenny Rogers has a very personal interest in the gang's activity which is not brought to light until near the end. Loni Anderson plays a madam at a house that includes Mariska Hargitay as one of the girls who also helps the Wild Bunch on their heists because the Pinkertons never expect a lady to be involved. Dixie Carter makes a brief appearance as a popular singer. There are a couple of good laughs and the story rolls right along, there is a heist on a train and a hanging. I do not usually like westerns, but I liked this movie (and got it in a Wal-mart bargain bin for less than half of Amazon's price).",0.8333333333333334,145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12817754593894884,0.0,0.2788074233174329,0.09002633913744915,0.2543798135896147,0.10044107803709154,0.0953303480274903,0.1354289568613912,0.0,0.0,0.078323209197219,0.0,0.0,0.13071011896802268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601757592096009,0.0,0.0,0.10202102587057145,0.0,0.0,0.10795591255160783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732210782931131,0.0,0.1256518273450094,0.061106719394812985,0.0,0.0,0.10219789830335746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110503882739191,0.0,0.08133661158961476,0.13355676360970775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17617059955152523,0.24351961036469474,0.33627279163760965,0.08978017526037578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11771715416926701,0.12475056953123315,0.07504773639619847,0.4759786186312098,0.12687816058528645,0.0,0.0,0.21391240328461072,0.0,0.11802825103114095,0.0,0.12170047275090157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11130217708477437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12548297800421473,0.10651747908346629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

If however you like shows and movies with a more offbeat and even warped sense of humor, then this is worth giving  try.",0.0,135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24777557337048767,0.08000621910569011,0.07535560258293829,0.0,0.0847198807014068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10975322311121205,0.0,0.0,0.06755666056497267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594019346018014,0.0,0.29614248567967955,0.0,0.0,0.2876873042760582,0.0,0.18511816447642768,0.1214055001216786,0.0,0.2791662897190205,0.054305413588650965,0.0,0.0,0.1816461165063238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09820456923126764,0.0,0.07228367642738204,0.11869161619569,0.0,0.0,0.11114511480485827,0.07828122148886198,0.21641536788054822,0.07471123147072742,0.0,0.11031197849926683,0.0,0.0,0.09683867222513827,0.0,0.0,0.21541351445707332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938335565927213,0.0,0.1046149884489409,0.0,0.06669476620984434,0.32900093475957065,0.0,0.0,0.24371373401017016,0.09505175246815128,0.0,0.15733718936812954,0.0,0.21630991066534194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891401174481985,0.0,0.0,0.12164374741636709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009864276662862,0.0,0.0,0.10448415174184504,0.1422851574853053,0.0,0.23417869450111292,

Now that's a company with happy and loyal employees. You  know that working for a place that values the employee's role in the  success of the company is a company that will continue to survive as each  employee will give their all to the success of the  firm.&quot;Clockwatchers&quot; shows a company that has somehow become  successful, but is falling apart without even knowing it from the lowest  ranks. Petty supervisors who don't even know the names of employees who  have been working under them for over a year... managers who publicly  humiliate employees in front of others who have no professional need to  witness it... and employees with no real job to do other than to look very  busy and watch the clock.Instead of paying 100 employees $25K each, they  could have easily paid 33 employees $75K each and gotten twice the  productivity for the same expense (less if you think about the cost of  benefits!). It's all to clear from this film that you reap what you  sow.I have plans of starting my own business in a few years and if it  becomes successful enough to the point I'm hiring employees and supervisors  of employees (whether the role is secretarial, or even restaurant workers),  I will require the viewing of this film as part of their training.",0.7,280,0.05330656355917151,0.0,0.1356658374863959,0.0,0.0,0.16196455434847493,0.04358168242834202,0.08209671642219613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06268976820320493,0.0,0.07583241221861181,0.0,0.0,0.06327666935715162,0.06528623661834208,0.0,0.17935718630076933,0.15131241509420545,0.0,0.11040015237212499,0.09862302330962831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05226137530598409,0.172930217545352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008391740805993,0.16533264571493572,0.0,0.1216559084454231,0.1479085823336971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03937499191968624,0.0,0.0,0.052490107957569046,0.1210878641943585,0.0,0.3536629754915665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054100587307705,0.06196184003337988,0.0,0.0,0.20092439825539768,0.0,0.05800229092263212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04868967768088038,0.054529503807824606,0.0,0.060391655999298396,0.3269749699176703,0.4096371340726584,0.24568648485318437,0.06469629263634924,0.0,0.05177741601377241,0.10223680016230444,0.0857060800754932,0.0,0.23566042585430702,0.0,0.0,0.05575347502682447,0.05388129942600225,0.0,0.0626060506153827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06261364871095182,0.05327617619793691,0.0,0.0,0.20626012302446828,0.17074654336529943,0.07750680655961886,0.0,0.1700851360358872,
31458,0780622537,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,1,8,1101081600,"Fall, Fallen, Fell","A stylish and suspensful film with a great premise. THE FALLEN is a pretty good mystery, supernatural, suspense thriller. It's ALL THAT up to the last 5-to-10 minutes. However, the bottom falls out at the climax and it leaves the audience either confused, empty, angry or all of the above (while the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" plays in the background of the closing credits).  An evil entity transfers to different human hosts through physical contact, takes over their body, and goes on a killing spree leading the authorities to believe that there is a serial killer or copy-cat killer on the loose.  Denzel Washington as Detective John Hobbes figures out what is going on through riveting police work and must suspend all doubts of the supernatural to prepare a plan to fight the evil presence.  What happens in the end destroys the story and the credibility of the lead character (Washington) as the evil entity is allowed to escape (a la Hannibal Lecter in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - -perhaps the producers thought they could get a sequel out of it). The open-end conclusion is what hurts the film.  This reviewer became engrossed in the film, but, ultimately felt cheated by the end and felt 2 hours of time was wasted.",0.125,213,0.0,0.0,0.1575833264064689,0.0,0.056963285310986815,0.18813073141374553,0.0,0.09535984814272445,0.05647880907146567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04404175726270699,0.05903121026102613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17575768623056864,0.0,0.04274528151649331,0.0,0.07003627682064929,0.057367226179026336,0.059238045145833924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363436371638878,0.0,0.1766375298032657,0.10308236844318147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23963274024464312,0.14181662895794278,0.0,0.0,0.12568161102969844,0.0,0.18381886869463696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06619328271553507,0.0,0.08439986623005616,0.7434625699945375,0.07134458875868371,0.0,0.0,0.060142314375938664,0.05937683115082265,0.033184107465299865,0.06417779458092922,0.2395159694177562,0.0,0.0,0.06476072544296942,0.0,0.045816586526666155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18564962010417485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04501420778842802,0.0,0.0,

981089,B000F0UUSC,A1WT1DO4W2UH4F,0,0,1285372800,Some Great Moments,"This is one of the more interesting of the many Titanic porn DVDs.  There are a lot of logistics and mechanical underwater scenes involving rovers and such, as well as the analytical revelations for the accident.  I find a lot of this to be in the category of navel gazing, although it is interesting to learn that the actual breaking of the ship was likely nothing like James Cameron's theatrical embellishment.  Comparisons of underwater details with mechanical drawings are also a nice inclusion, as well as a brief analysis of the ice that formed and drifted into her path.  But the actual history, archival footage, interviews with historians, and computer animations of the ship are interspersed with the analytical material to make this a wonderful DVD for any Titanic or liner enthusiast to have.  Included are bonus features; ""History's Mysteries: Doomed Sisters of the Titanic"" and ""History in the Making: Titanic"", which make this well worth owning.",0.0,157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741964148379,0.0,0.21190387929209195,0.2736932937394732,0.257783998583934,0.0,0.07245456494998324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05952851495134134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838716014307373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155522980009934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787519175184985,0.0,0.10194093719461701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382902597389156,0.0994798274923521,0.09550000261016296,0.04644335052668786,0.0,0.0,0.0776741553302324,0.0,0.10461077408994013,0.0,0.08398700849013181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46270961427402374,0.0,0.06823622984936488,0.0,0.0849380238924442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407807069999501,0.5225439955503803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08129064058867398,0.0,0.17941160936080272,0.0,0.1849936560565393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06192744171862395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26482580934188144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953716709111552,0.0,0.0,0.18252874825400564,0.0,0.0,

571850,B0000584ZI,A4YJ34UI38GA,7,7,1099612800,"Awesome, atmospheric and even a little sexy","One of the best gay oriented films ever.  Definitely on par with films like ""Parting Glances"".  Urbania is one of those films in which the central characters are gay but it's not a film about ""being gay"" and thus is not exclusively a ""gay"" film.It's the story of a 30'ish gay man living in the Chelsea area of NYC. It's not really the traditional NYC - you won't recognize it. It's gritty and could be almost any large city anywhere.  The story involves this young man's emotional journey through a few days. The first thing we learn about him is that a romantic/love relationship he was recently involved in was terminated unexpectedly leaving him adrift emotionally.As the film progresses, we learn more about this man and the reasons for his turbulent emotional state by seeing him making self destructive and unexpected choices in his relationships with other people.  Gradually we learn that that things are not always as they first seem and context for his seemingly strange behavior becomes more clear. During the course of the film, he interacts with a homeless man, his handsome upstairs neighbor and girlfriend, an interesting bartender, and an old friend who is now ill, as well as see flashbacks of scenes with his former lover.The story unfolds weaving back and forth in time rather than in a straight forward fashion. This causes a couple of red-herrings in terms of how the viewer learns about Charlie's situation and mental state.  But by the end of the film, his story becomes heart breakingly clear.A number of well known urban legends are woven into the story (hence, Urbania) and they intersect the Charlie's story at various intervals. These range from the man who loses a kidney during a one night stand, to finding a rat in a hot dog bun. When the poodle makes an appearance we know exactly where it's headed.The director managed to beautifully capture a number of scenes with those quiet moments that tell us volumes more about the interior lives of the characters than pages of dialog can. Dan Futterman is nothing short of amazing. He manages to carry the film and make difficult emotional transitions seem natural.Overall, this film easily captures a spot in my top ten (and it's near the top!)",1.0,380,0.2031134953394196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11211522924951285,0.2468528042952422,0.099635323604762,0.12512493708127936,0.037053894113357536,0.03516848574938328,0.0,0.0,0.04883930127512766,0.05778870471980334,0.07745688162891867,0.04115597727379469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26905399043081263,0.09242448532697237,0.05608755429505019,0.03757823736494297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12293316162849377,0.0,0.1593845120892537,0.23884657950286844,0.04938495809485155,0.0,0.2267875502785968,0.04828619008244698,0.11588608955074399,0.1578009085549369,0.0,0.0,0.03770200575646812,0.0468178446535694,0.0,0.0,0.12229854309072968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04000051245535975,0.0,0.12998280920995883,0.31443036172675765,0.03101374621333151,0.09936288536294298,0.0,0.0,0.04721852269794811,0.0,0.052228619624392805,0.0,0.04471068095639064,0.04420111618679927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26056344980505014,0.09204390244167501,0.11074396779552648,0.46825095016655716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791038268761415,0.08708401784532101,0.04210494597755246,0.06734510200884401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06011751925032278,0.0,0.0,0.1965278702393961,0.08569529247594132,0.0,0.0,0.041920971947307484,0.0462921453140905,0.07859109974353329,0.0,0.14766172626608828,0.0,0.03240368931977975,
701863,B000066STL,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,1,1,1113955200,One of the Top 5 television shows of all time...,"Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital""). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...The MASH (Season 2) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Divided We Stand"" in which General Clayton assigns staff psychologist Captain Hildebrand to examine the M*A*S*H unit and make recommendations on whether or not to keep it intact. Hildebrand is amazed to witness some of the immature antics and wild behavior, but his impression is tempered by the great teamwork the unit exhibits in taking care of wounded soldiers... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde"" in which a ruggedly tired Pierce decides to employ unique measures to end the war, and ""The Sniper"" in which a lone sniper holds the entire MASH camp hostage...Below is a list of episodes included on the MASH (Season 2) DVD:Episode 25 (Divided We Stand)Episode 26 (5 O'Clock Charlie)Episode 27 (Radar's Report)Episode 28 (For the Good of the Outfit)Episode 29 (Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde)Episode 30 (Kim)Episode 31 (L.I.P.)Episode 32 (The Trial of Henry Blake)Episode 33 (Dear Dad...

1124923,B00108EF34,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,0,2,1232841600,"""Cold Prey"" is a Norwegian Slasher flick that Slowly Freezes!","I have heard such great things about ""Cold Prey"", so when I saw this under amazon's ""vine program"", I immediately decided to pick it out. Also, known as ""Fritt Vilt"" in its native Norwegian roots, the film had very promising reviews in Europe (?) and has been referred to as ""the most perfect slasher film ever made""--well, whoever, said those things about this film deserves a ""Leopard Thrust"" in the face.Five friends decide to go up the mountains for a little snowboarding. One of their number, Morten (Rolf Kristian Larsen) breaks his leg while doing some stunts and they end up taking shelter from a blizzard in an abandoned ski lodge until the storm breaks. The five friends try to make the most out of their problems, but unfortunately, they're not alone. A huge killer with a pick ax is bent on killing all of them--oh, did I mention the killer is wearing winter gear?Despite what the dvd back cover says, ""Cold Prey"" is just another ""helplessly trapped by an insane killer"" movie. The film does have some nice cinematography and the deserted ski lodge does exude somewhat of an intimidating and ominous atmosphere. The colors are intentionally muted to exude some creepiness and the acting is fairly decent. Well, Ingrid Bolso Bordal (who plays Jannicke) is actually the actress who steals the show, but unfortunately she was given so little to work with. The acting wasn't bad, but the film definitely carried too much obligatory dry dialogue.The problems with the film begins because it is so badly paced and needed a lot of editing, this film would have been better as a 60 minute movie. Nothing much happens, the time is all spent talking and walking around, and when the first victim is killed, it was almost so predictable and the kill scenes are almost bloodless with the bare minimum in violence. There are also a lot of wandering around and talking even after the killer's presence is known. Now this wouldn't be a bad thing if it managed to generate suspense, but sadly it doesn't. A slasher has to have an abundance of gore and blood--failing that maybe suspenseful elements might save the film. ""Cold Prey"" lacks two important aspects of a successful slasher. I buy into a bloodless kill, but every movie with these kind of elements has to have at least one memorable scene.To add another nail to its coffin, the main antagonist is very uninteresting. We see him committing obscene acts of murder, so what is the motivation? His past is partly revealed in the form of newspaper clippings but none of them seemed very believable. An angry killer with a bleak past which was revealed at the last act but it felt like a cheap attempt at a twist, which ended up as a throw-away detail. I also hoped for the best that our killer may be a cannibal, but his motivations is left to the viewers' perspective, and what he does with the bodies is just so--dull?Anyway, this film had some potential but none of them was realized. The film is a just a throwback from 90's slashers (thanks, amazon friend D-Willie!) . I thought maybe something got lost in translation since I watched this in its original language and maybe the English Subtitles were bad but I thought Anchor Bay would know how to release a good Dvd. Regardless, the film never gives any credible scares (I would've been happy with cheap ones) and thrills are virtually none-existent. I can excuse a plot with clich&eacute;, so long as the experience is thrilling, but now that I've seen ""Cold Prey"", the supposed movie ""that left Europe screaming"" may have been folks screaming to get their money back. (maybe Americans are just so used to slasher films?)Rent it [2 Stars=mediocre]Video/Audio: 2.35 anamorphic widescreen. Extremely sharp transfer with muted colors. Some grain on some scenes but I think they were intentional. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Norwegian track is quite powerful and clear.Extras: Two nifty short films, an alternate ending, Trailers, making of and behind the scenes/bloopers.",0.0,681,0.053623814702061026,0.03375761733567045,0.04549108180455797,0.09362991569247181,0.14799721378700953,0.21723797023090882,0.10960264116197152,0.10323163826216256,0.07336924419783432,0.04642400447162704,0.03297561914443022,0.1261257259666455,0.03223505209955516,0.22885117421088258,0.025561653725468293,0.027163883122638153,0.0,0.0,0.06303986457700478,0.03007077015634762,0.27905706177373385,0.030501133533894303,0.03701906431160027,0.04960498646139654,0.030327060014428357,0.024841116492355656,0.025651217223835097,0.060695621800036896,0.07885860910088971,0.13046955181812112,0.02704622961696384,0.0,0.03506580367940808,0.07882209340693914,0.032595198038441374,0.02535982824893887,0.13305329124325205,0.03186998610460022,0.26005736619796516,0.10415219660843182,0.10285688651462926,0.1046409508361148,0.02488418319031944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06440498386472111,0.07921866012813455,0.0,0.060667945672927194,0.0,0.0,0.021447904236620397,0.2075312059614947,0.040939558875231256,0.04372117949836118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05306474602166894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029173744217048922,0.0,0.03472208449650698,0.03541469367502114,0.19591780670419076,0.16456209964127522,0.0,0.0,0.07309354307692077,0.5022164884186153,0.09268075302732459,0.09762199370789337,0.0,0.026042783258688935,0.07713394273037615,0.08621615519647428,0.027790224098201158,0.22224651205344967,0.033036617379461425,0.06773012199190338,0.0841279332473506,0.0813029566176874,0.0793578660846679,0.0,0.0,0.03242821851859608,0.05656084639882812,0.06298629047000992,0.08038986973812323,0.055337594089358316,0.061107742209237224,0.05187191726029684,0.0,0.19492021036433912,0.08741819033890376,0.0,

They can't breathe life into the meandering script about fledling performers trying to get a break in the Music City.  Another problem is the central romance between a narcissistic Phoenix and an absolutely wooden Samantha Mathis generates zero sparks.  The film's lone saving graces are nice supporting turns by young Sandra Bullock and Dermot Mulroney.  Also good is country singer K.T. Oslin as a sarcastic club-owner.

The inclusion of Amy Adams in the cast adds a real spark, but all of the cast members are just great. There are obviously a lot of historical references in the movie which provide openings to discuss the real characters and events with your children so there's some educational value as well. It's also terrific to see all of the displays in the Smithsonian in such an animated setting, especially Air and Space which looks even better than I remember it. Having said all that, the best things about the movie are the clever dialogue and characterizations (including Hank Azaria as a reincarnated Egyptian pharoah who channels Boris Karloff). There's an unforgettable encounter between the Ben Stiller character and an overeager security guard at the Smithsonian that is absolutely hilarious, but that's just one of many such scenes in the movie. Lots of belly laughs from beginning to end. The ending is satisfying and hopeful. Just about as close to perfect as you could get.",0.0,186,0.14449949965214579,0.0,0.18387647156164022,0.08410116565563151,0.19940322654173817,0.25610757930917605,0.17720701404538292,0.2225417219574342,0.06590242995174106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686343792448517,0.10278045414465073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08103137133919532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06683500384809223,0.08172199278163371,0.0,0.06912205099370174,0.0,0.0,0.05859580941262155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22408576905782635,0.0,0.1236659479130855,0.08018793452237166,0.0,0.211481108574912,0.0,0.0,0.09030918105529893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16010223464000686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23967087536647202,0.0,0.11781497822966379,0.0,0.0,0.08398079227533724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861416547415499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599219301861158,0.07390727792614152,0.0,0.08185262275795024,0.19696436109778792,0.5205066191690672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21053159895496168,0.0,0.07744190621922474,0.0,0.1996284049639096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07620694322049422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646663562293659,0.06988934050809249,0.0,0.10504986646783804,0.0,0.057631779781141715,

This is the worst HD translation I have ever seen in a film, a real tragedy for fans. I wonder if this is how the blu-ray looks as well? If so, then it's a disaster. There are literally 1/2-screen artifacts at several places in the film, as if we're watching this on a damaged reel-to-reel copy. That's inexcusable in a film advertised as HD today. Either release it as SD or don't lie to customers and claim it's HD when it clearly is a botched HD up-convert. Since I watched this for free as a Prime Member, I am not complaining, just warning other customers who may be tempted to pay for the streamed version.

This is a happy go lucky couple young, with money and nothing but time on thee hands. A hot car, plenty of alcohol can be a problem and for this couple, it was. They crash. Die and come back as ghosts to write wrongs they have done to others. The second one deals with the same saga but has more to do with the woman. It is truly witty, funny and flirtatious for those days. I laughed till I cried. These are wonderful mo is you will watch again and again. Perhaps let your children watch them and see what they like about them. Discuss drinking and driving? Still, both very well produced, great scripts and handsome Cary Grant. You can't go wrong!!!

I've given it 5-stars here to counterbalance the fake 200+ 1-star reviews motivated by something else, which is a misuse of the Amazon review system. This film is not as inventive as the original Happy Feet, and reuses many plot points, but it's a lot of fun, and like the first, I really enjoyed the music in this one. My kids, ages 5-8, thought it was a blast, and watched it twice. Like the first film, it's got a nice theme about cherishing your own uniqueness, and it pretty warm-hearted, without violence (although there are some scary parts involving ice movement.)",0.75,110,0.13382714406493684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27107673428303214,0.1094126445884275,0.2061053716902224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951893582814323,0.12758671253295953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25324846850110827,0.30448259708964437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301415180203654,0.0,0.1527097387154236,0.44559277885786636,0.0,0.0,0.24841046369057848,0.0,0.16727836169077673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317774167120004,0.0,0.10705362108655977,0.14797960704847363,0.0,0.10911347169024249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472945638494721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13689735887361867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38565068794275265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12998819000016182,0.0,0.2151667479516345,0.0,0.07395374897455421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09902537367218141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15250452929459896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

It will be of interest to those who are not aware of the derogatory treatment of Islam towards women by those who hold a stricter understanding of the Koran.Yet, I don't understand how a ""true story"" person knows what others are saying when that person could not possibly have been in situations where others have conversed.  That is, I might write a true story about those who hate me, but I could not possibly quote what they are saying in secret or away from me.  That would weaken my 'true story' claim.Nonetheless, the story is convincing and DOES happen in one form or another today as it has for millennia.Generally, the acting was very well done, especially by the women who were superb.  But one young person was obviously aware of the camera.

Everyone complains about Mira's ditzy accent, but she clearly makes that choice as a kind of armor shielding her from outside forces, creating a new ""persona"" to protect herself, shield her from all the pain she experienced before as Norma Jean - it's clear that Norma/Marilyn was smart in real life, but was smart enough to ""act dumb"" - get it?!  Although I love Ashley Judd and think she does a terrific job conveying Norma Jean's hunger and drive to make herself a star, Mira actually has the harder role, trying to make the cliche we all know as ""Marilyn"" into a flesh in blood person - watch the way she takes drugs and then ""turns on"" the Marilyn charm - and how about the bitter/funny monologue in the mirror where she calls her pills her ""best friends"" that sometimes scream ""Get out of bed, b*tch!"" Great stuff.  I like how the film re-created moments in Marilyn's career (calendar nude shoot, white-dress blowning over grate) - like many stars (Madonna, Michael Jackson), you get the idea Marilyn doesn't really ""live"" unless she's on camera or in front of the paparrazzi - This movie always plays late at night on HBO and every time it comes on, I am compelled to drop everything and watch it again! It's THAT GOOD!  Give both Ashley and Mira a chance, this should have won some Emmys!",0.9137931034482759,244,0.1290746589960194,0.0,0.10949884680728732,0.0,0.0,0.22876894761024177,0.05276358502895102,0.14908960036120217,0.05886756489473917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07759105503005337,0.09180898274466653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06106376987538408,0.0,0.0,0.11940117926300435,0.21899532613242284,0.05979355736151989,0.06174350210620281,0.0,0.06327193825573743,0.05234090177984611,0.0,0.3144406928856149,0.0,0.0,0.15691588131486797,0.0,0.20016535902634994,0.07671232663164196,0.0,0.2148844181949364,0.0,0.0,0.11979444123961253,0.07437956453225482,0.08066897654997787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04767061798462243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704340355390793,0.1970862994595882,0.0,0.0,0.06549864024225732,0.0,0.06386447920119755,0.08297566905372142,0.0,0.07103191110322446,0.0,0.0,0.5014646467341335,0.0,0.05894774605297598,0.06601792199007858,0.0,0.0,0.17593907109897922,0.3099628466356912,0.0,0.0,0.08036381715639782,0.0,0.0,0.0691752404770331,0.06689217689618057,0.17831873714902002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550877311174011,0.15159211351709284,0.08022326616340811,0.07805601429872377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05147977910298659,

1066174,B000OVLBGC,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,2,5,1256083200,Bugging you,"This is a fictional story of stuff that actually went on in the former East Germany (also known as the German Democratic Republic, or GDR) before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The year is 1984.  While there is no mention of it in the Special Features, it seems clear to me that it's an allusion to George Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four.  After all, the GDR came about as close as the world has ever come to realizing Orwell's nightmarish dystopia.I had heard horror stories about how oppressive the East German government was & how they were always ""snooping around.""  However, this film brought the stories to life in a dramatic fashion.  The denizens of the GDR were made more ""real"" by being immersed in a plausible plotline.For all those people out there who think that the Patriot Act is a wonderful idea, this movie is likely to be a sobering experience.  The GDR was a chilling world where warrantless wiretapping and domestic spying ran amock.  No matter how noble the objective of warrantless wiretapping, once you open those gates you find yourself on a VERY slippery slope.  At the bottom of the slope is the former GDR or present-day North Korea.  Neither are or were pleasant places to spend one's life.George W. Bush would be likely to watch this movie and say ""Wow, those GDR folks really had their act together.  Wish we could have been more like them while I was in office!""  That is precisely the point of why it's so critically important that we not sacrifice our Constitutional values out of fear.  I'm all for going after terrorists, but I'd rather not live out my days in a police state - thank you very much.",0.4,287,0.1131331682325445,0.14244067574772815,0.14396262852997924,0.06584542746221449,0.05203966986913519,0.05728989062317981,0.04624696736031333,0.13067614488066848,0.051597069281292034,0.09794332494057191,0.0,0.06652362879028766,0.0,0.04023501270854201,0.05392885394843615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053522029838856754,0.0,0.07810119540814184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280529561396263,0.05545747624486279,0.04587648801524267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063037501385197,0.0,0.21053249100820717,0.0,0.22591783746651192,0.12556327334528622,0.0,0.0,0.05249955637885013,0.0,0.0,0.06443892149127901,0.11353276179374054,0.0,0.08356602428630043,0.0,0.06399728313131685,0.055700197289179514,0.12849312351201927,0.09049969203865006,0.25019441154744176,0.08637248258691455,0.04612051178189734,0.0,0.1722275017381699,0.0,0.16793050454099767,0.07272767868828615,0.0,0.06225904613056594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051667347587928236,0.0,0.06047187344031901,0.0,0.19276193216528537,0.5161931116407245,0.06517792689943423,0.06865286439563338,0.0,0.10988783979725739,0.05424460113378008,0.12126337081636232,0.0,0.2188134323509928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11435293715348166,0.12556930438763714,0.06643479136282339,0.0,0.13683126131662685,0.0,0.19932856238443808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0547185459908006,0.0,0.0,0.0614770190517341,0.13536515738566518,

Not being a George Hamilton fan, don't dislike him, just never &#34;discovered&#34; him, I didn't expect much but I love Renee Zellweger and so decided to watch this. Kevin Bacon does an excellent job bringing to life a band leader who is very good at leading a bad but sucks at being a husband and father and admits it, though not pridefully. The character played by Renee grows throughout the movie into a likable sympathetic woman. I enjoyed this trip across country with the Hamilton family and learning about George's introduction to Hollywood. It is not a laugh a minute comedy but it will make you smile and laugh and challenge you to think.

The live piano playing is a great touch & Melisa has good presence & gets straight to the point. I agree with other reviewers that there could be more cuing & explanation, but as another said, too much talking would slow down the pace & seem 10x more boring on replays.The 10 min warm ups before the 2 workouts were amazing, they really opened up my hips & she did many stretches that none of my yoga or stretching dvds did.The first workout is 25 min (not including the 10 min warm up) starting with using a bar & then floor work. The 2nd workout is 35 min (not including 10 min warm up) with the same format that includes more advanced moves that isn't on the NYC ballet dvds & includes a lot of jumps & high kicks.I've never taken a ballet class, but I had no problem following along. Yes, I would need instruction on perfecting keeping my elbows up, my abs in & spine straight but I'm just in for this for the balance & toning.Like a way past reviewer said, she loved the balance work & as do I. My knees & lower back are very tight from improper use in the gym, so I skip over closed positions grand plies & fast high kicks (I don't have the control yet) which still leaves me a lot of content that still tired me out & left me feeling much more graceful, toned & a good workout.",1.0,270,0.0,0.0,0.05603162648727246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05399928080840518,0.10172080095391649,0.060246212714959495,0.05718071268942752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1879182029516403,0.0,0.0,0.07840208194935046,0.08089200846879645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07513684237943757,0.091193187857233,0.06109874645875518,0.07470802767391155,0.12238778288952767,0.06318950288343375,0.07475914564361205,0.06475373421440096,0.0535666985369598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12291187671476535,0.0,0.18842008832918156,0.0,0.0,0.06444342978819602,0.06129998244276272,0.0,0.08255820211721329,0.22572217910991532,0.26512819477607513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14945011359808988,0.32518571121304285,0.07501612164551247,0.10567002686673348,0.10955030451443583,0.15127646873551515,0.0,0.0,0.06703258440588711,0.07677296086192537,0.0653601521613017,0.0,0.0,0.14539088319779958,0.0,0.0,0.17106956284102795,0.0,0.060328271674311804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22507434104958085,0.44411082190600176,0.0,0.0,0.08224589604899958,0.06415409114731778,0.06333754657125001,0.10619293306525716,0.0,0.03649897388673159,0.08138278238190617,0.0,0.27632228828871624,0.06676087878916576,0.0,0.0,0.08210205342469369,0.0,0.0,0.07758057538831348,0.0,0.0,0.07526675671637799,0.0,0.0,0.19206747324898177,0.14356464886331408,0.0,

These movies were not produced without thought as some movies are today, they spent more time in the out doors than in the bedroom. The story lines are very believeable they are not mundaine they are well thought out. I've traveled through out the Lone Pine area of California where these movies were filmed. In a world full of automobiles, jetliners, and speedboats. I would value the these movies as some of the best ever produced depicting the west as it was 175 years ago. If you want to enjoy a good story line,and great movies, I would highly suggest buy this set of Randolph Scott movies get out the popcorn settle back and enjoy a good western something most studios today don't remember how to make.",1.0,148,0.07618151400717586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573344952229093,0.24913393988983135,0.1759891765988155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09159046541871331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330191288536561,0.0,0.08544102319465585,0.0,0.0,0.052591714745693526,0.0,0.08616922761359752,0.14116368815093225,0.07288360871363359,0.0,0.07468781382779835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09261375938018646,0.07205567607229017,0.18902424653796723,0.0,0.0,0.04227584366539945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07645059197038521,0.09149795119356936,0.0,0.5543964638985343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12188120715431781,0.1684756943130989,0.05816142688150007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30154905724613634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15585848648934003,0.16288198927000794,0.08630696635171733,0.0,0.29271045612024266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21916309278597446,0.08165622272166338,0.07896123609118383,0.16839359765921424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07700288093773762,0.0563704990058862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035405418526548,0.1789649243106415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16558936556545026,0.06076804762957288,

632161,B00005JNLQ,A1XGV3Z001NDSU,1,1,1383609600,The Life FANTASTIC!!!  Wes= Cinema!,"Wes is by far one of the best directors in our modern day world. Most of his films fascinate me beyond my imagination, and even to the point of pondering, &#34;How did this man do it.&#34; I think I'm a person who will never understand what it's like to hate a Wes Anderson film. I absolutely adore his films by way of narrative style, cinematography, colors, and vivd characters and environments. One particular thing about his films that I think no one else can capture is the human emotion that occurs within in these quirky environments. Whenever viewing his films, I always capture a sense of emotion that connects to my life, and for many others as well. By Wes creating his films through his vision, he continues to inspire me to become a filmmaker myself.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is by far one of the most underrated comedy masterpieces of our time. The film is a tribute to the great oceanographer Jacque Yves Cousteau. Anderson usually incorporates underwater scenes within most of his films, (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom) so it was quite necessary for his interest to be placed within this story. I really do not wish to reveal much about this film, but... Wow! Never have I seen a movie so damn funny, so damn creative, and so well acted. Everything with this film hit high points for me, and to be honest, critics... What were you thinking? Just because a film is dead pan mixed in with surreal environments doesn't make it boring, it creates a world of it's own.Theory: Maybe people should actually think about what their watching, instead of always expecting predictable plots(Sorry, this is my opinion, not everyone's entitled to it.)The story is greatly planned out, the script is absolute genius, and Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe SHINE.By far in my top favorite films list! It's quite alright if you do not like this film at all, but give it try, and you might get a jolly good show!",1.0,345,0.14074799975375685,0.0,0.03980059236864877,0.0,0.0,0.2138215778086332,0.0,0.03612734796391207,0.04279431286128511,0.08123363106789978,0.05770138337487403,0.0,0.05640552467442106,0.06674137681891272,0.2236414083461037,0.04753189400764765,0.16707257133941847,0.0,0.0,0.052618421797311646,0.26634518453847944,0.0,0.09716502422594646,0.0,0.053066882803955294,0.04346747152516842,0.04488500163050555,0.0,0.0,0.03804969562124187,0.04732602160214172,0.0,0.0,0.3677985087639825,0.057035715082660504,0.04437512350272706,0.11640962575546375,0.0,0.21414280754767648,0.2343182796254361,0.0,0.04577569563182748,0.08708566095128144,0.0,0.05864304777770646,0.16033581394174853,0.0,0.16904565077098244,0.03465459024800003,0.0,0.05307897899516585,0.18478969464203368,0.053285729254498926,0.11258988704876388,0.25938725961196285,0.0,0.1530083501260192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046426865261812916,0.060319918918146725,0.0,0.05163729521208774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0619693236962702,0.17141040514037492,0.0,0.1003100488985078,0.0,0.09592538352737007,0.225330316584706,0.05405819815420558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15086271473206506,0.04862787769778128,0.2592608625897617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03471548657439511,0.0,0.058319034549666596,0.0,0.09897127534654318,0.05510732153129394,0.14066776647616397,0.0,0.0,0.04538324771275269,0.05009229808144996,0.10232255900775289,0.0,0.11227108392723417,
786375,B0000VCZMK,AM244N2ISKE6P,1,1,1061337600,Doesn't disappoint.,"First things first, Ronnie Yu is an incredibly talented director.  He resurrected Chucky in Bride of Chucky, now he does the same thing to those venerable warhorses, Freddie and Jason.  The special effects are something to be seen.  Garish, gory, bloody and in some instances spectacular.  After all what does one go to a movie like this for?  It's philosophical underpinnings?  The story is just a set up for the showdown.  It's rife with interesting themes but not a whole lot of coherence.  But there are a whole lot of set pieces that more than justify some of the tedium between.  Jason at a rave party is hilarious, so is a sequence set in a mental hospital where the victims of Freddy have been given a drug to suppress their dreams.  This is some trippy, horror.  The final battle is kind of like WWF crossed with Mortal Kombat.  The final scene is a kick and probably the indicator of a sequel to follow.  As long as the horror and the humor are as expertly presented as in this movie I wouldn't mind seeing a rematch.",1.0,185,0.0,0.10473338468116085,0.07056829459886851,0.0,0.07652716802239237,0.1684958070152885,0.20402605073833507,0.25622184821564586,0.07587629975904908,0.07201549609410964,0.0,0.09782661824518996,0.0,0.11833555384469836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892602146562819,0.11485206033740536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746387353048919,0.1678224587050655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20639966079817648,0.0,0.33222448087260703,0.0923238150904894,0.0,0.08116242956623636,0.1544069123500799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08347805395080822,0.0,0.12288838875424844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654236235580131,0.3219339417705791,0.0,0.06782272376607293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597964783550311,0.25527787572047395,0.08892718249430827,0.09424044219605467,0.056693383367840876,0.43947320223465947,0.09584769034329581,0.0,0.0,0.08079802582270111,0.0,0.13374329204184737,0.0,0.22984076166166129,0.0,0.0,0.08700261739064863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313682279993823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12094842578033313,0.0,0.0,

1631446,B00BEIYO5O,A328S9RN3U5M68,1,1,1398124800,`I am not going to die for you.',"Canadian director Courtney Solomon steers this `script' by Sean Finnegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker and the result is a relentless 90 minutes car chase move, a little on the over used side. Former race car driver Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is pitted against the clock as he commandeers a custom Shelby Super Snake Mustang, taking it and its unwitting owner `The Kid' (Selena Gomez) on a high-speed adventure at the command of a mysterious villain called The Voice (Jon Voight) on a race against time to save the life of his kidnapped wife Leanne (Rebecca Budig). The only thing that distinguishes the story from the legions of stories out of the same can is the `The Kid' knowledge of computers and hacking and GPS manipulation - throws an undated light on an old worn out story. Hawke is fine as the ever panicked-desperate-to-get-his-wife-back-obedient-to-the-Voice guy, Selena Gomez pulls off her rasty mouthed role well and all we see of Jon Voight is his mouth until the end. The final few minutes (the reason behind the whole movie) are rather silly.

Not sure how accurate it was to the real Buffalo Soldiers story. However, it is still a part of our history. Danny Glover did a great job portraying an Army officer, he is a great actor. It had to be tough during this time of our history dealing with the pressure always being treated less than the white officers of equal rank and fighting the enemy all at the same time. I enjoyed the scenery of the ole west. Thanks to the actors involved in making this film. The movie was entertaining; I just wish it had some extras like the making of Buffalo Soldiers.  It was well worth watching for me because I am fan of westerns.",0.0,126,0.10398821767610594,0.0,0.08821708308700571,0.0,0.09566624187560968,0.05265894794458486,0.0,0.0,0.0948525946138694,0.09002622266271783,0.12789376811954337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983913131100491,0.0,0.07178800201345051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19897311484829666,0.23540397365599022,0.0,0.0,0.10489702115946932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12641832990247695,0.0,0.064504803925269,0.0,0.11866063242816631,0.2885338845526545,0.0,0.10146075986796943,0.09651166641777828,0.0,0.0,0.11846019517591852,0.0,0.0,0.1536221792348035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08318428470058972,0.34495548037506923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10637387843325914,0.11116743987347963,0.11780952007728998,0.0,0.5493833203200158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16719184122914169,0.21556510955796926,0.17239369337356117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308381947062375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10968375972401812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755985204613211,0.0,0.0,

1007958,B000GYHRH4,A3RMTDAFFWASUR,3,3,1185235200,Good documentary about contractor dominated war,"Good feature on the colossal wasteful expenditure on part of the government, the obscene profits generated by contractors (e.g., $80 can of coke, manufactured locally in Iraq), and in general the pre-ponderance of the contractors in all facets of the war. There are more private contractors than government personnel in Iraq - and the documentary shows the immense allure of the goverment personnel to switch sides and join contractors to get paid as much as 6-times of what the government pays (for the same dangers). And it works from the government perspective also since they don't have to account for private contractors killed to the American people.However, I do realize that like anything pertaining to the government, a war should never be expected to be run efficiently. Some of the basic war requirements like feeding the troops, and taking care of their water supplies and safety should never be handed to non-government agencies.The only reason to give this documentary a 4-star is that it seems to be out too late in the game. Most viewers may already be aware of the ravaging of the tax-payer by government's war contractors.",1.0,189,0.0,0.0,0.05611440445981498,0.07699658556195393,0.0,0.20097641409043834,0.054079056307784784,0.10187107754226929,0.0,0.2863259412863782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612379560241163,0.06701467908772105,0.0785179087741947,0.08101151377099323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09132791154229729,0.06118901030925921,0.07481839711080272,0.06128429585711719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053645834963629346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20515576634367183,0.0,0.037739689913372135,0.07341393086951487,0.0,0.0,0.12278108717597533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637997006362424,0.07944518288968695,0.0,0.0,0.0748354513938075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3657071599028281,0.10099997071957773,0.0,0.07456379970667454,0.0,0.0,0.0654567115728371,0.08504437059138789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06766384275567072,0.0,0.07493799191154064,0.09016274128720066,0.6353813232112767,0.07621604139699645,0.0,0.0,0.06424886879216607,0.06343111789908173,0.0354499388433273,0.0,0.32897605875534575,0.08150301272587046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06610863032212914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

116703,0790745399,A1JJOV69MAU2J2,2,3,1002499200,A defining moment in film ushers us into the DVD age...,"The Matrix takes us beyond the standard sci-fi adventure by weaving myth-making (&quot;You're the One, Neo&quot;) and classic story-telling (take the Red Pill, go to the &quot;Real World,&quot; take the Blue Pill, stay in &quot;Neverland&quot;) with truly revolutionary special effects, sound and overall production quality. This is the movie that made DVD players more than just a luxury item, it made DVD a necessity. Watching this on VHS would be like watching a Picasso behind layers of gauze. No movie is sharper or better suited to the digital world than a movie where the premise is that the world we see every day is nothing but ones and zeroes hardwired into our head.In the realm of action and sci-fi, there will be movies that are B.M. (Before the Matrix) and movies that are A.M. (You guessed it). This is now the standard.As far as the other qualities of the film -- you know, acting and the like -- they are good, but not oscar-caliber, with the exception of Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus. Keanu Reeves plays the only character he knows how (himself), which is fine, and the other actors/actresses all perform their roles efficiently. But, frankly, it's hard for the acting to matter too much when buildings are exploding, people are flying through the air and reality is warping around you.This is quite simply a movie that redefines the too-often used adjecting &quot;mind-blowing.&quot;BTW, the intensity of this movie means that young children and squeamish adults should stay away. I know several people who were unable to handle several of the sequences in the movie. I had no trouble, but I'd put the squeamish content as on a par with Aliens or Terminator 2. Hope that helps.On to the sequels!",0.6666666666666666,289,0.0,0.0,0.033397748995079024,0.0,0.0,0.17942344473771293,0.16093182898800532,0.12126172273828173,0.0,0.06816532767240012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200897363225393,0.03753270580330672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256273934622633,0.0,0.03724956962479391,0.0,0.027177929582400867,0.0,0.0,0.036474726054375205,0.0,0.044560319552013256,0.0,0.0,0.03971253934524487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04786020465328589,0.0,0.07326183915018555,0.04679536094441476,0.17969299726333748,0.06554092642143206,0.0,0.038411619069045846,0.07307592355867731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03950753108452561,0.0,0.17447760011859015,0.0954988704299676,0.044540000836570594,0.0,0.08942698109505112,0.03149240219182343,0.1305953013282125,0.09016860384801215,0.03209835688077127,0.044378321229555366,0.07990977841729416,0.09152131527211796,0.0,0.10123213708842481,0.5935545228704134,0.0,0.0428364131147136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042086431827022125,0.08920206026063024,0.18781833665028203,0.5105179909974197,0.04536169000596452,0.0,0.0,0.038239158265952373,0.0377524554428423,0.10549413923016898,0.0,0.10877638620073761,0.0970166996358542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047615025164476577,0.0,0.04624203768743437,0.0,0.04062666799897431,0.044862882020001056,0.03808230545045696,0.04203379644240561,0.08586161508910006,0.04278598006067824,0.12561292038660907,

The scripts are boring, disjointed, and there is only about 30 seconds of real action in each episode I saw.I looked at the episodes on the first two discs, they were boring, nothing but talk. Looked at disk 3 and this would not play at all.  Finally got rid them in the bin where rubbish belongs, a total waste of money.  Even the Pilot episode taken from the POLICE STORY Series was slow, no action. If I had been able to see the pilot episode before buying I would have saved my money.  Regrettably now, I ordered the 1st series of POLICE STORY before I received POLICE WOMAN, I expect this (hopefully wrong) to be the same kind of boring materialwhen it arrives.  Nothing in the police type series touches T.J.HOOKER, this is action and suspense all the way through.How in heavens name this Police Woman series got any 5 star reviews I do not know",0.06666666666666667,178,0.07630868297014197,0.0,0.19420650462933509,0.0,0.0,0.15456885612793245,0.062387454108501994,0.0,0.2784191029729821,0.13212617040069263,0.0,0.08974079977937337,0.0,0.0542772889160997,0.0,0.0,0.09058095249418147,0.0,0.0,0.08558364895440912,0.0,0.08680849514342547,0.0,0.07058974089501703,0.0,0.07069966557103874,0.0,0.08637212752110748,0.0,0.061887675107672235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09276835850951934,0.0721759578193958,0.18933978263252974,0.0,0.13061340193175675,0.08469282853198164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07513992161127624,0.08666902181831918,0.1220846621121362,0.16875692893556613,0.058258515111335625,0.0,0.08601935665963258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303064639768101,0.5161673774738498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16315388638220463,0.0,0.0,0.43979861169511464,0.0,0.09261315219936553,0.0,0.07411969858500325,0.07317631310830176,0.2453775916669147,0.0,0.08433734761932031,0.0,0.09638248295697152,0.0,0.0,0.056464597659527875,0.0,0.09485567240091052,0.0,0.0,0.08963183424465562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16586578207110267,0.0,

This movie to me is more about being ""called"" than simply ""girls can do everything boys can do!"" Pai has been ""called"" to the role of leader, you can see it in her being really-and it simply takes time for her Grandfather to see it. I think Koro's actions in many ways are understandable-he is watching his people drown in poverty and the effects of colonization. It is THROUGH tradition and heritage that he sees a solution for his people's demise. And at the end when he says to Pai, ""forgive me, I am just a fledgling, new to flight,'"" it is then that we fully understand that Koro recognizes that calling too. Also, I have a Maori cousin who gave me a good insight regarding the part where Pai is nuzzling the whale-in Maori culture, when you pass breath through the nose as a greeting, you are in effect symbolically inferring that you would give your life-in the form of the breath-for that person. So, when Pai does exchange her breath the whale, she is ineffect saying she would exchange her life for that whale. Thus the whole part where she says she wasn't afraid to die-because basically she had already made that commitment earlier with the ritualistic breath exchange. AWESOME MOVIE-all kids should see this movie, as well as adults! There's nothing like making them understand that they are all ""called"" to higher callings in their own ways...",1.0,270,0.05319401639555201,0.0,0.0902529357453582,0.06191964395088153,0.0,0.10774839699864973,0.13046900277480558,0.12288507609018225,0.048520790006868014,0.0,0.06542263489340609,0.06255741010078471,0.0,0.037836152900697216,0.050713550870066036,0.16167697716629648,0.1262861442382785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146889416568387,0.0,0.0,0.049284026707909545,0.0,0.0602091425070752,0.10430206973648785,0.043141276670287006,0.16097671413451412,0.2591734660062432,0.0,0.1042537723787189,0.0,0.0,0.23097700604851665,0.0,0.2124483445127152,0.14759630012480626,0.0,0.05190112345931725,0.04936946973915663,0.0,0.06649030715385054,0.1817909866683678,0.05338190105199624,0.0,0.1571674349951716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763876003696686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13678313417699364,0.0,0.05854708698395774,0.17363948874100094,0.0,0.3444378476721734,0.0,0.048586878236409566,0.0,0.0,0.06026414994497432,0.3262846214318228,0.28103092832661075,0.06129194057378545,0.0645596981206507,0.06623878367260927,0.05166809736850974,0.05101047282878836,0.11403350292686135,0.055134967347220815,0.2057675125675022,0.13108730710790747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433660854383204,0.0561075075953133,0.0,0.0,0.16468217919415887,0.0,0.05145616052389677,0.0,0.0386715824808584,0.11562337059864575,0.16972603204649897,

Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Jack Robideaux, a New Orleans police officer newly transferred to a border patrol unit operating out of Columbus, New Mexico.Things on the border are usually quite tense, but it is evident that the situation has changed, when Robideaux and his partner Billy Pawnell (Gary McDonald), apprehend an illegal with C4 strapped to his chest.  Smuggling has gone to a new level, due to ex-US military personnel turning to crime.  Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord), formerly of the special forces, is the leader of the smugglers, who have a plan to transport a huge shipment, using a bus.  Violence erupts, when their plan unravels.  It's comic book time, when hidden panels slide back to reveal machine guns, manned by the mercenaries disguised as priests.  Robideaux and Pawnell go cowboy, illegally pursing the bus into Mexico.The new guy moves fast, and certainly has all the luck, becoming tight with his female CO Captain Ramona Garcia (Natalie Robb), getting a partner that is morally conflicted, and winding up in the heart of a storm, hanging tantalizingly upside down over an electrified pool.  Meyers seems to be in love with the sound of his own voice, and he and his crew are not too bright, which creates an opportunity for escape.Just barely in touch with reality, The Shepherd is an entertaining ride, that takes itself much too seriously.  Although the plot is events are most unlikely, Van Damme plays it mostly straight throughout.  Robideaux's grief for a lost daughter, seems an extraneous element in the story.  Still physically fit, Van Damme doesn't employ the same kind of tricks favored by Steven Seagal.  Among Jean-Claude's recent films, this is one of his better efforts.

770453,B0000B1OFL,A14CC5FIPR5YVF,6,6,1073865600,A great action movie,"John Bridger, an aging robber, helps out with one last job before passing the reins over to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Charlie Croker.  The job: to steal a safe full of gold bricks from a heavily guarded house in Venice, Italy.  The plan goes without a hitch until the team is double-crossed by Steve, one of its own members, who kills Bridger and believes the others dead.A year later, Charlie's been searching for Steve and the gold bricks and finally tracks them down to Los Angeles.  With the aid of Bridger's daughter Stella, a top-notch safecracker working on the right side of the law, the team plots to exact revenge on Steve and to steal back the gold bricks.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The script takes a back seat to the action sequences: the opening heist in Venice with a power boat chase through the canals to the Mini Coopers racing through the Metro of LA to the carfeully planned re-routing of armored cars via hacking into the traffic mainframe.  The actors work very well together: Donald Southerland as John Bridger; Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker; Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger; Jason Statham as Handsome Rob who has a way with cars and women;  Mos Def as Left Ear, an expert safecracker; Seth Green as Lyle the computer genius; and Edward Norton as Steve, the double-crosser.The DVD extras are prettygood, especially the documentary about the car chase sequence throught he Metro tunnels.

Jodi Foster and Chow Yun-Fat had suprisingly wonderful chemistry and were perfectly cast in their parts.  This version IS the best because it went beyond the romance and showed the  cultural differences and why it couldn't be.  It showed the passion of both  Anna and King Mongkut, but it showed that the King had to lead his nation  and not think of his heart.  The film also showed who important the  children were to the both of them. The film is a lavish, gorgous, and  amazing because of awe-inspiring sets, costumes, and acting above all. This  was the most underrated film of 1999, but it was also one of the best.  Andy Tennent is the king of simple romance and the period film.  Jodi  Foster and Chow Yun-Fat will capture your heart and astonish you!",1.0,156,0.0,0.09150319262933405,0.06165392509620064,0.16919512073943394,0.0,0.4416329425471638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06291831235529328,0.17876702615833046,0.0,0.17475227308566407,0.10338710060134332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27505831915212525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16452118400718518,0.0,0.05894166252694204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424364586071532,0.0,0.0,0.04508168044539945,0.0,0.12439586791333594,0.20165307991854814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08728787915128612,0.053682404814475296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11627311805476441,0.3214473297663162,0.0,0.05925518187258014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233574577954365,0.0495317285401296,0.5235788326442047,0.08373996218358584,0.0882045278481401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07789899563762033,0.0,0.0803226728609025,0.0,0.0,0.07601222172460523,0.0,0.10755347503932541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17073025659884117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0703018520223941,0.07759650321795253,0.0,0.0,0.05797194285288601,

At least they are organized by category - other than that - there are NO references to When these were made - not even a year. No history - just here are a bunch of commercials. Not much of a menu - and when I select one category - it automatically goes to the following one afterwards - without announcing what it is.The commercials are a mixture of black and white and color. My main beef is No one did ANY restoration. Some commercials are crystal clear - while others are so blurry - I could barely make them out.There are indeed some fun ones to see - Flintstones and other classics.I would have loved if there were some sort of alternate audio - hearing commentary about the times and situations. Who did the voice overs. I picked this up for about $5.00 - and it might be worth that much.I'm sure some people did a lot to get all these commercials together - but they didn't finish the job of adding ANY information - if is up to the viewer to know the history.I would prefer a documentary about the history of TV commercials - and how they evolved.

It is beautifully filmed, lovely scenery and a heartbreakingly wonderful jewel of a film.....I loved it.",1.0,83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13700355050878638,0.37706419176819506,0.24350649204962665,0.3440278514539637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409061229020137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14247462143152906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15022294233454753,0.0,0.0,0.14593391833480232,0.0,0.0,0.18475455896189155,0.0,0.16993379931674266,0.2479254908572984,0.19043275594449635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000110163954899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16467015829296255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16203980211910066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13602334685670409,0.0,0.15920280409302612,0.0,0.10149591331378213,0.35762337513911985,0.17159231452620702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07981176855216124,0.0,0.08229495802086247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505270732936286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488365530301416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900369714901372,0.0,0.0,0.2375816657260819,
458466,6305295522,A30T36G88X4RLG,2,2,966297600,Average Computer Scares.,"This film had some really neat aspects to it.  Meeting online 'teen' buddies and going to their places for parties.Captain Howdy (Dee Snider)  plays a body pierced nut who lures teens to his house where he does all  kinds of dastardly deeds to them.Interesting premise, but Snider's  dialogue was so mundane that it bordered on the silly.  After a while you  couldn't tell whether Mr. Snider wanted the character taken as a serious  crackpot, or more of a satan worshipper.  Overall I thought that the  similarity between his character and Sammy Curr from the film Trick Or  Treat was just too much.  Out of all the quotes and other lines he spewed  off, only one I thought was quite neat.  &quot;Your childhood ended the  moment you knew you would die.&quot;I would only recommend this film to  fans of anything horror related (or those that like stories about  computers) like other average films like Wishmaster and stuff like that.",1.0,158,0.08548955565088322,0.10763589729277873,0.145047956440897,0.0,0.0,0.17316538975011037,0.0,0.06583065328849716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06080751404381551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24266488528203042,0.0,0.05901749765834059,0.07908255453690946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676375629874356,0.0,0.0,0.17247338070464638,0.0,0.0,0.16754908313955136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488241699635357,0.0,0.08341171212425459,0.3173720893219218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579151021046372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09671963374196739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189060462141041,0.065267730694515,0.06970231843098891,0.19273708553151694,0.26028887592352207,0.19874063597758881,0.08459826260635449,0.0,0.3222293162306035,0.09409262150264477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808529816600848,0.0874508266738949,0.0,0.0,0.23305818705040687,0.2463558957268473,0.09850395062613478,0.10375565297135737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163317751793447,0.0,0.23621041839926915,0.10533699460474423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897739487578772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269660004572031,0.0,0.0,0.1858214747657624,0.2045785040108766,

820784,B00020X9CE,A3FIKATQ286DMV,8,8,1146960000,NOT AS GOOD AS THE SERIES,"Having watched all the series and the movie called the ""Warrior"", my suggestion would be:First of all, buy the box set called: `Blue Gender-The complete collection' for the following reasons:- In this box set, you will have the entire series and the movie as a bonus- It is definitely cheaper- And lasts for about 750 min.As for the shows, I wrote a detailed review in the `Blue Gender-The complete collection', where you can read everything. In one word, the series are: AMAZING!!! And highly recommended...As the movie concerns it is basically, something like a short version of the series. In other words, they try to put about 600 minutes into 95. Not to mention that many things that build up the story are left outside (for obvious reasons) and that the ending is completely different from the series. Moreover, by watching the movie the viewer will get the impression that the series are not deep etc. an opinion that will change for sure if he or she will watch the series.As for the storyline:In the near future, the main character, Yuji Kaido, has been diagnosed, as other ordinary people, in having an incurable disease. Because there was no cure available at that time they put him with the others alike into hibernation, supposed for a time span of two years. Unfortunately for them, in the mean time Earth got invaded by alien bucks, called ""Blue"" and most humans got killed. For this reason, humans retreated to a space station called Second Earth. A few decades later, Yuji was awakened by a soldier among other commrades, who was sent down on earth to find the ""sleepers"" (and there is a reason for it), in other words the ones that had been put into hibernation. The soldier was no other than Marlene Angel, who is the other main character of the show. In the mists of war, a love story will start to evolve around these two main protagonists who will have to go through various dangers and do everything to survive and to safe the world (well, what is left of it). The story has many twists and although it refers to a (near)future time the messeges that this show ""sends out"" are all the ones that we are facing nowadays, like the environment, human behavior towards others, military/political power games etc. In the show we see a possible outcome of our actions.To sum up:Buy this DVD only if you are a huge Blue Gender fan, so that to have a complete collection. Therefore, if you are not sure what to do, rent this movie first before you decide (if of course you have such an option).My recommendation  would be, to buy the complete collection of the series, where the movie is included; and is definitely cheaper.I hope I could help....",1.0,470,0.0574128397723464,0.0,0.07305817961367655,0.0,0.07922730198436158,0.15990415978536435,0.16428593293611676,0.1105259209907453,0.02618448963862143,0.04970429547261908,0.035305655683990814,0.06751884527729778,0.0,0.0,0.08210347237382051,0.029083266044756556,0.06815095621568801,0.0,0.03374711090901636,0.0,0.0,0.06531264894845722,0.19817404073664355,0.026555021826040578,0.03246995102919799,0.0,0.0,0.03249216815933201,0.05628713926371057,0.09312563227516563,0.028957299216259468,0.0,0.03754353134554287,0.0,0.0,0.10860695114662113,0.1780684415537899,0.10236569792376181,0.13102722652874146,0.07965108957974104,0.0,0.0,0.05328496789381211,0.03308427892851486,0.07176366083455436,0.0,0.0,0.034477899788651824,0.12722430135341753,0.0,0.0,0.05653349149877021,0.06520771253289914,0.06889019904112052,0.14283979112700956,0.02191616119734815,0.023405245292078495,0.032359459952625465,0.02913401411853624,0.20020453146754036,0.028407133825050678,0.036907854953399225,0.0,0.0,0.031235142661875392,0.3106816554568377,0.0371755251810388,0.11375122106741337,0.026220154485822406,0.0,0.09206483036238115,0.032521853201300875,0.19564571731722863,0.5790645431746706,0.0,0.03483996749173754,0.0,0.05576589993697653,0.05505611912161882,0.07692344548134569,0.11901545552120517,0.20622360288486125,0.0,0.07251588987631585,0.06004824011800056,0.0,0.0849652430642769,0.03371433940560171,0.0,0.0694391521474221,0.03027870014215349,0.0,0.05738011163184772,0.0,0.0,0.08330573153634765,0.18389937901422457,0.02086931500158592,0.06239673651220813,0.13739026694217515,

Just soak in the characters, story, and the performances that delivered these effectively.This is the &#34;simple&#34; story of a man with dreams/visions of an impending storm. Each one intensifies, leading Curtis (Michael Shannon) to greater and greater depths as he copes with these premonitions. His actions take a tole on his family, his friends, and himself. We are treated to wonderful journey that explores just how far Curtis is willing to go to protect his family.Don't be fooled: Michael Shannon is the star, but his supporting company is just as terrific, including Jessica Chastain & Shea Wigham.Other reviews will offer a more detailed synopsis or a thorough analysis of the mental illness portrayed in the film.I just say don't get bogged down by the details and allegory too much. (There'll be plenty of time for that after the movie, as it doesn't easily leave your own mind.) Let your gut take over, and you will be treated to one of the most viscerally satisfying films in a long time.",1.0,180,0.0,0.09765309244119992,0.0,0.0,0.07135370097991461,0.19638122873272174,0.0634110917412418,0.17917535969138484,0.0,0.2014410949866481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05516785700116665,0.07394403785617536,0.0,0.0,0.2849732714967794,0.0,0.0,0.14677244965479322,0.0,0.05354385757385132,0.0,0.08772927205171696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07823857752485638,0.0,0.0,0.3800239166437135,0.09429047836927014,0.0,0.14433481657102049,0.0,0.1770086316419959,0.04304122356497054,0.0,0.3027024195317435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783468608492405,0.09315446911547688,0.05729038177989554,0.0,0.0877492692701973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144073126483994,0.05921440615301506,0.12647540674265312,0.0,0.07871603650603842,0.09015411301004872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16583087425444767,0.0,0.15858221970992986,0.3725122637820699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07533583592997307,0.0,0.0831345617949345,0.16078156795478118,0.21430283394001007,0.09556740390833703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09380744467867817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16562347791627505,0.11277194792568378,0.0,0.0618682182745391,

850842,B0002YCUR0,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,11,12,1197244800,If you love Ewoks...,"Not everyone was a fan of the teddy bear-like additions to the Star Wars universe George Lucas introduced us to in Return of the Jedi (1983), but if you were (as I was), then you were in luck! Not only did Ewok fans get an animated series based on the cuddly creatures, but two TV movies as well! Naturally, the most popular Ewok of all, young Wicket W. Warrick, was the star furball in both TV outings which told the story of the Towani family, four humans who had become stranded on the forest moon of Endor.The first of these all-knew, live-action Ewok adventures (said to have taken place shortly before Return of the Jedi) was 1984's ""Caravan of Courage,"" though it was better known in the U.S. as simply ""The Ewok Adventure"". In this first 96 minute film, a holiday charm is added to the originally late-November affair by the addition of Burl Ives as narrator. Perhaps this, along with having a story focused on a human family, was to avoid the troubles of the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special in which the Wookie language composed far too much of the dialogue. Anyway, in ""Caravan of Courage,"" the two Towani children, a four-year-old girl named Cindel and her stubborn teenage brother Mace, find themselves in need of assistance when their parents disappear from the crash site of their family's starcruiser. Though Mace is reluctant to accept help the whole time, the selfless Ewoks form a questing party to retrieve the adults from the lair of the dreaded Gorax, a giant that is set on devouring the caged Towani parents. ""Caravan of Courage"" is a delightful film for the whole family, if you love Ewoks that is. It's a sweet, magical, and adventurous tale about family bonds, courage, faith, love, and unselfishness. Excellent for something different to watch around the holidays, and great for the Star Wars fan as new characters are introduced and we get to see (in both films) the last of old-school Star Wars visual effects.A year after ""Caravan of Courage"" came the much darker ""The Battle for Endor"". In this narrator-free, more violent Ewok tale, Cindel soon finds herself to be the last Towani after a group of marauders attack the Ewok village searching for a mystical power source for their king. She and best friend Wicket escape from the hideous alien attackers and take up refuge with a crotchety old hermit named Noa (Wilford Brimley) and his fast-moving, furry friend, Teek. But, when the evil King Terak can't make use of the starcruiser power cell he stole from Cindel's family, he sends his witch Charal to capture the child.Both Ewok films are excellent family features for children and Star Wars fans who are partial to Wicket and the other Ewoks. Just be aware that the second has more violence/death than the first, which has very little and makes it more meaningful. Fans of the Ewok battle antics in ""Return of the Jedi"" may be quite pleased to see similar action in ""Battle for Endor."" It's great to see these films released on DVD, and together no less. They are presented in fullscreen, and as far as I know, that is how they have always been. Unfortunately, there are no extras on the disc which is double-sided and oddly holds the second film on side A and the first on side B. Regardless, I highly recommend this classic double-feature DVD! Now, if only they'd release the complete animated series in season sets!",0.9166666666666666,586,0.02781072103214208,0.07003035376340361,0.047185743593444525,0.0,0.025585082853163865,0.21124748705104193,0.11368562623443527,0.14990820153664028,0.0,0.07223013010518142,0.0,0.03270605979193756,0.03343589210794578,0.05934411976487364,0.026513892188721553,0.028175808821910113,0.0,0.0,0.06538826442676454,0.0,0.07894163652499445,0.1265495221611148,0.15359248515399218,0.10290580391909798,0.06291364465377217,0.0,0.05321358432335006,0.03147834623724279,0.05453086570765214,0.04510996129813336,0.05610754483080298,0.033875055177426366,0.0,0.05450561504160891,0.033809454425094324,0.07891364455582096,0.2415172801500217,0.0,0.11107154607482467,0.061732650493983555,0.0,0.027134774991394186,0.02581118410406914,0.06410396388535232,0.0,0.0,0.08372685081436818,0.03340211898935508,0.0,0.03373120456588252,0.0629279853392482,0.0,0.06317309889520757,0.04449378954204258,0.33826930692637375,0.1698586581180697,0.0,0.062699557594551,0.0,0.03232629028681891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078162749792941,0.07524693852433242,0.03601557296704991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05946147991127956,0.031507105045352514,0.0758164687483516,0.6411389123286009,0.09613335350395036,0.0,0.03463074343792888,0.027012945055551997,0.08000738385742878,0.05961862166290721,0.028825482637141797,0.21515739089673636,0.0342673177911942,0.07025324619874085,0.029087306271813516,0.028110568138997007,0.12347123126072354,0.032662383247719445,0.0,0.0336362544813641,0.02933394293709561,0.06533269454414957,0.0,0.05739906421651528,0.12676833089383563,0.05380428186035132,0.0,0.04043629961119296,0.0,0.06655170518669866,

Who is that actor that has the speed and grace of Ronaldinho? Rudy Youngblood, himself a Native American.Gibson seems to have a knack for stories of men's journey from point A to point B. This movie is no exception.

The first fight scene Had a kind of ""Tom Cruize trying to be like Jacki Chan"" vibe. When I say that, I mean in terms of humor, yeah I know it is funny when a bad guy tries to throw a knife in Jacki Chan's crotch and he blocks it and says ""Not Cool!"" but when Tom does it.... not so much.The whole time I was watching this movie, while I was mildly entertained, I could help but imagine Tom jumping up and down saying ""Please like me again!!! I am sorry I jumped on Oprah's couch!!"" The movie could have been a good flick, but the delivery sucked. Maybe the same people who made M.I.2 should have a hand in it and they could have fixed it, maybe I just have a bias when it comes to Tom Cruize.I will give it some credit for Cameron Diaz's line, ""you should have just said 'if you get on the plane you're gonna *&^#ing die!"" When Tom claimed he warned her about getting on a plane by saying ""Things happen for a reason.""Sorry if there was any spoilers, but you didn't really miss much if you haven't seen the flick",0.5,218,0.07217067562282964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06639499613278046,0.1827337719444996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496133616938719,0.0,0.08487440614778582,0.0,0.20533593083152385,0.06880531829575198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08210111222537439,0.09964568530371586,0.0,0.08163255162118381,0.06686581961539627,0.0,0.16337681520774194,0.0,0.3511900731135293,0.14560282034030242,0.08790802712701865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20478616994040455,0.1343043101682425,0.0,0.041176866973751274,0.28035060312646515,0.0,0.14083310114391104,0.13396348791266344,0.0,0.0,0.08221462499614265,0.0,0.0,0.15992700971989157,0.0,0.16330231827747957,0.0,0.0,0.11546435090834001,0.07980285534530303,0.16529795428443234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09278986506635778,0.0,0.07943342333770691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591996743865061,0.0738263896306117,0.0,0.0,0.04918719804658937,0.2426372420980678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07010039376427495,0.06920816545451693,0.07735714942703285,0.07480404965668853,0.15952793629803266,0.0,0.0,0.07548349944824352,0.0,0.16020803937032452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3723859981764216,0.0,0.06981284967000408,0.07705676107006813,0.0,0.0,0.2878435215460184,

1176391,B001CFQO20,AFV2584U13XP3,14,15,1223251200,An Entertaining Action Anime Well Worth The Price,"I found this series to be both entertaining and very enjoyable to watch.  The short storyline is every few decades a sort of magical tournament is held where the victor after defeating or killing their enemies is granted one wish from the holy grail but only if that person is worthy to truly have the wish granted.  The person who is usually a magician summons a spirit to fight for them the spirit is someone who shares their summoners personality and ideals to the most point.  Also the summoned spirit is also granted their wish if they and their master win the tournament thus causing the servant to do their best to obtain victory.  Thus Shirou a high school student with some unlearned magical abilities unwittingly becomes one of the combatants in the tournament.  The story for me also seemed to have a more adult version of Pokeman in it but instead of some kid saying ""I choose You"" the master summons the spirit servant to fight for them.  The animation was great nicely detailed and also sharp and clear.  The audio was also great the English cast as well as the Japanese voice actors did superbly well.  There are some extras with the box set the standard textless intro/ending, trailers, but you also have some music video clips as well as some Japanese t.v. commercials for the series.  So I thank Funimation and Geneon again for re-releasing this great series for all to get.",0.9333333333333333,245,0.0,0.06299912834561952,0.042448175069484735,0.34946797441576105,0.0,0.1520301621708829,0.0409085202247719,0.15412232832758677,0.0,0.043318694369689,0.0,0.0,0.060157687204474466,0.10677163877412309,0.0,0.0,0.05939547910775132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20725711420428927,0.046286899895658366,0.05659695490935727,0.0,0.14361241583227913,0.0,0.0,0.12174241976936052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465401890136313,0.06207666619722831,0.0,0.1998393613819204,0.027767267781660884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570005142726534,0.05021364153273183,0.06009692278109555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11065680334421911,0.0,0.08159332370086007,0.05640436273473286,0.050782228834057516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20307586423417331,0.0,0.0,0.045703207245863436,0.25592418478072426,0.05349139627663527,0.0,0.03410215134372979,0.5287030254264642,0.2882710686736092,0.12145605439319612,0.0,0.04860155350056819,0.047982959515529465,0.053632760597208194,0.0,0.2765072032582277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05057639137566122,0.07404960398996693,0.058765993993084804,0.0,0.0,0.1583324432905748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680439056229662,0.0,0.07275278481768044,0.0,0.07982632656389022,
831089,B0002DB4YQ,A2BPDFR58H9575,4,4,1151539200,The Eternal Students,"Somewhere on his way from neo- to sur-, young Federico Fellini had made a ""I Vitelloni"" (1953), lighthearted, unconventional, bold, and above all entertaining film that tells the story of hopes and miseries of four friends, four young men, ""I Vitelloni"" in a small seashore province town. ""Vitellone"" means ""idle young person of the provinces, often an eternal student"". The title matches its characters very well. They live in the town where nothing much happens; they don't have jobs and spend the money given by their loving families. They have the most ardent hopes and they face the cruel disappointments. They are different - cynical skirt chaser Fausto who is forced to marry a girl pregnant with his baby; the intellectual and ambitious Leopoldo who dreams of becoming a famous writer; the irresponsible ""big child"" Alberto (Alberto Sordy, the famous comic, absolutely wonderful in his early role), and Moraldo, the only one of the group who in the final scene will leave the town of his childhood to start a new life.I loved I Vitelloni. Nino Rota's music is above any words (as always) as well as the young director's camera work, the character study and acting. I think of ""I Vitelloni"" as more realistic and sober ""Amarcord"" in B/W. One of scenes was absolutely stunning -the carnival - the music, the dancing, the camera's rapid but fluid movements - simply breathtaking.It is without doubt that Fellini influenced a lot of directors, and there are similarities between ""I Vitelloni"" and George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" and Barry Levinson's ""Diner"". Stanley Kubrick and Marin Scorsese both named ""I Vitelloni"" as one of their favorite films.Highly recommended: 9/10 (or 4.5/5)",1.0,277,0.0,0.0,0.050472550577105,0.0,0.0547345147064776,0.3615396910163802,0.09728368075656761,0.2290718917492244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042318560059066784,0.05672152911359762,0.0,0.0,0.07286645497703596,0.0,0.0,0.05629363784786287,0.0,0.0,0.055036945456825546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06734205298244317,0.0,0.09650435194021617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23320920281574373,0.0,0.0,0.1845289973696685,0.0,0.10183579918135062,0.0330163740891985,0.07608010480115714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970599578834125,0.07145760611927383,0.0,0.0,0.06731134620058812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32893823434985053,0.04542261634515456,0.14552650910803042,0.06706700691462113,0.060382068464650274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06360337516496235,0.0,0.08109759986934509,0.5714988206725915,0.13710625787542452,0.0,0.0,0.057789159679252126,0.28526813544073293,0.0,0.0,0.09863338373350353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06013731962650674,0.04402394657108601,0.0,0.07395644752349484,0.0,0.12550900384447164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17265634473366717,0.06352382962096195,0.043252962056964425,0.0,0.0,

They have aircraft and spacecraft. But they travel by walking everywhere. Alone. Unarmed. Naked.Science fiction with almost no noticeable special effects. Apparently, there is one alien costume, one killer robot animation, one alien aircraft animation, and a picture of an alien structure.It's the 21st century but the only cars and trucks that work were built in 1975. And there are a lot of them, all in great condition. And there's plenty of gasoline.Your group is occupying a school, where many of the rooms have no windows. But there's plenty of light. Because obviously the destruction of civilization and the killing of almost everyone wouldn't affect the power grid.So, you've captured one of the enemy and are holding it in a cage. Whatever you do, don't post a guard.A group of you are collecting food from a dark, probably enemy-infested warehouse. Split up, of course.A group of you have accompanied a hostile person to a motorcycle dealership. One of you should definitely go into the garage alone with the hostile person.Fire all your bullets at the bulletproof killer robots, even though the only thing that ever accomplishes is getting their attention. I am wondering how the robots always know from which direction the bullets were fired.You see a bunch of heavily armed, mind-controlled humans coming toward you. Stand in front of them, of course, and wait for them to get within range so they can shoot you.Your brother, with whom you've never gotten along, was captured and now you have an all-consuming need to rescue him even if it means risking the lives of yourself and everyone else. Your girlfriend, with whom you're in love, was captured (when you went to rescue your brother). I'm sorry. Who?Of course, the aliens have no way of finding you as you walk en masse through open terrain in broad daylight every day.99 and 44/100 % of humans have been killed by aliens. And the rest of us still can't get along. Okay. Here's a thought. If you're in a group of people struggling to survive in a hostile environment and one person in your group is a trouble maker threatening the survival of everyone else -- shoot him in the head. And when a trouble making idiot gets killed as a result of his own stupidity, don't cry about how good a person he was deep inside -- thank God for Darwinism.",0.5714285714285714,406,0.03702809183157091,0.0,0.09423693356779791,0.0,0.06812961061386277,0.28126172423484563,0.09081882781693737,0.05702646263020072,0.03377508204597441,0.0,0.04554037271190034,0.043545903898897724,0.0,0.07901267693771231,0.07060290408448527,0.07502836300293614,0.04395358033446968,0.09069895350347396,0.0,0.08305736881882113,0.0,0.0,0.05112449833958119,0.06850605478934069,0.08376525761436772,0.034306367340268415,0.03542514206544255,0.0,0.0,0.2102130058538913,0.037351698289983776,0.0,0.09685396729069741,0.03628526777073452,0.09002999827158946,0.07004544935505927,0.22968850286114245,0.04401345852430261,0.08450528132000112,0.061644632896850605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042675043533952274,0.046283574094021646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261660550515661,0.0,0.4708546158454727,0.0,0.18114099399060732,0.083480215192072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04760703173505166,0.0,0.0,0.04028986322370418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06764217147166061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050472247086201454,0.3378964142747086,0.04266501681740069,0.13481906007175504,0.0,0.14386362856283225,0.1065244138493461,0.0,0.0,0.10230982015838284,0.0,0.0,0.03872777863331727,0.0,0.08219679174076876,0.0,0.0460278491476602,0.0,0.0,0.08698605873572388,0.0,0.07642296718589102,0.042195862094395735,0.03581837895094951,0.0,0.10767638951911361,0.0,0.4430454443005328,

365768,6303257216,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0,1,1336694400,"Tense Drama, Way Better Than I Expected","Believe it or not, this is the first time I've seen this film which has become a classic of the socially-conscious genre. Jane Fonda plays Kimberly Wells, the fluff-piece reporter for a local LA TV station. Michael Douglas (My, he was sexy when he was young!) plays Richard Adams, a contract camera man who comes along with her on a series she is doing about energy. Jack Lemmon is completely brilliant as Jack Godell, the shift supervisor at a nuclear power plant run by ""CG&E;,"" and obvious reference to the real PG&E; in California.Wells and Adams just happened to be touring the plant, and looking through an observation window at the control room, when what was called an ""incident"" took place. Adams had been surreptitiously filming the control room when this happened, even though he was told he did not have permission to do so. Naturally, when the incident was over, he went rushing back to the film lab to have the film developed as soon as possible so they could put it on the air for the 6:00 p.m. news.Problem is, the power plant's PR man talked to their boss and had him squelch the whole story. CG&E; had another nuclear plant that was currently undergoing public hearings before being licensed to go on-line. They certainly did not want any publicity about what was actually a very dangerous situation involving both equipment failure and human error.But we're not done yet, by any means. It turns out there were some critical tests that were faked by the contractor building the plant, which has been on-line for several years. Jack discovered evidence of the fraud, and recognized how dangerous the plant could be.It gets technical at times, but you can easily just follow the story from the point of view of Kimberly and Richard, who don't know any more about nuclear power plants than the general public. What they learn scares the heck out of them, and manages to get a couple of people killed before the whole story comes to light.It left me with this conclusion: nuclear power plants can indeed be built and maintained safely, but it requires that the people who build them, who run them, and who examine them are all both competent and honest. As with the BP oil spill, it does not prove we should not do these things, but that we must do them a great deal more responsibly and carefully than we have in recent years",0.0,413,0.11749135554198913,0.0,0.033224099503708034,0.0,0.07205916650148762,0.23798739179067355,0.03201901481683114,0.12063123005210172,0.10716944829817009,0.10171635951981584,0.0,0.09211505867229969,0.0,0.11142659003199709,0.11201267059371571,0.07935582272156033,0.1394661587723914,0.0479651280341213,0.0,0.04392396136543516,0.11116767850433311,0.04455258724598875,0.08110985895038941,0.036228661546325314,0.04429832044457284,0.0,0.03746838103773284,0.13298589293529228,0.07679179219488144,0.09528754208204232,0.19753028249684496,0.0477037392313035,0.051220138295564356,0.0,0.0476113585350586,0.0,0.048587279222701764,0.0,0.08937934742362916,0.15213368451051393,0.0,0.0764238005523395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04461418552993531,0.07860422833236584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03856394362915851,0.0,0.18797195658655352,0.12991627928830118,0.11959970383226312,0.0,0.0,0.03974714627992789,0.0,0.07751094641087554,0.10070578697068502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052982354043672346,0.050718072401281976,0.0,0.07154361301467317,0.040062266830748615,0.1256028182303278,0.08873825976929216,0.10676673545375505,0.48905382247035184,0.04512583475720434,0.23765851122467974,0.0,0.0380403361721545,0.11266849178911215,0.08395650328068752,0.04059279902974169,0.19477945842323827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039586037723714246,0.202854655706862,0.0,0.0,0.18946981536620636,0.0,0.0920032102527574,0.1174243796946559,0.1616617287950654,0.08925924058386392,0.18942149451494658,0.0,0.08541518303193624,0.0,0.031239950980610838,
617652,B00005JMEW,A12W99SK787ZJ9,35,73,1092355200,Easily the most over-hyped movie of 2003.,"I guess I would be more merciful and give this movie a 2 (or even 3 star rating, if I was in a good mood), but the utter disappointment I felt after watching it and Volume 2 was so powerful that I feel compelled to rate it even lower.""Kill Bill"" is not a good movie.  The acting is atrocious and the story is stupid.  Then again, Kill Bill was not recommended to me on the basis of its story or acting---it was hyped-up because of its action scenes, its direction, and its humor.  And none of these three things are particularly great.Firstly, the direction.  Okay, so, Tarantino did a couple of quirky things, but they didn't lend themselves to the movie very well.  Switching from color to black and white in the middle of a fight might be a very good way to direct a scene if it achieved some purpose---but instead, it's just something for people to point at and go, ""Look!  It's DIFFERENT!""  The movie is full of little experimental things like that which are cool in their own way, but don't actually make the movie any better.Then we have the humor.  Pretty much all of the humor in the movie is supposed to come from one of two sources:  either over-the-top gore that is meant to be hilarious, or over-the-top shocks.  The shocking moments are neither shocking or funny, such as when The Bride wakes up to find out she's been prostituted by her orderly.  It's not shocking because the acting and pacing of the scenes are miserable, and it isn't funny because there isn't actually any joke about.  Tarantino assumes that shocking material is inherently funny, but it isn't.  You need to actually set up a joke and have a punchline in order to make people laugh.The over-the-top gore is actually a great disappointment.  Go see the movie ""Bad Taste"" and then you'll see what I mean.  Bad Taste is full of cartoony, over-the-top violence that is funny because it is extremely unrealistic.  The gore works in that movie because it is consistent and the tone is right.  In Kill Bill, the tone is consistently boring.  The gore doesn't seem funny in the context---it just seems stupid.Finally, we come to the action scenes.  These are the greatest disappointment out of everything in the movie.  There are basically two big action scenes in the movie---the fight with Lucy Liu/her henchmen and the fight with Vivica A. Fox.  The latter barely lasts a minute and a half and is so poorly shot that it fails to be exciting.  The former stretches slightly past five minutes, but because there is absolutely no suspense (Of COURSE The Bride will live---we know that there's another movie coming up), the fight is incredibly dull.What you really have here is a piece of randomly assorted scenes that ""pay tribute"" to terrible movies from the seventies.  People hail this as the final great mark of genius in the movie, but unless you have seen every bad movie from the seventies, it really doesn't mean anything.  I could make a movie that pays tribute to a bunch of math textbooks from the fifties, but unless you are a hardcore math professor with a lot of time on your hands, you probably wouldn't like my movie.  Why should any of us non-trendy, uneducated types really care about Kill Bill when we are unfamiliar with the source material?This is a terrible movie.  Do not see it.  Do not buy into the hype.  If you want to see something that's full of crazy gore and ridiculous humor, but that's actually GOOD, then check out any of Peter Jackson's early movies.",0.4794520547945205,612,0.048531018110090765,0.030551566451835606,0.020585336264968942,0.0,0.0,0.1966063012497763,0.15870941797629265,0.0373709817839035,0.022133723848084198,0.08402998609007473,0.17906302027725265,0.028536807410310724,0.0,0.15533742622357216,0.02313399534828116,0.0,0.057607937587449275,0.029718737432280973,0.0,0.05442973794947089,0.0,0.0,0.016751632558284185,0.11223467174447005,0.0,0.08992755782583672,0.06964515828755276,0.0,0.0,0.07871900718341718,0.0,0.059113566828992666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0688540133253933,0.16557319017425737,0.028843208589396523,0.2630483221329849,0.20198696769976335,0.12411772517922377,0.04735146043134282,0.04504173199068558,0.0,0.0,0.02764252530663564,0.024351216379687873,0.0,0.2867802114188536,0.0588625407363605,0.027453074594874626,0.023893852931091045,0.027560008269926994,0.09705469805852047,0.2549004907705204,0.03705141986320886,0.019784431281312246,0.0,0.09850781618973992,0.0,0.07203756850832549,0.09359452263206613,0.0,0.08012225616457964,0.10561214391801481,0.0,0.03142443559606205,0.0,0.06649161392712029,0.02482219974557415,0.0518815415661454,0.0,0.1984549634806418,0.5127914000964519,0.027959538304741696,0.0,0.12086455687427984,0.0942777229100058,0.023269442208026476,0.03901398858389752,0.025150912453482062,0.21454844640795348,0.0,0.06129761180271615,0.10151743896317161,0.04905426543461056,0.07182103805056506,0.0,0.06032658638512551,0.11739369673328957,0.02559455603965161,0.0,0.04850335304447914,0.050082035301682475,0.02765208853846485,0.0,0.025908327965087373,0.07056324740620037,0.026371950609757965,0.13549183689257654,

324806,6302642248,A3VE5XJZ4MMWWH,8,9,1172016000,My Favorite Classic Disney from Years Past,"This movie is a beautifully-made masterpiece that, very unfortunately, seems to be overlooked sometimes because of other old Disney movies that were made around that time (like Snow White).  However, of all the ""old"" Disney movies (made before the era of Eisner), this is the one that most hits the mark for me.  Not only is it an interesting story with involving characters, but the overlooked soundtrack is also quite wonderful.  ""Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee"" is an old favorite of mine, and not to mention ""Little Wooden Head"" is a catchy little tune.  This is my favorite of the oldies-but-goodies because not only does it completely hit the mark, but it doesn't rely on the old cliche of ""princess captured by evil stepmother and then saved later on by a nameless Prince Charming who has no personality whatsoever"".  Though some of those movies are good, like Snow White, some of them are dull like Cinderella, and this movie doesn't make you make that choice.Now I haven't always been a fan of this movie; this is more of a ""grown-up"" movie than many of the others that were made around that time.  This is a darker tale than the likes of Snow White, and a more intense and involving one than movies like Cinderella.  It also doesn't follow the oft-degraded Disney Formula, because there's no real cookie-cutter ""bad guy"".  And since there's no real cookie-cutter bad guy, it makes it all the more interesting to see four or five villains make their entrances and exits, more like a real-life fairy tale than others.  None of the villains ""gets what he deserves"", like in most Disney movies where they fall to their deaths.That isn't to say that the other Disney movies aren't good.  That is, however, to say that this Disney movie was ahead of its time in its innovations in realistic story developments.  Granted, the story itself isn't that realistic, but we all know the story, and can take it for granted.  And I'm not saying that the film is COMPLETELY underrated either.  Just about everybody's heard the song ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", and it truly is a wonderfully sweet tune.Speaking of which, Jiminy Cricket is a masterpiece of a character if there ever was one.  And there are plenty of other great characters in this movie too: the old puppet master, Geppetto, who just wants a real boy; Cleo and Figaro, the domesticated fish and jealous cat; and of course many great villains, including Honest John, Stromboli, Lampwick, and of course Monstro, most of whom are also used for on-the-spot comic relief.  But despite the comic relief, there are definitely some scenes that are too scary for the youngsters, including quite a few edgy scenes including the mad old puppeteer Stromboli.  However, it's not ALL dark, which is good.  There are some very fun, and some laugh-out-loud funny, scenes, both for the youngsters and for the adults.Overall, this truly is a great movie for anybody, but especially for those who have ever been through the struggle of being a real boy.  :)",0.8888888888888888,511,0.029595836727130904,0.0,0.10042900805238732,0.10335168107698693,0.054454678388036824,0.25478132260675224,0.16937603738192436,0.0,0.0,0.025622146879995485,0.10919861396624199,0.06961079538148235,0.0,0.126306605085616,0.05643153396211779,0.029984358786827085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02800291516913008,0.0,0.1634512858504519,0.0,0.0,0.08226124514776151,0.08494389006378686,0.0,0.029015547569002872,0.024002740666158078,0.029854489102484106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027992985596186227,0.07343422890597401,0.0,0.25328788071600794,0.1478140838543215,0.07569113676977302,0.05775300606874496,0.16480772064738694,0.0,0.0739871289217669,0.033714671464131894,0.11880148443544453,0.10663840669286766,0.15302713735908113,0.21537806699528467,0.0,0.029142540077213567,0.1008420845124048,0.11837439679608604,0.34361932594017247,0.06778558222036773,0.0723912442899002,0.06672411935264173,0.03003667919848954,0.10320375457545336,0.02928727782515669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03220290743447141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137406950988627,0.12655639161414847,0.13411793755208404,0.2823904276694881,0.3837894541659299,0.06820264341093998,0.03591942128459785,0.03685362300903853,0.1724811184418609,0.028380967024343846,0.1586135604496485,0.09202720167416158,0.09812910954513526,0.07293373956416091,0.0,0.03095436347219139,0.05982986086460077,0.043798869228247564,0.0,0.0,0.03579529975480109,0.0,0.06952627220407007,0.029578965645567574,0.030541698844822125,0.06745267084173627,0.08588680994565556,0.0,0.021515913229273726,0.0,0.04721568583428117,

1078971,B000R4SMCW,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,0,2,1200700800,"Between Tom & Jerry, who will win?","*Fracture* is a classic legal cat-and-mouse game.  Hopkins plays Crawford, an engineer who has shot his wife to death after discovering that she was having an affair.  He waited for the police to arrive where he admitted to murdering his wife.It turned out that the wife didn't die.  However, she's left in a vegetative state in a hospital.Gosling plays Beachum, an up-and-coming lawyer with a 97% winning rate, who is soon transferring from the D.A.'s office to a prestigious law firm.  Before transferring, Beachum hears about this case involving Crawford.  He believes that this is a simple open-and-shut case.However, Crawford masterminded all of this from the beginning.  As soon as Beachum takes this case, it goes downhill. The confession is no good as Crawford, representing himself in court, points out that the detective who took his confession is the man whom his wife was having an affair with.From there, you think that the story plot would build up to a bigger climax.  Alas, it doesn't.  So, now, you're left guessing, for the rest of the movie, who will win at the end.  The cat?  Or the mouse?",0.0,187,0.07359632009788068,0.09266168119450405,0.06243450296643004,0.0,0.2708261961588147,0.11180607405980585,0.0,0.17001704341959994,0.06713070068245694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10161406539008684,0.20424196687691049,0.0,0.06818667307120478,0.0,0.0,0.0721533081288435,0.0,0.2227185421317309,0.0,0.0,0.28847958937115964,0.0,0.0,0.13695732950212736,0.0,0.20995133108255315,0.12252368163148983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436205817236763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08358840467482592,0.0,0.0813792643068999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469256832812954,0.0,0.14565804599400817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906181169145634,0.0,0.06722213672781728,0.0,0.07867732202963253,0.0,0.25079415849403075,0.4595133169276921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07148514232324962,0.0,0.1577704928479449,0.0,0.20334902235261923,0.0,0.0,0.15394916950850407,0.0,0.10891517037909447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28476767257163155,0.07857892425805027,0.10700775597726192,0.07998507322794829,0.11741180897633617,

At the time I (a lad of around 14) liked it so much I bought the novelisation. But time has not been kind to this story, at least in fan opinion, and it's often ranked among the worst Who stories ever made. I don't think that's true, though, and am looking forward to deciding for myself when it's released in May :~).Upon watching most of it again for the first time in ages, Season 24 hasn't been anywhere near as bad as its reputation (well, except for Time and the Rani, that is) and actually has been very fun in places, Paradise Towers & Delta and the Bannermen especially. I hope this final story of that season continues that trend for ne. If nothing else it features the return of Sabalom Glitz, the farewell of Mel (who I've grown rather fond of over the years, at least more than I used to be) and the introduction of one of my very favourite companions ever, the redoubtable Ace.

617873,B00005JMEW,A2CMYX10636NG2,3,5,1066089600,"""silly caucasian director likes to play with samurai movie""","Ok. So that's not EXACTLY what Lucy Liu said in the new super-gory, super-shticky, super-kung-fu-rip-off, super-slick Tarantino film ""Kill Bill"", but if you want to know what she REALLY says, go see it.And you really should. If you're 18 or older and accompanied only by people who are not squeamish upon the sight of blood. And when we say blood, we mean several gallons per shot. One truly feels sympathy for whoever had to clean up between takes. Let's just say if it was ketchup, McDonald's would never have to reorder until somewhere around 3042.Of course, you should be expecting (and i hesitate to say this for fear of repeating every single other reviewer who has had anything to say about this film) what is essentially a parody (homage? spoof? takeoff?) of spaghetti westerns-slash-kung fu movies. Well, now that i've said that (...), and it's probably nothing you didn't already know, I'll move on to my personal feelings about this movie.I loved it. I loved the pastishe-y feel of the opening credits combined with the fabulous music (a lot of which was taken from movies...the use of the green hornets theme was great) and the eye-popping color and gorgeous shots. Toss in a couple of thousand insider kung-fu jokes that I probably didn't get, but you might, and Monty Python-style hacking of limbs (""it's only a flesh wound!!"") and you have KILL BILL.The plot is so irrelevant it's hilarious...like most kung fu movies, come to think of it. Uma Thurman looks like she's having a blast portraying the traditional revenge-obsessed, student-of-samurai, ex-bad-guy with near-superhero powers. Lucy Liu and the rest of her posse of villains (all with snake-inspired code names, of course) engage with Thurman in some of the bloodiest battle-to-the-death scenes you'll ever see in an American cinema.Some of this movie is hilarious ...like the bit when Thurman goes to get her sword specially made for her by the master in Japan and orders sake... but most of it is not really laugh out loud funny. Tarantino has an edgy sense of humor to say the least, and this film is his ""who cares if you like it, i think it's AWESOME"" message to the world.Some of the best cinematography and marriage of music-to-movie I have EVER seen is right here in this film. Some of the bits will take your breath away with their beauty-- right before someone gets their guts yoinked out of them. I did mention to leave all your squeamish friends at home, correct?But wait, I most definitely did not spend enough time gushing over how BEAUTIFUL a lot of this movie is. It is VERY beautiful. The last fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii (who chops first and asks questions later) is filmed in a magical wintery Japanese garden with anime-style snow.The stunts equally deserve accolades as Tarantino used incredibly minimal (by today's standards) computer magic. This is the REAL thing...people actually doing stunts instead of the nerd at the computer creating the double-back-flip out of a sequence of 0's and 1's.

643515,B00005JOX2,A2HMB1IEBSGSHJ,2,2,1158364800,Old-School New-School,"This thoroughly entertaining noir epic begins with a bet that leads to a quarter-century of intrigue and murder.  Bodies pile up mercilessly, including the horse that incurs the film's title!  Josh Hartnett is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea in the form of Morgan Freeman as The Boss, and Sir Ben Kingsley as The Rabbi, two crime bosses living fearfully across from one another.  Bruce Willis is the worldly assassin playing both sides, and Lucy Liu actually pulls off something she has never before achieved, likeability!  Lucy Liu doesn't perform any martial arts, wear thigh-high leather boots, or wave any whips; instead she is utterly adorable as the coroner who lives across the hall.The cast runs deep, Danny Aiello as a bookie, and Stanley Tucci as a cop who crosses the line.  A plethora of special features really flesh out the DVD, including what is probably the movie's best scene.  Edited out of the the finished product is a hilarious aside with the two ex-Mossad agents, bodyguards to the Rabbi's son.  Lucky # Slevin's twists and turns are somewhat overhyped, but it is tough to fool today's audience, bombarded as we are by twisty movies.  Homage is paid throughout the film to those who have gone before, and it is just as interesting to watch Lucky # Slevin and pick out the subculture references, as it is to view the movie for just what it is, great entertainment.",1.0,241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2433730494511994,0.09823081657093963,0.37008334890259953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222625879212725,0.042730565685631126,0.05727375936693131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07062395244619807,0.0,0.1136834044629013,0.0,0.04147268803776713,0.055572774917125645,0.0,0.0,0.05747443645569142,0.0,0.05889719356140123,0.04872195017712055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037265107470587956,0.0,0.34275751191232784,0.13335126145603332,0.0,0.11722990817576168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08874915774774218,0.0728641754938147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13285628631771337,0.0,0.04898110937424636,0.0,0.060969937047993035,0.0,0.17834629522527384,0.0,0.0,0.06612062681521369,0.0,0.0,0.15559746904714514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08188715101192644,0.6059159681950882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0321961650010212,0.0,0.1991873200098423,0.0,0.15175695401085051,0.0628326979753178,0.0,0.0,0.0705553701872608,0.0,0.07265906987394305,0.0,0.0,0.12008169487961858,0.0,0.0,0.17433729478000656,0.0,0.08734812969503417,0.0,0.0,

828053,B00029LO5E,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,1,2,1208822400,"Once Again, Ben Affleck's Character Learns That True Success Lies With Love And Family Rather Than In Fame And Fortune","""Jersey Girl"" is a great romantic comedy starring Ben Affleck as Ollie Trinke, a successful workaholic.  However, this film is sadder than most romantic comedies because Ollie loses his wife (Jennifer Lopez of ""The Wedding Planner and ""Maid in Manhattan) while she is giving birth to their daughter, Gertrude.  He later loses his career when he insults Will Smith who has a cameo in the movie.  Knocked off his lofty pedestal, Ollie is forced to humble himself by moving back home with his alcoholic father (super comedian George Carlin) and earn a living by cleaning streets.  Eventually he meets spunky video store clerk, played by the beautiful Liv Tyler (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy).Affleck and Tyler have been romantically paired together before.  They were lovers in the great disaster film ""Armageddon.""  Interesting enough, Liv Tyler's megastar father, Steve Tyler, sung the lead song for ""Armageddon,"" which was a very romantic ballad titled ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.""  In ""Jersey Girl,"" Liv Tyler sings part of a song from Sweeney Todd at Gertrude's school on talent night.  I didn't realize she could sing; it was a genuine treat.""Jersey Girl"" reminded me of ""Raising Helen,"" which starred Kate Hudson as Helen Harris.  Helen is a fun-loving single who is forced to become a parent overnight when her sister and brother-in-law are accidentally killed.  Likewise, Ollie Trinke is forced to become a single parent when he isn't ready for the additional responsibility.Ollie Trinke reminded me of Drew Latham (also played by Ben Affleck) of ""Surviving Christmas.""  Drew is a rich, successful advertiser who learns that love and family are more important than wealth.  This lonely man tries to ""buy"" a family for the holidays.  He soon learns that you can't buy love.  Ollie Trinke also learns that money doesn't buy happiness.  It comes from being with your family.The ending for ""Jersey Girl"" reminded me of the one for ""Life or Something Like It.""  Angelina Jolie (in one of her better roles) is a successful reporter who is faced with a career decision that will take her away from friends and family.Overall, the movie was great.  The foul language could've been toned down.  The movie had some really sad, grim moments, but it had some hilarious ones as well.  It is a must see for anyone who loves good romantic comedies or is a fan of one of its many star actors.",0.5,400,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135392767164294,0.0,0.14818005581902916,0.07974505484730128,0.11266442899437933,0.04448519929684705,0.0,0.05998127712566258,0.11470871992950198,0.0,0.03468922913611355,0.18598233187764224,0.0494099714777689,0.0,0.05972984783760724,0.0,0.0,0.09228966673177359,0.0,0.2020084061816806,0.13534410499120184,0.0,0.04518495576725272,0.13997548572245377,0.11040280686033271,0.047813507968898834,0.03955311301251452,0.245979823267916,0.17821303949467407,0.0,0.1911654711746851,0.0,0.0,0.18151379431849843,0.0,0.3339060088179208,0.13532036114003657,0.06236413017038444,0.0,0.04526329229625431,0.11241469755871451,0.06096014851837617,0.16667099342710842,0.048942000054131185,0.05857499094321271,0.10807158129141362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.269636154138138,0.037233675818826764,0.1192905054609863,0.0,0.09899237619423576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05367758505915797,0.053065825057346104,0.0,0.1263160496513336,0.0,0.0,0.09977720064159823,0.0,0.11050367153452309,0.13295410904009863,0.30450362167045797,0.056194142579488286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046767809215263176,0.05227453122157506,0.0,0.16170285775442667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04929556339449784,0.10826148866706739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05144091135106363,0.05728471885928593,0.0,0.15098516658641106,0.1111524367115606,0.23588213996846435,0.10414308418099709,0.10636552209116576,0.0,0.03890237751890904,

966859,B000E33VWW,AY12DBB0U420B,2,2,1281830400,Simply Outstanding!,"A couple things from late 1959 seem to stick in my mind. One was the brutal murder of an entire family in western Kansas. That one created real shock waves in that we lived in Boulder, Colorado. which was only a couple hundred miles away and the killers remained free for a while. A second thing was that I had enrolled in graduate school far away in Seattle. I knew no one, had no friends and nothing to do other than school work. It was one of those periods in my life when I lost myself in reading. One of my favored authors was Truman Capote and I read a couple of his books. ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" come to mind. I remember being startled when I learned of Capote going to Kansas to research the situation in order to white a book about the grisly crime and the convicted killers. It seemed totally out of character and I couldn't imagine what type of book would come out of this situation. Well, the resulting book was the very highly acclaimed ""In Cold Blood"" and Capote was informally crowned America's greatest living author.I never got around to reading ""In Cold Blood"" as I was then deeply into my latter days of graduate school and the early years of my career as a professor. Likewise, when the movie ""Capote"" came out, I just wasn't into going to movies. Lately, my wife and I have been watching movies late at night on DVDs. So, I was scratching through the ultra-bargain DVD shelf in a Ross store and there was the ""Capote"" DVD and I snapped it up immediately. Strangely, my wife refused to watch it in that she didn't like the idea of a family getting murdered. I tried to explain, but it was no use. I watched it last night while she was at a baby shower. The movie was simply outstanding!Several things stand out about the movie ""Capote."" One was the directing and the magnificent capturing of the stark beauty of western Kansas and the depiction of the people. Outstanding! Secondly, I've seen Truman Capote on talk shows many times and, of course, he's a completely unique and easily recognized personality. Well, Philip Seymour Hoffman did an absolutely stunning job of portraying Capote in the movie. There were times when he was so close in looks and voice, that I'd almost swear that it actually was Capote. Surely, this was acting at it's finest!The story of ""Capote"" unfolded in a somewhat grim documentary style, but it fit the situation perfectly and I felt no lapse of attention at any point in the movie. All acting was excellent! The story was completely believable and made for compelling viewing. The movie left me with deep emotional feelings, even for the hapless killers. The movie is a stunning portrait of of a tragic event and it's aftermath.Gary Peterson",1.0,488,0.06168039033541797,0.0,0.026162887684095706,0.0,0.056744228073888445,0.29672815917391493,0.0,0.047496566802287754,0.14065403732405124,0.0,0.0,0.03626879238349698,0.0,0.04387239087854823,0.0,0.0,0.03660834055399155,0.0,0.07251113102276359,0.034588677646964765,0.0,0.0,0.06387135126280988,0.02852888165940631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06981468336554747,0.0,0.025011937102140582,0.06221944519033084,0.0,0.0,0.030221507088515776,0.0,0.0,0.3252175426701482,0.07331642457135877,0.017595825491532095,0.17114326047624398,0.0,0.030090617053735884,0.028622844922257223,0.0,0.03854896073531182,0.035132206517947434,0.0,0.0,0.15946117102962484,0.07481121621057141,0.0,0.2125748774617675,0.14010932668919154,0.0,0.34101601690023065,0.04709042028460975,0.15086987557862844,0.03476476914982066,0.0,0.10754296161627298,0.12207465156486,0.03965125064350419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07987763410355066,0.0,0.05633824662752404,0.0,0.06593873072565293,0.03493923324192711,0.12611294887446378,0.39992590102835074,0.0,0.0,0.038403135438100554,0.059911031907802066,0.0,0.03305649511188243,0.0,0.17042492146827287,0.0,0.0,0.032255841237948654,0.031172705183727317,0.4335837513901273,0.03622035807119055,0.0,0.03730031492952251,0.06505868899788009,0.036224753904172624,0.030822614740674582,0.12730330442244167,0.03514436088633006,0.0,0.0,0.02242055088086101,0.03351737241172815,0.0,
1048788,B000MNP2K8,A2G5VFHRIJ346X,1,4,1173398400,"The name's Craig, Daniel Craig.","This was one hell of a film.  If you were one of those that wrote off the Bond franchise as old or out of touch, then check out Casino Royale.  It basically restarts the franchise, wiping clean the slate and ignoring every Bond film that came before it.  Which is fine, because, let's face it, if all the Bond films were indeed sequels, Bond would be in his 70s.  And although I though Pierce was an excellent Bond, he's not that old.  The character is very much like The Simpsons, he never ages, even though the world around him does.So, Casino Royale reintroduces how Bond became 007, and the movie rocks.  My only problem with Daniel Craig is that he doesn't have the sophisticated English gentleman trait, who is just as smooth with the ladies as he is with his liquor.  This Bond is gritty, from the streets.  As everyone who's read the Amazon review knows, when asked how he likes his martini, he replies ""do I look like I give a damn?""  Now, the Bond we all know and love would never say that.  In Diamonds are Forever, Bond even knew the vintage of the whiskey that the Sherry he was drinking was based on.  That's class.  This Bond wouldn't know nor care about that...YET.  I get the sense that this film will set up the next film, in which many of the traits that are missing will slowly appear.  Time will tell.So, if you want a hard edged, violent, sexy (PG-13 rated) adventure, check this out.  It's definitely a great film, even if you don't like Bond, James Bond.[...]",0.25,271,0.050167137043690115,0.0,0.08511730647417975,0.0,0.04615235816020034,0.10161722999583807,0.08202998238857757,0.1545234563476441,0.0,0.04343143820306173,0.06169991500644134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05955006534579601,0.06144128153869033,0.0,0.16879415862051486,0.2373350846378934,0.0,0.0,0.046407368958844814,0.05674425754039338,0.0,0.04799539670780414,0.0,0.0,0.04068642463213235,0.3542390039476359,0.0,0.06561081073795316,0.14748218805345367,0.1219762358232868,0.1898007422616373,0.09335734598052137,0.0,0.17173669311045192,0.11135814615603151,0.0,0.048947813113859324,0.1396806514342663,0.05781785264688857,0.06270683390892041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037056048708456475,0.0,0.056757191961128925,0.049398765621469026,0.0,0.04013067541415035,0.1386810067259222,0.038300528823120225,0.08180568338125926,0.0565511641138185,0.0509143977100883,0.0,0.14893232049875169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09164431431106826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34190907649170044,0.457795551512535,0.0,0.0,0.062469622774884076,0.0,0.0,0.13443087109564097,0.05199764278447474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0524699405773537,0.05070802452677119,0.14848465986554762,0.0,0.0,0.06067568641074734,0.0,0.11785218502036976,0.0,0.0517704434452,0.1143372770055266,0.0970563394780733,0.16069062923621116,0.10941320337163779,0.10904409689885079,0.12005113102726393,

786343,B0000VCZMK,A7K2V3AJIAC63,2,2,1065225600,v,"v saw Jason X.......why?I never saw a Nightmare on Elm Street movie. I never saw ANOTHER Jason movie. But I saw Freddy vs Jason, only because I was interested in finding out who won, and how. When I went, I was expecting to see a scary, interesting movie. After being freaked out by a Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I was ready for the worst. The first time I was truly scared was during a scene in the boiler room where Freddy has one of the main characters cornered, in her dream. The last time I was truly scared was during a scene in the boiler room where Freddy has one of the main characters cornered, in her dream. I was disturbed by a few of the ways that the characters were murdered, but wasn't enough to get me jumping in my seat.I did like the idea. The plot. I only wish the screenwriters and the director tried to take advantage of the good ideas in the movie and made it better....But throughout the film I was constantly asking myself, what is with all of this useless stuff, like profanity, the drugs, the sexually situations. Why could we not have a plain horror movies without all the add-ons. A scary movie, like The Ring, with the slasher film quality like scenes in the summer blockbuster 28 Days Later...(another film I had a problem with)Did I hate Freddy vs Jason? The answer to that is no. I enjoyed it very much. After struggling through the first thirty minutes or so, my money was finally paid off with the last hour. When Freddy finally takes command. If the movie had a little more detailed plotline, and some more non bloody action taking place instead of all of the teen partying scenes, etc, this would have robally gained  fourth star. It wouldn't have gained a fifth star because it wasn't excellant. It wouldn't even be great with all the things I mentioned above. My next stop though is to watch the orignal Freddy and Jason films. They have to be better...To watch this movie was not torture. I have no idea what the critics were talking about, saying that it was a terrible dry film. It was good....I liked it. In the word of the 60's generation...mellow out, man.ENJOY!Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence/gore, gruesome images, sexuality, drug use and language.",1.0,398,0.03893167212686783,0.0980340915467231,0.1321087573759279,0.0,0.0,0.11828845277317089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06740900963303396,0.09576312314551398,0.0,0.0,0.08307464630900599,0.07423253473402834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04366363604804607,0.1473450907318548,0.08857707246953817,0.05375276198570271,0.0,0.04403577640321023,0.07214005254337481,0.0372463161810467,0.08813181458963183,0.07633666822485308,0.15787133142690726,0.0,0.09484202440655241,0.0,0.0,0.047329179022176184,0.036823210883705444,0.21734692062552322,0.0,0.06663721533985346,0.17283660540671558,0.0,0.0,0.14453024149707833,0.0,0.0,0.04434976944251758,0.07813836254857409,0.0,0.20129866214309458,0.047219638609351695,0.04404581402259417,0.11500615701702162,0.08843475760962617,0.06228596605354684,0.17219506799841633,0.02972271726665962,0.0634844288750204,0.08777185661420124,0.03951157580429281,0.0,0.1155773403154621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04236112819954233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03555979678432624,0.03982482872171122,0.0,0.0,0.07960046863895708,0.5983450265745998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03733357880780268,0.06259418701928493,0.08070443320264309,0.15059726406199714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03935142209447113,0.37449729866669274,0.0914468340473926,0.0,0.04708671988514396,0.0,0.09145793236421271,0.07781895832054478,0.08035180195018067,0.0,0.03765976901475969,0.0,0.14151491763440113,0.0423112547177976,0.0,

It saved me those odd nights when I woke up at 2:30 in the morning and couldn't sleep...I'd put on the dvd and watch a couple of episodes.Why have only the first three seasons been released? Why have they released up to Season Five of the Dukes Of Hazzard but not this?I feel that I have to dock 1 star from MTM Season 3 because of the ""downer"" episodes that just aren't as much fun as most of the others:  like Murray feeling life has passed him by, orthe one with Joseph Campanella.  Plus that fact that for the first time in the series, Mary makes an ass of herself a couple of times.  For instance, when she goes to Lou's office to ask for an additional $50 per week, she gets all choked up and turns away and just stands there like a fool.  And then she complains that Lou doesn't seem concerned.  In the business world you have to speak up and say what's on your mind.  That was embarrassing to watch.  Also, in season 3 Mary goes out with too many losers who don't treat her right.  She comes across as a bit pathetic when she starts getting all upset about the anchovies on the pizza brought by David Campanella.  I especially hate it the way Mary fawns all over Murray when he's in a bad mood and being unresponsive to her (she does that in another episode (from a different season) as well--the one where she's pestering him and then starts saying ""Murray...Murray Murray Murray Murray..."").",0.0,270,0.05172694653042822,0.0,0.13164569338398432,0.060211924740058244,0.09517467822517992,0.20955347792668472,0.0,0.15932793926889807,0.04718260587123602,0.0,0.0636183045823537,0.06083210155260887,0.0,0.03679264681685372,0.09862978251980271,0.0,0.0,0.06335162961651532,0.060809916683059684,0.0,0.0,0.11768879272697931,0.10712869855820042,0.09570055754473035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050712730019794504,0.16780582951167763,0.05217901341109182,0.1260127823261312,0.13530159777323858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2246067518719843,0.0,0.0,0.057410261093075045,0.0,0.10093942213672535,0.09601575870651825,0.0,0.06465653086550101,0.058925754463207844,0.0,0.06212674676677704,0.0,0.0,0.058521901124908474,0.0,0.0,0.04137842866276976,0.22878865942699844,0.11847413605416322,0.08434920666216833,0.11661893481389672,0.0,0.0,0.051187654130248283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997830730688474,0.4689137439059355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24677786080928327,0.32296751716833344,0.0,0.0,0.12882388860413876,0.050243111744676286,0.04960362422881896,0.027722126040986526,0.05361436682500765,0.20009252621820098,0.06373598559626292,0.0,0.2164053976877992,0.0,0.038275345744590655,0.1215017294847177,0.0642992920780662,0.0,0.05456008479895586,0.0,0.05169745962853783,0.2135204133825086,0.0,0.050037020034142475,0.0,0.07521007116137497,0.0,0.04126126385723111,

They both gave great performances but the film itself drags a bit as the script doesn't really gives them much direction to move on quicker and as you are watching the film you will see why. so, you get to really know each character and it makes you want to root for them to succeed. Some good surrounding supporting actors with a very small appearance by Toby McGuire (Mr. Spiderman). She is an unsecured single mother and housewife of what she wants in life due to the previous experience she had with her son's father played nicely by Clark Gregg, (from Avengers and other Marvel series) now x-husband with a teenager that excels at doing right by his mom. He is a convict trying to proof he was wrongly accused of the charges they accused him of and trying to begin a life he felt missed on and wants to waste no more time while getting desperate trying to start that life he felt robbed of. There is a good and happy ending and a nice different way kind of love story, that you should appreciate although it completely caught me by surprise when I saw it to what Imagined the film would be like before it came out and waiting in anticipation to see it and that was a good thing!

His closest friend on the street is River Phoenix, a narcoleptic prostitute who dreams of finding security by reconnecting with his trailer-park-trash mother.  Together the two go off on a road-trip spree complete with a Falstaff figure and interspersed with takes on other teenage boys plying their bodies on the street in order to survive.Reeves gives one of his better performances here and the supporting cast is very good, but the heart of the film belongs to River Phoenix, who works miracles with the pathos of his role.  It is largely due to his performance that the film is able to hold our attention.  But the adoption of Shakespeare's lines, particularly since the film skips in and out of them from portion to portion of the film, seems extremely out of place, and the film as a whole never seems to find a cohesive visual style. Worse still, one is never entirely certain what point Van Sant is trying to make, and the uncertainty doesn't seem intentional on the director's part. Final thought: interesting, but slightly pretentious and and not entirely successful.",0.651685393258427,255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10151534888411873,0.30733205906413275,0.0,0.042485647557436994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11773147377959536,0.05260031853836929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31322109915806323,0.0,0.0,0.051038131511054116,0.0,0.051117609775175384,0.05278462071983616,0.0,0.05409128327857635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3243974169742525,0.0,0.0,0.10267301526838024,0.06558149323668859,0.2518312680332559,0.030617506636602253,0.07055236009168236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054328024898549085,0.0,0.0441351176626975,0.30503860133247196,0.2527340985976881,0.13495300381498812,0.0,0.0,0.06413140530811128,0.10919569499982792,0.0,0.0,0.06072529673065233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07520529951302307,0.45047916389481024,0.06357227097499271,0.06696160350884864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2744009629487808,0.0,0.06968692303086625,0.0,0.11153585659028613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05514161695610754,0.0,0.0,0.16011166963558207,0.0,0.20055167918409697,0.0,0.0,

609430,B00005JLYQ,A33H0WC9MI8OVW,1,3,1065744000,Delightful and Surreal Movie with theme of redemption,"If you didn't read the book, this movie is about the strangest thing.  Stanley (the protagonist) is sent to a youth camp where to build character the inmates have to dig a round 5 ft by ft deep hole every day of their incarceration.  Stanley thinks he is there because of an old family curse involving his pig stealing great great grandfather who forgot to pay off the fortuneteller Madame Zeroni for her advice before coming to America.  Soon a plot develops where Stanley (Shia LeBeouf) befriends the great great great great grandson of Madame Zeroni (Khleo Thomas), and together they discover the secret that the Warden (played by Sigourney Weaver) wants the boys to find.  Stanley breaks the curse, and without giving away the ending, the Warden and Mr. Sir (the overseer played by Jon Voight) get their just desserts.The desert scenery is dreary and hot.  And the flashbacks to the times before are done nicely, with a subplot complete with bandits, a onion-picker, and a schoolteacher turned killer.  It's hard to follow the moving between the plot and subplot so it's best to see the movie a second time.  Then read the book.  Very delightful feel-good story with a happy ending.",0.3333333333333333,203,0.06785487101464381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242457701452449,0.24052881569460494,0.05547589719404297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0834538309557202,0.0,0.08157962332663253,0.0,0.19407228591620235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04684343789980117,0.0,0.07675092706350506,0.06286724526458386,0.3895045615302058,0.0,0.0,0.05503148591190356,0.06844788765171472,0.08265112929009029,0.0,0.06649362801395396,0.0,0.06417998735621952,0.0,0.0,0.15485796540927502,0.07531018400817602,0.0,0.06620564259820694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10024225234279864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11254596986915749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383214573080271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061977955024495074,0.0,0.07253949016741726,0.0,0.04624580482612647,0.6517929744349054,0.15636934391061286,0.0,0.08449491929411124,0.06590839195976647,0.06506951888075245,0.03636559690714199,0.07033076934673986,0.3374733817643531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06858646250183469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06563804299518507,0.0,0.14798968487310304,0.0,0.05412609722258865,

668425,B00005NGAG,A2TKYCFV4XCMCL,0,0,1367280000,Movie is NOT the book!,"Beware - this film is NOT from the popular novel Beautiful Creatures, which is a well-written teen supernatural romance book.  Instead, this is a British murder movie, whose off-beat humor is more than offset by the occasional extreme brutality and misogynist viewpoints.Two women, both exploited and abused in different ways by their boyfriends, somehow accidentally team up and save each other from their boyfriends, killing said boyfriends in the process.  The boyfriend villains were too awful to endure,  and the women were sympathetic but it was too hard to watch their continued bad treatment by the men around them.  Instead of feeling empowered when they defended themselves, I ended up feeling sickened by not so much the actual violence killing the men, but the threatened horrific violence against the women!  I had to stop the film, and then deleted it from my account.To be a fan of this movie you will need a strong stomach, a thick skin about women's issues, and a high tolerance for violence.  If you can take all this, there is a decidedly masculine sense of humor built into the interactions between the various characters.

I was not aware that ths was one of the Steven Spielberg movies and have never heard of it before.  When I saw that one of the actors in the film is John Malkovich, it was a final push for me to see this movie.  And what a wonderful movie this is.  For Spielberg's fans - this film can go head to head with his films such as ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's list"".  It is a story about an upper class British boy played by Christian Bale (I did not know he was a child actor) who in the confusion of the WWII and Japanese invasion of China (film is set in Shanghai) finds himself fending on his own in order to survive.Perhaps not many people understand events of the WWII and impact it had on China.  Most people, when they think of WWII think of Europe, Pearl Harbor and atom bomb - but never China.  It is fascinating film and I enjoyed it very much.  Thios may be one of the most overlooked films about WWII and young man's coming of age stories.  See this film.

CRANFORD has them all - in spades.  Cranford is a small town in Industrial Revolution England that has kept itself well away from what Cranford's leading ladies call with horror, modernism.  These ladies are led by Dame Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Imelda Staunton and other women of such formidable talent that they have been honoured by the Queen with the title, Dame.  However, time is a march, and leading its parade that threatens Cranford's way of life is THE RAILWAY!CRANFORD is a series of films made in co-production by BBC and PBS. , from the novels of Elizabeth Gaskell.  The photography, the colour, costumes, music and dialogue are nothing short of flawless,as is the direction and editing  The performances draw - almost seduce -  the viewer into the heart of CRANFORD's charm.  You might think it silly, but these Ladies of CRANFORD believe whole heartedly in the niceties of their carefully constructed customs for good living: In CRANFORD, one ""receives"" between noon and three pm.  No person of respectability stays for more than fifteen minutes, and one must not return a visit until the third day.  Naturally they hear tales of society in London, but immediately remind their guest that ""This is not London, this is CRANFORD.  The delicacy of courting, the rigid customs surrounding death, are held to be sacrosanct, and all are lived out with grace and favour.If you haven't yet bought CRANFORD, as I have, from AMAZON, Do so immediately, then unplug your phones,silence your devices, and set yourself up for a genuine heart-filling treat.Peace, P the G.",1.0,282,0.0,0.0,0.0993056074511164,0.0,0.0,0.3260287856626259,0.19140730757905663,0.0901405738367894,0.0,0.05067107421378527,0.0,0.06883212783409691,0.0,0.08326249149430688,0.16740086957494943,0.0,0.06947653371423178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12121718772910363,0.16242919879275625,0.0,0.05422737963532354,0.05599580417140699,0.0,0.11476391663108135,0.09493698239461128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05535971116133202,0.2178383770974246,0.0695711819554676,0.33393946420192905,0.032480140663313554,0.07484445441965275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05873628449960442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664760421538594,0.09364020701558945,0.38831496489690426,0.0,0.09544196612464449,0.0,0.0,0.06803287707475407,0.05791933966926521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918115059686993,0.0,0.0,0.053460304837432734,0.0,0.0,0.06630884600469773,0.15956091629548116,0.4497734859488733,0.13487945495114895,0.07103525204787198,0.07288275550382706,0.17055174170178206,0.11225398816773727,0.06273572258015463,0.060665189215131164,0.06468762376526102,0.0,0.0,0.06121621486622944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275528839212983,0.0,0.06173527850707368,0.0,0.058496189660193834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12765141513599257,0.0,0.09337506073043216,

In four DVDs (at an incredible price), one can see all of the wit and grandeur of what I believe to be the greatest television show of all time. Season four has it all, from the greatest episode of all time (""Last Exit to Springfield"", or, more aptly, Union Chief Homer), to ""Duffless"" an homage to drunk driving, to ""Selma's Choice"", which introduced us to a later Simpsons tradition - plotlines which have no purpose to ANYTHING in the show, and yet leave us in stitches (Homer's insistence on finishing a 10ft hoagie?). There are other great episodes (""Lisa the Beauty Queen"", ""New Kid on the Block"", ""Itchy and Scratchy - the Movie"", ""The Front"", just to name a few). Of course, any fan will buy this DVD right out of the gate, but for the rest of you that might be wavering, that might be wondering, ""Are these old episodes really THAT good?"", please do yourself a favor and pick up this incredible set.

556271,B00004X13Q,AUVGR56UHGVQ,3,4,983664000,CLEVER satire.  BEAUTIFUL color.,"I saw this movie 3x in the theatres in NYC when it came out... and bought the DVD as soon as it came out.  This is a hilarious satire on a puritanical view of homosexual life, as the main characters try to &quot;cure&quot; themselves.  There is a very JohnWaters-esque feel to the colors and costumes.  The dialog is witty and funny, especially if you are/know a homosexual.  &quot;But you're a vegetarian,&quot; is an accusation, the main character gets as proof that she's a lesbian - to me, a very funny lesbian stereo-type.  This movie gently makes fun of stereo-types, but also makes it clear that it's ok to be who you are.  The filming/costuming/sets are beautiful - and the color is breathtaking.  Clea DuVall steals the picture, but sadly, it is Natasha Lyonne that solely gets the credit for it on the movie posters (and even on the Amazon search).

They drove from Chicago, illinois to ???,Nebraska spent time there and drove back all in the same night??? Thats a long drive! it would take atleast 2 to 4 days to do all of that! come on that doesnt make any sense and the other part that did'nt make any sense was at the end where that big monster comes up from beneath the ground.now come on guys,does that have anything to do with ""Children of The Corn""? now, on the other hand if it was called monsters of the corn, then it would make complete sense!

584120,B00005JK8K,A3ODFGVZK65QNY,0,0,1024012800,"""Wind Talkers"" is much more than just another war movie!","""Wind Talkers"" is the latest war movie to hit the market. Appropriately, it opened nationwide on Flag Day. While the premise of the movie is about the Navajo code talkers, the movie is much more. It is not just about the unbreakable code that the Native American soldiers spoke, aiding the big guns to do their jobs in helping save soldiers lives. The story is one that needed to be told decades ago - but better late than never.The movie is graphic, though not quite on the same scale as ""Saving Private Ryan."" The plots are similar but ""Wind Talkers"" evolves relationships better than  ""Saving Private Ryan"" did. In this particular story, 2 sergeants are responsible for the safety of their assigned code speakers and must protect them at all costs - and kill them if capture is imminent so that the code cannot be broken. I'll not give away the details of the movie but I'll let you know while some of it is predictable, it's not exactly who and what you think.I appreciate that there were no gratuitous love affairs to detract from the movie as was present in ""Pearl Harbor."" While the graphic presentation of the harsh realities of war aren't as intense as others (Saving Private Ryan), the story line and character development blow it out of the water. I don't appreciate some of the hand-to-hand combat as it seemed a bit unrealistic and over the edge, which is too bad because a lot of the bullets flying and bombs exploding were realistic in the film. This stops me from rating a full five stars. However, as I stated earlier, it is not what makes this movie.The story contains racism, religious issues, moral and ethical decision-making, duty and other elements. However, it transcends and develops into much more that help erase racial lines and helps evolve morals and ethics into something higher that involves deep compassion and true honor.All of the characters were cast splendidly. My favorite actor happened to be Adam Beach, who plays the main Navajo character. He's my favorite Native American actor (Smoke Signals and others) and this movie helps establish him even more than before. What surprised me most was that I actually liked Nicholas Cage. I normally do not like his roles in movies and had a sour taste about him. However, he restores himself in my opinion in his role. Beautifully done! John Woo has done an excellent job putting this flick together and is probably among his best works.Do I recommend ""Wind Talkers""? Absolutely! Please don't take young children to the movie! It's not the greatest flick I've ever seen but I feel it belongs in the top 40 and that says a lot considering the long history of Hollywood.",0.0,461,0.1051848241062785,0.0,0.05948813929784131,0.0,0.03225569540303429,0.3018344421327466,0.05733042105146334,0.1619937227239627,0.03198135873290218,0.0910621665353005,0.043121819646414296,0.0,0.04215338904908997,0.09975530726674935,0.0,0.0,0.12485789538796857,0.08588212353548205,0.0,0.039323183641566915,0.03317450506845357,0.0,0.02420469207465159,0.06486784282600692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0396854664824427,0.03437415083673034,0.0,0.07073605687583977,0.0,0.09171025753282384,0.10307470137739488,0.0,0.03316274169789147,0.17399218505113187,0.08335199329644286,0.22004780657121156,0.19456938855580755,0.0,0.034209427500214225,0.03254074638845815,0.04040866205280511,0.0,0.079882221733905,0.10555634360940079,0.04211081051095021,0.23308489552103687,0.04252569617612165,0.0793347412270894,0.10357378912088097,0.039821880728785584,0.19633016076634557,0.21323190139803191,0.05353616763006758,0.028586829693769095,0.0,0.0,0.04075448881623438,0.03469606434843373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03202491926389707,0.07173195798877488,0.149928878107557,0.11916517009620957,0.19116709033272364,0.5557051482002867,0.08079833566800923,0.08510606958345673,0.0,0.034055833731374385,0.0,0.0939531890391002,0.0,0.1356269061997292,0.043201586303053686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05188766242476075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12354961915718239,0.10512486358672693,0.0,0.03995492892801963,0.06783228090472582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05593549812794478,

542092,B00003CXZ3,A4YXKE5F62II8,0,0,1358899200,Serves to point out that Nolan (of Batman fame) can be a neo-Hitchcock too!,"""The first time watching it felt more confusing in the long run as the many seeing it were inattentive and willing to talk over silly quibs. The second time, it was more focused and geared toward the plot and ideas, felt more in synchronisation with this rather bold and complex storyline. For starters, the Nolan fandom (popularity rose after The Dark Knight) has not been a part differing myself from the friend who had a copy of this DVD (who says this is his favourite film). First off, the idea that it is a favourite is nothing to be ashamed of. Memento has something elusive and cryptic about its ideas and thoughts and leaves for multiple discussion and dissecting of particular scenes (in addition, the cinematography, performances, Hans Zimmer-esque soundtrack, indie feel/credibility, and Hitchcockian/Fincher-esque vibes that ring true in this film are prevalent!, esp. in the case of films like Se7en, Blackmail, and Vertigo). Guy Pearce, who plays Leonard/Lenny, steps in the jacket of a James Stewart-type figure arguing for interpretations and perspective of the murder of his wife which sounds about as paranoid/schizophrenic as his short-term memory loss character Leonard as in Vertigo where he idolises a dead body. Trippy, enigmatic, and quite disturbing at moments- this is uncompromising, complex, and without clear elaboration, inventive all the way especially considering it has no source material from a book but through a brotherly bond through Jonathan (Chris' brother) Nolan too in the form of a short story. In all respect, this film is surprisingly more superior than Inception and The Dark Knight Rises given its source material, its foundation, and credentials. While difficult on many corners, it feels more closely knit and compact in scope with many discussion-heavy elements than his more commercial features.""",0.0,294,0.10233925196891737,0.06442528055082007,0.08681820398272329,0.0,0.0,0.4145913806430982,0.04183459297946115,0.1576112956226448,0.04667424731871729,0.04429932780262817,0.0,0.06017667952745935,0.0,0.036396232580425306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06015473368388094,0.0,0.14524664825901204,0.11642078085663797,0.10597446408711406,0.0946694530516584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05791777932357123,0.15049901077597394,0.0,0.05161682217049124,0.0,0.0,0.2005724290649355,0.0,0.0,0.3174096801367986,0.0,0.14597375347225908,0.1703751207936486,0.19629891838624464,0.0,0.0474906290741177,0.0,0.19187971011747873,0.0,0.3081021621896295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058116865057381964,0.04093260593398891,0.22632362661265118,0.03906588755860731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054702315772864836,0.11594138671632719,0.06974828780655924,0.3932157231740575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16454064074826336,0.10607342137295495,0.05655333529855926,0.06304927631467948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03786295649646445,0.0,0.06360651357536988,0.0,0.0,0.06010361149064255,0.0,0.0,0.058311038313378465,0.14849372168243896,0.0,0.0743997368823661,0.0,0.0,

All in all, Conan the Destroyer isn't a bad film on it's own when you don't compare it to the original or take it seriously.",0.5,90,0.14663004073087404,0.18461501974108419,0.2487834636515512,0.17068235357610959,0.0,0.1485049720923075,0.0,0.11291146970574599,0.13374822765960862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17628835354520028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1795824546800286,0.0,0.0,0.2774760943365163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909559009498491,0.0,0.16731908436287427,0.24411074363810953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621364332360541,0.11194595570517016,0.11955207525361218,0.0,0.14881415703504192,0.0,0.14510131205253002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4929690401902283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15716746273221893,0.0,0.08102871282284833,0.0,0.18520261196557797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15131623366137206,0.33418848617525976,0.0,0.0,0.1065987511100924,0.0,0.11696303775507343,
24179,0780020227,A3DTHQIPBY0NI7,8,8,1198800000,A caveat . . .,"I've noted that a number of reviewers mention seeing ""Night and Fog""  in a high school class. I think one would have to be very careful about using this film in high school. This is not simply because it is very graphic. If it is the ONLY film about the Holocaust that students see, particularly in the context of a survey course in European history, where there's very little time for an in-depth look at anything, it could accomplish little. Watching the film, students see the horrors perpetrated by the SS, but they do not get any sense of how anti-Semitism pervaded every aspect of society, from top to bottom, not only in Germany and Poland, but in other countries as well. ""Night and Fog""  gives students bad men to hate, but it does not ask them to consider who supported Hitler and made his rise to power possible.For this purpose, the Louis Malle film ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" is very good, since it reveals the anti-Semitism that existed at all level of French society, from the cook's helper to the protagonist's mother. It can begin a great discussion about prejudice in its different manifestations, including name-calling by children and banal dinner table conversation . Films like ""Night and Fog""  shouldn't be employed for their shock value alone; one must reserve plenty of discussion time for the complex issues they raise. If the film is part of a comprehensive examination of the Holocaust, then it has a purpose to serve, but if it is not taught wisely and carefully, then for students it becomes a film about an evil that occurred a long time ago---and that has nothing to do with them.",1.0,282,0.21004076472756686,0.0,0.04454635344203894,0.0,0.09661580442099704,0.2127265173537288,0.0,0.04043511705598743,0.09579408107149834,0.09091980359019246,0.06458160708021123,0.0,0.0,0.1493990307202318,0.10012322558604286,0.05319952353025971,0.1246626975535251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29810377237958174,0.0,0.18125138571148333,0.09714964655668067,0.059394495829522914,0.04865046559752131,0.050237019800086866,0.0,0.10296123499687362,0.04258668247463037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0514567792581433,0.06383656553044122,0.14899903377898288,0.2605802589532875,0.0,0.17975764852441276,0.262258028861583,0.06714721565739626,0.0,0.048734810232688205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21002488505774944,0.23225295619746966,0.0,0.08562641456645607,0.11838476796429588,0.0,0.06103616232029226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11427153363410138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17893896314800167,0.3278578615127408,0.060504014088842914,0.12745952724276907,0.13077452803866574,0.05100388830672894,0.10070943545982539,0.08442567574664747,0.16327857186125216,0.23213978147136827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21230536317333779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05538622856866473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05079467597453052,0.0,0.03817444755959372,0.05706849855143938,0.0,
39857,0782002064,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,8,8,1354665600,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL on Blu ray!,"'It's a Wonderful Life' needs no introduction. Frank Capra's 1946 Masterpiece was seen as ""just another film"" when it was released and not even seen as a Christmas movie. It's box office performance was less than stellar and it soon faded into obscurity. THEN........ Endless TV showings and re-showings and the rest is history.  'It's a Wonderful Life' has become one of the most cherished Christmas/Holiday classics of all time and loved by millions.With that in mind, this review will focus on the video/audio quality of the Blu Ray presentation along with the packaging and any special features.So is 'It's a Wonderful Life' on Blu Ray worth the upgrade from your previous DVD or VHS copies?  For those who do not enjoy long detailed reviews I will cut right to the chase here. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is INCREDIBLE on Blu Ray.  The quality of this scan/transfer easily rivals the newer 4K scan of  'Casablanca' and in many ways is superior to it.  Regular readers of my Blu Ray reviews know I have a rather large collection and when I say this is probably one of THE best Black and White titles in my entire BD collection, you can rest assured I really think so.  Except for the very last reel where there is an unfortunate vertical scratch that runs from top to bottom on the right hand side, this is a perfect transfer visually.  No visible film defects, no DNR visible with enough fine detail and natural film grain to satisfy the most rabid 'grain hounds', while still retaining a beautiful smooth and glossy appearance.This AVC encode is one of the very best in my collection. I could detect NO encoding artifacts. (and I was looking for them) I found myself actually gasping with wonder as this film unfolded. For classic film fans who are constantly looking for ""THE"" best Black and White transfer, you are almost there with this title.  If only Paramount could have either digitally removed the vertical scratch in the last reel (it's not THAT bad, but it IS annoying and once you see it you can't stop seeing it) or even sightly cropped the frame on the right side for the last reel. It is really the ONLY thing that keeps me from calling this a perfect transfer.  (A great big PHOOEY to whoever decided to let this slide--probably a relative of Mr. Potter!)How about the audio? Again, another ""Mr. Potter"" decision here with the audio being presented in 'lossy' Dolby Digital. It is presented in MONO as it should be and is clear and relatively free of defects. You can hear what you need to hear clearly and otherwise there isn't much to say about it. It gets the job done. Still, I can't help but wonder how much better it MIGHT have sounded if given a nice Mono DTS-HD Master Audio track.  Since the picture quality is SO GREAT the Dolby Digital audio encoding really isn't detrimental to getting full enjoyment out of this Blu Ray.The media itself is high quality and not of the thin cheap variety that some releases are given. (a nice thick disc) The box features a nice slip cover but the disc case of the the thin/cheap eco-case variety which I have come to loathe.As for special features, you get a 2nd disc with the Colorized version of this film. Some may find this a sell point but I find it an affront to the filmmaker so the less said the better, at least by me.  You also get a nice 23 minute documentary hosted by the great Tom Bosley (Mr. ""C"", Sheriff Tupper, Father Dowling, etc) which fans will certainly enjoy and finally the films trailer presented in glorious HD.But honestly, with such a SUPER transfer of this film, any bonus features are just gravy as the transfer alone is well worth the price of admission here.If you love this film then the Blu Ray presentation of 'It's A Wonderful Life' will be a real revelation and a true joy to behold.  After countless subpar TV reruns and public domain home releases we FINALLY get to see this movie look as good as it did the day it premiered in theaters.  It is GLORIOUS!Marty G's most highest recommendation!",1.0,712,0.05066216431581815,0.031893179660426416,0.02148930166654351,0.029486241017127112,0.046607769357822064,0.2693773534868132,0.08283941822262096,0.15604822593951762,0.023105683708692492,0.04386000055772699,0.0,0.0,0.091364117711707,0.09008820564890765,0.07244964061689253,0.10265447304418499,0.030068839616450543,0.0,0.02977908225470193,0.05681991507797486,0.19174160240178023,0.0,0.12241073770811332,0.07029794473651878,0.08595627742281425,0.02346913833930826,0.07270349130037164,0.0,0.024834412559566213,0.08217580079728708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06158992186979495,0.07187760473068064,0.1414178328943154,0.030109802552186583,0.23124175381557627,0.32331381585423036,0.0,0.04943080863304322,0.0,0.02919418690998288,0.03166279870078833,0.05771278715035873,0.0,0.09127183211715938,0.03742170152001747,0.0,0.05731724700046067,0.07482931641287158,0.11508101184681593,0.08105333458298941,0.23808406497249507,0.0966961540445182,0.06195967944841734,0.05710918616085197,0.05141679862223358,0.0,0.025066986536334778,0.0,0.0,0.08364067075526713,0.05512494892218009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254862014936921,0.051824437696223115,0.0,0.028697891922301696,0.08632072126822145,0.5109773902859565,0.0,0.030743439356475392,0.06308604557226609,0.07381331067307823,0.0,0.20363606382305638,0.02625536634159605,0.18197556673002524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05120838903899416,0.07497492063315689,0.0,0.0,0.030637203716042737,0.02671849168154244,0.0,0.025316642196061948,0.05228129144063608,0.0577327535158375,0.04900702440172869,0.10818416918745398,0.14732379306946158,0.0,0.18185361428258073,
740605,B00008EY60,A1EMDSTJDUE6B0,1,5,1077667200,Good Overall,"This was a good movie, but not great. It may be good for a backup movie, when the networks are only showing reruns.The title is misleading. When I first saw it, I thought of something like &quot;Frequency&quot;, &quot;Broadcast News&quot; or even &quot;Contact&quot;. A better title might be &quot;We Call Him Radio&quot; or &quot;His Name is Radio&quot;.This is one of those based-on-a-true-story that is probably much closer to the truth than most. Many end up being a glamorized version of reality. This movie seems to be very realistic. Completely believable, which adds to its charm.For the acting and the end goal, I would easily give it five stars. However, because of entertainment expectations from movies, for good and bad, I can only give it four stars. Still, an inspiring movie that makes you want to set your priorities straight.",0.2,138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04295752121699452,0.04729145473353941,0.03817578179489184,0.0,0.0,0.12127486021081649,0.057428818670019983,0.0,0.0,0.033213054895230076,0.0,0.04730736703959944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052369867537981445,0.0,0.053119368563666364,0.09670604465559159,0.043194879224906224,0.0,0.12978643115254102,0.04467297781918183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061068987733119987,0.04575764182654793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10656562932163277,0.10364952338032678,0.05971027118287568,0.0,0.04333714669402326,0.0,0.05836603492161205,0.0,0.0,0.056082375945886734,0.13796356780609553,0.05663491277826742,0.05282824919637092,0.0,0.0,0.03735268162401955,0.10326479558239073,0.035649224549486276,0.03807139569470188,0.10527296671744117,0.09477982955019265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8800080168634985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04991810656901619,0.0529006351568033,0.06364817310826429,0.1121329605559871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07507504137402869,0.0,0.10321447559875178,0.0,0.0,0.04883777721134606,0.047197827506875026,0.0345515006212241,0.0,0.0,0.05647549096620355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637340371605142,0.05321121388650803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05074783058604232,0.03724691589486409,

The last two epiosdes are good but there is just like an abrupt end to the struggle to get home. Janeway travels back in time to try to change things that caused the journey to take 23 years to complete..we have been through seven and then the show ends. It would have made more sense to re-install the tran warp drive thing and encounter the borg along the way and somehow destroy their trans warp network somehow in another fashion or if species 8472 would have come back wanting to destroy the Borg completely it would have made more sense.

641711,B00005JOKM,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,4,31,1296518400,"A total white-wash of communist crimes, and slander against anti-communism","The Communist Parties globally killed over 100 million people in the 20th Century (seeThe Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression), the larger percentage of which occurred before or during the years when the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and its related hearings in the US Senate (under Joseph McCarthy and others) were making extended documentation of those genocidal crimes, as well as trying to root out Communist apologists for such genocide within the US government.  While it may be true that McCarthy ""gave anti-communism a bad name"", in fact history increasingly shows he was correct about the persons being exposed in his hearings.  The black woman, for example, Annie Lee Moss, was employed in high-security code-room work, and had access to secret cables going around the world -- in fact she was a member of the CP USA, and the glorified Edward R. Murrow was in fact a former member of the IWW -- a communist outfit.  One could go down the list of American communist operatives who, in the 1950s were defended with great passion by members of the American left media, but who were later fingered as authentic Soviet spys by the Venona Transcripts (seeVenona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America) or by defecting Soviet spys.The fact is the Western media was slowly infiltrated by various brands of Marxist and socialist radicals, starting during the WW-2 period when we made an unfortunate alliance of convenience with the Soviet monster, to help defeat the Nazi monster, and the situation has only gotten worse.  The fact also is, that nearly ALL of the committees in Congress and the Justice Department, which once investigated foreign conspirators using American social institutions to help destroy America, are today shut down. So they have ascended to many positions of power and influence, without any official efforts to expose them, or root them out.  Conservative historians and websites repeatedly expose them, but nothing is done about it, except for the left-media and Hollywood to make revisionist hit-pieces against anyone who dares to raise a voice against them.  This film makes such a revisionist history, in keeping with communist agendas.  It is both overt and covert CP activists working with a larger number of what we might call, the ""characterological communists"" of the left, to present yet another hit-piece targeting American conservative voices who sought to oppose such Soviet-style (and now Islamofascist-style) atrocity around the world.  None of that history is mentioned in the film, as a background to the motivations of American conservatives such as McCarthy -- the over 100 million massacre victims of Marxist utopianism and plunder.  For a corrective, I recommendThe Soviet StoryDVD, to give you a quick overview of what ""journalists"" like Murrow were deliberately covering up.  One might ask, just how many people would the International Communists have to murder before the American Left would undertake a re-think, and start to study the authentic history of the 20th Century, something other than the usual list of leftist revisionist authors, who are no better than the neo-Nazi revisionist authors.If George Clooney had dared to include the facts about Communist genocides into his film, exposing what we today know about Hiss, the Rosenburgs, and even Annie Moss, it would have made it far more intensive, showing McCarthy as someone who was more than the usual misrepresented cartoon personality, and Murrow being a self-righteous, compromised and even pathetic character (his constant nervous chewing on cigarettes); that would have more than compensated for the slow plodding course of the plot, building towards a greater emotion and substance, to make a really great film.  He didn't, however, because he is one of those ""characterological communists"" whose ignorance of world history is staggering. So instead, we are treated, once more, to yet another a Hollywood film whose goal appears to be little more than rubbing merde into the face of mainstream American conservatism, while ignoring or excusing multiple liberal treasons and apologetics for Marxist mass-murder.",0.12903225806451613,657,0.10895456968429872,0.0,0.023107556176427447,0.03170670603017961,0.02505878658613195,0.2620759103517184,0.06680823811443372,0.1258495926164702,0.0,0.04716288330410104,0.03350045510485314,0.0,0.0,0.03874892363034187,0.10387395964093564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061098745784200624,0.1288629546230042,0.0,0.11282476576673212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05211895778078626,0.061661645965386605,0.026704571057429603,0.08836405960192618,0.08243008239543717,0.0,0.0,0.08007661629897596,0.0331139792626165,0.025763452203864366,0.20275642696766707,0.06475444988694241,0.10878675612874034,0.0755784788250994,0.034831314754255535,0.02657660088397848,0.02528023683610025,0.0,0.06809433931680331,0.0,0.13667425521135318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03093680040601969,0.0,0.3463705494646117,0.020795573967923964,0.06662556074387462,0.03070490023080871,0.110577493955989,0.03166132445486973,0.0539093180923524,0.07004146581780864,0.0,0.029979747257530456,0.0,0.0,0.0352747169879484,0.0,0.04975900269672134,0.0,0.0,0.1542949510481449,0.07425689105572494,0.5887035060251092,0.0,0.13223431138153166,0.0,0.0,0.026120532406902364,0.01459806018006885,0.0,0.27094051274598213,0.0,0.0,0.028488967747888182,0.0,0.12093137440462907,0.0,0.0,0.13177736846782906,0.028730530989840124,0.12797754528094793,0.08166934516836415,0.05621834053460852,0.06208032563310533,0.15809251323865536,0.0,0.07920901472980546,0.11841270355811147,0.021727569234878376,

This is how the story goes: In the near-future, where the sport of boxing has gone hi-tech, Charlie Kenton is a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback.The cast led by Hugh Jackman (as Charlie) is great. The directing by Shawn Levy (who also produced) is great. The story by Dan Gilroy & Jeremy Leven & the screenplay by John Gatins is great.The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore is great. The film editing by Dean Zimmerman is great. The casting by Richard Hicks & David Rubin is great. The production design by Tom Meyer is great. The art direction by Seth Reed, Jason Baldwin Stewart & Jeff Wisniewski is great. The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo is great. The costume design by Marlene Stewart is great.This is a great boxing drama with great family values instilled in it. This is fun, entertaining and fast-paced. Hugh Jackman is great, as usual. This is another great film from Shawn Levy.

My college-age daughter brought it over and she, my younger daughter (age 13), and I watched it.Huh!  It really was quite good!  And that, to me, was a really pleasant surprise.Enter Matt Damon (think the ""Bourne"" movies) - in this movie he plays a grieving widower and father of two children.  He struggles as he mourns the loss of his wife to illness and as he tries to provide for and connect with his children who are also dealing with the loss of their mother in their own ways.  I also have to say that I really liked the character who played the brother...not quite comic relief, but a flavor of it.And so this grieving family buys a zoo!?  That's where the concept of this movie initially lost me.  But the collection of characters, their development and their interactions were all quite good - even for Scarlett Johansson who plays the head zookeeper.I don't know that I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is seriously grieving themselves - it's not a self-help movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a good story.  And I felt even more so when I learned in the titles at the end of the film that the movie was based on a true story.All in all, engaging, enjoyable, and good family entertainment for the, um, >12 year old crowd.4 solid stars",0.0,258,0.0,0.0,0.13499037405619713,0.12348342029839446,0.0,0.26859692143128644,0.043364694620266646,0.08168796702212586,0.04838135947923939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509097040292201,0.05056781917124717,0.0,0.0,0.06496118451865326,0.0,0.11897612603141267,0.050186349762915514,0.0,0.10985048366408916,0.0,0.0,0.19656961169859732,0.0,0.060036124044130966,0.0,0.08603460968723041,0.21401883668770358,0.0,0.0,0.10395418619127261,0.0,0.0,0.13160757993181824,0.0,0.06052509935981824,0.2060410293069517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12084572509836111,0.05322850151690118,0.0,0.235073692221058,0.06433281997131558,0.0,0.15668629860084574,0.0,0.08485943473673097,0.2346014208439249,0.08098944741163826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1751365339331167,0.0577135046879257,0.0,0.06868961253155241,0.0,0.09689451559205972,0.0,0.1134061096125063,0.0,0.2168980013145715,0.3566479012533756,0.24446324222344673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421322668334657,0.0,0.23448710173263473,0.0,0.06699418977577,0.0,0.0,0.1962389769987396,0.062294342830406205,0.06593292394191444,0.0,0.0,0.062301903095996966,0.0,0.10947262964032983,0.0,0.20523317937533256,0.0,0.07712090975322672,0.0,0.0,

787663,B0000W5H88,AG0TA24LI0XV7,3,4,1181174400,Reptile is Hammer-Studio Fun (Lost Continent is a Stinkbomb),"I bought this double feature for ""The Reptile"", a film that I remember seeing on television when I was a child, thirty years ago. It is still enjoyable, rather akin to Corman's Poe films (that same period look/feel), and the Hammer vampire movies. The new couple in town will come to regret moving near Dr. Franklyn's house. It's good, cheesy monster movie fun. I prefer these kind of films where they don't show the monster for a while and then, bang, there it is.Now, about the second movie, ""The Lost Continent"". Where to begin. So much fodder here. It tries to be Mysterious Island, Lifeboat, and The Lost World. It resembles a macabre Love Boat with an HR Pufnstuf budget.A group of selfish dimwits are traveling on a tramp steamer that's loaded with dangerous explosives (the liquid ignites if it gets wet; I won't even comment on that concept), a hazard which the captain hasn't mentioned.  After an hour of nothing, the ship encounters a strange amber-colored world where other, older, empty ships sit still on the sea, and there are some lively killer weeds (vines), floppy monsters that resemble Sid and Marty Krofft productions, and a weird glowing ship/house thing with a young evil overlord called El Supremo (or was it El Diablo, or El Terrifico? El Queso?). He rules the pirates, balloon people, conquistadors, and inquisitors on his ship. Oh, and the organist, too. Confused? Yes, what weeds were the writers smoking? Certainly not anything supremo.You'll marvel at the balloon people, the lady with the D cups, the green eyed crab monster, and the hungry creature who gets fed naughty disobeyers of El Hombre Supremo.Mystery Science Theater 3000 wouldn't have touched this film; it is too dull and slow. I nearly gave up after nothing happened for sixty minutes. But then I wanted to see if the wicked teenage Supremo Boy with the British accent got his comeuppance.It wasn't worth waiting. Awful. Was there even a continent?? Did they explain the balloon things? I must have missed that part when I was laughing, or sleeping.But I like ""The Reptile"". That was cool, something from the Chiller Theater television of my childhood. And if you can keep a straight face when the creepy swarthy mesmo guy speaks in tongues, you're better than I am.

600196,B00005JLF5,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,3,3,1054857600,The Best Spin Off Yet,"With the success of Star Trek: The next generation, a spin-off was inevitable.  With a galaxy of characters and adventures, you couldn't just stop with one Flagship of a massive starfleet.  Deep Space Nine was a completely different approach to Gene Roddenberry's world.  With the perfection of Earth, the chaos of the galaxy beyond it had to be brought to life to show what the Federation was up against.  DS9 was cast with dynamicly different characters who didn't always like each other.  It stuck it's perverbial toungue out at the Kum-Bye-Ya sainthood of the crew of the Star Ship Enterprise.  As time went on, the stories became increasingly deeper and more involving.  You really cared for some (Sisco, Kira, Odo) and loved to hate others (Quark, Garrick, corrupt political preists).  Unfortunately, the spirit of adventuring through the souls and lives of Characters didn't amount to ratings.  The show lagged behind for most of it's entire run.  Attempts to boast it with the addition of Worf, introduction of a vicious new enemy and an all out war helped considerably, making the last few seasons highly excitable.

855681,B0006210ZG,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,2,3,1091750400,Really creepy but very well done summer flick!,"This summer thriller entitled &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a really scary but also really well executed update of the 1960s original version of the novel. Featuring a stellar cast of Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, and Jon Voight.Denzel Washington is the center actor in this movie playing a horribly scarred Gulf War veteran who returned home from the war in Iraq in 1991 after liberating Kuwait from the Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. More than a decade later, he has been having recurring nightmares about the memories of what really happened during his time in Kuwait and he beleives that he was the subject of a medical experiment where a medical device is implanted in the brain to brainwash the subject and use them for sinister purposes. The devices are the products of a corporation called Manchuria Inc.However noone believes him except a friend who was also a veteran of the Gulf War. Now he must convince his friend not to run for president of the United States but his mother is a power-hungry individual who 'cares' deeply for her son but isn't exactly what she is thought to be.This movie is really chilling and really delivers the scares through it's suspenseful tone and the frightening portray of what it's like if criminal corporations actually brainwash their victims to cover-up lies, crimes, and other horrific deeds. The acting is superb by most and the directing is excellent. One of the scenes was very hard to stomach however but overall, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a thriller worth seeing on the big screen.",0.6666666666666666,260,0.050969731622482056,0.06417360291778866,0.0,0.11866100167612001,0.0,0.1806751527208959,0.04167116596370143,0.0,0.0,0.04412627228977785,0.0,0.05994159907243185,0.0,0.14501620217096378,0.048592985689392285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10556047439152898,0.0942996264298616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04997036191633322,0.0,0.20566072333883229,0.062084059924037295,0.06666047958715549,0.14984166901201404,0.0,0.04820931323227823,0.15808485893432359,0.0,0.26172631148800846,0.056569849886061584,0.0,0.0,0.04730510672925001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051149759963334054,0.0612172923723189,0.07529777336166364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040772702534466305,0.3099793020510601,0.03891327650237348,0.041557222245961985,0.0,0.0,0.05924558152826502,0.0,0.0,0.3842327087589695,0.2804948294052831,0.0,0.0,0.06600706562907338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05774423059750765,0.03473790791149917,0.5140795068618829,0.05872904460600553,0.061860162285342656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194893101698074,0.0528295225501555,0.1408310236330087,0.0,0.0,0.053309376358196534,0.05151927244691843,0.11314513408665414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053761396448691975,0.0,0.15282202911091844,0.0,0.0,0.14791363032585447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

I guess there was supposed to be some doubt as to whether Johnny Depp was an alien or not, the screenwriter seemed to think there was, but I didn't.

Same cast, same cheap production values, same excuses for sex scenes.  The release date for this one was last August so the movie's simulated sex scenes appear a bit more graphic than others (but these aren't the kind of movies you watch from beginning to end, normally, so I don't know if that's true).But don't get excited: by ""more graphic,"" I mean they're a little closer to a porn movie but still safe enough for HBO.When I saw the title on my guide, I remembered the final 1960's Beach Party movie, THE GHOST IN THE INVISIBLE BIKINI, an awesomely-horrible Sixties flick that starred Deborah Walley, Nancy Sinatra and Boris Karloff.  Was GHOST IN A TEENY BIKINI a parody?While TEENY BIKINI is a parody of INVISIBLE BIKINI (if you're wondering why characters sing those incredibly lame songs, that's why), this movie is still a lame latenight HBO skin flick.  The acting is bad (these are real porn stars, aren't they?), the jokes are horrible, and the movie ends abruplty--like they just ran out of money.  All two hundred dollars of it.  Where's the heroine in peril scene?  Where's the slapstick fights and chase for the finale?  Where the heck is Tommy Kirk?This is what happens when someone sets out to make a parody of an awful movie...and ends up making something worse.

319535,6302544289,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,1,2,1153612800,"Unless you are a fan of Stephen King's work, you can ignore this one","I love watching movie adaptations of Stephen King's work. When I came across ""Sleepwalkers"", I thought it would be interesting. However, I was a little skeptic because I hadn't ever heard of it, but then realized that King directly made this into a movie without making it a book first. After watching the entire movie, I can clearly say that unless you are a die-hard King fan, you can avoid this movie at all costs.The story is about the Brady family consisting of Charles (acted by Brian Krause, who nowadays is famous for his role as 'Leo' in the hit TV show ""Charmed"") and his mother Mary (played by Alice Krige), who move to Travis, Indiana. However, we know from the beginning that they are not who they say they are; in fact, they aren't even human beings. They are the Sleepwalkers - shape shifting creatures who feast on female virgins to keep themselves alive. Their only flaw is that they are vulnerable to cats. Anyway, Charles has his eyes on his next victim, who happens to be a high school cheerleader called Tanya (played by M&auml;dchen Amick) and enrolls in the same class as her to seduce her. Will the Sleepwalkers be stopped in time or is it the end for Tanya?I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but there are SO many holes in the storyline, which makes me confused to enjoy it, such as:1) In the first scene of the movie, we see a bunch of dead cats hanging around the house, which proves that the Sleepwalkers can fight it and kill it. If that's the case, why were Charles and his mother afraid to even go outside their house to fight the cats off, instead of putting lame traps around them? We know they are not like vampires, and can walk during daylight.2) When Tanya comes over to see Charles in his home, Charles realizes that the mirror reflects their true appearance, and pushes them to another room. So he knows he should avoid mirrors and other things, but yet in the graveyard, he lets Tanya take pictures of him? What's that all about? Okay, once or twice is fine, but he doesn't even stop her!3) Thirdly, as Michael R Gates mentioned in his review, what is the point of the incest scenes between Charles and his mother? It doesn't progress the story in any way at all. It's not like they are mating to reproduce another of their kind (which would have made more sense).There are many more questions, but I don't want to bore you with the details. The point is this movie was too confusing and silly to even enjoy it. The plus point is, the cast acted well, and we get to see King himself make an appearance, along with other horror creators Clive Barker and Tobe Hooper. Unfortunately, even with the cast, the story doesn't get any better. In fact, I felt sorry for the Sleepwalkers, because they are alone and they just need to keep themselves alive.All in all, you can watch this movie if you have a lot of free time on your hands, but don't rent it in hopes of getting scared, or seeing something interesting, unless you are a fan of one of the cast members.",0.5,549,0.05765805772776649,0.036297280600164544,0.12228370153069973,0.0,0.02652189747997675,0.1751859621209745,0.25926626037251005,0.08879839364390324,0.0525926542265525,0.07487488379886602,0.07091290176956855,0.0,0.0,0.1230340874388694,0.08245414733970324,0.14603742291530547,0.0,0.07061564933913919,0.0,0.16166531710084114,0.0,0.06559160805066705,0.05970614061024956,0.026668441893470406,0.06521726910853815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028263774600477486,0.04676169218372745,0.11632391893323413,0.10534623777071221,0.0377038848140755,0.226005495860705,0.0,0.05453541301631274,0.23247769454196596,0.03426763852612539,0.13158686142437012,0.17598083819599816,0.0,0.028128332614525787,0.05351255515361945,0.03322558633061459,0.07207017307559817,0.03284114741330456,0.057861709662729785,0.0,0.17035692459263777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918443834062793,0.20720538088429422,0.06602930420259677,0.0235052122405762,0.03249767155545761,0.08777534822605454,0.06701987731018494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031730178973624866,0.09410565646332407,0.0,0.0,0.038079022607227044,0.05266428857966654,0.0,0.09245805162712051,0.0,0.15718507717781233,0.4015380086765951,0.13287111924662487,0.06997754735133922,0.03589877087314371,0.05600408359099766,0.2764563560318862,0.07725199585613293,0.05976189326419049,0.25489773736727533,0.03552203815745896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042664070518711905,0.033858337880684326,0.03583598630078434,0.13947147219886058,0.030408024540164072,0.033862447050397156,0.05762518980098081,0.05950076868360689,0.0985575274947267,0.13943590252117827,0.03078080632992764,0.06287535195288985,0.0626632413604804,0.13797707923865396,

192820,1582704414,AV4GSTTTCIT05,29,38,1133136000,Really disappointing,"I expected to like this movie since a number of friends had recommended it. However, as soon as I saw JZ Knight I had my doubts. She seemed to me be a huckster. I wondered why, with all of the really solid spiritual teachers available, the filmmakers would choose her. The other talking heads were a bit uneven, but one or two seemed like they might be solid. Anyway, I saw the movie twice and then, because I still had doubts, I looked into the film a little more and found a few unsettling items:*Followers of JZ Knight made the film. They were apparently unconcerned that in the 1980s she had her students use copper to shield against aliens, that she had predicted a number of apocalyptic disasters which never occurred, that it can cost thousands to hear her talk (yes, I know that initial lectures are less expensive).*One of her former students says he quit working with her after finding her practicing her Ramtha voices. It didn't seem to me she had practiced them very well!*The psychiatrist studying physics, Jeffrey Satinover, has a book calling for attempting to cure homosexuals. He believes that they are ill. He lists Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as one of his heroes!*The Irish theologian in the film had to resign as president of his college as a result of a scandal.*Many of the ""scientists"" are lecturers at Knight's center.==> One of the few real scientists in the film, David Albert, has charged the filmmakers with carefully selecting bits of his hours of interview to present a point of view that is 180 degrees opposite of what he said. THINK ABOUT THIS. The filmmakers have, I believe, discredited themselves entirely through their misrepresentation of Dr. Albert's views. Why would they do this if they were really interested in the truth? &lt;==I really believe that intentions matter and that they shape our life. If you agree, please ask yourself, what could possibly be the intentions of filmmakers who distort the material provided in interviews? More importantly, what is the intention of JZ Knight in making up a story about channeling a 35,000 year old teacher from Atlantis? DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS AN ENLIGHTENED CIVILIZATION CALLED ATLANTIS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO PHYSICAL RECORD OF IT HAVING EVER EXISTED??? Their intentions are clear and they have something to do with your wallet!",0.7631578947368421,399,0.07565925758161403,0.04762951460152059,0.03209228488350196,0.0,0.03480219681462468,0.0766266985924428,0.12371301080122667,0.14565224710782776,0.03450620199361368,0.09825128252635763,0.04652617268323057,0.0,0.0,0.02690768090272042,0.0,0.038326240710613725,0.13471509433782464,0.0,0.0,0.042427644463145064,0.14317417624317932,0.0,0.02611558817424127,0.03499449329432944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2997296999991408,0.07417579734727711,0.06136097977121077,0.1526409610782648,0.32255062096533077,0.0,0.11121217506311497,0.0,0.07156170400679132,0.14079630417268418,0.04496620580254488,0.06475090799452231,0.08397204983506149,0.0,0.0,0.07021950363527892,0.0,0.04728546194205466,0.08618871080086307,0.07592649090184017,0.0,0.05588585076617558,0.0,0.0,0.03725022148576639,0.042965712359787946,0.0,0.37647162525438294,0.0,0.12337473564003464,0.0,0.03839311706790753,0.04397194737672856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16654614315390626,0.0,0.0,0.19596122724859547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040441341125172496,0.0,0.23204162695913616,0.3452107653805253,0.08717714949489651,0.04591248377618268,0.0471065876894174,0.07348890255789879,0.25393741018634175,0.06082232614323638,0.0,0.18814408704967742,0.0,0.04778110970182995,0.03956610824708504,0.03823749684763336,0.027992027724000914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039901596618028064,0.13330353317621246,0.11342419212923496,0.0,0.04310926436068944,0.036593729586885664,0.0,0.11000723082277178,0.08222709029458478,0.06035145702019745,
1090975,B000TJBN7Q,A1HJZ1SBR0ROHH,12,14,1180224000,Should be remembered as one of the best horror films of '07!,"28 Days Later was one of those pre-hyped horror films that generated a lot of buzz before its release. I saw the film in the theaters during that hype, liked the film, but I think the hype machine left me with expectations that were extremely high. I appreciated the film much more after I bought it on DVD. The first film is a clever and creepy ""zombie"" film that also touches on the possibility of how we would survive if an entire city was wiped out by some kind of infection.28 Weeks Later was a differenct story for me. I went in with low expectations thinking I would experience a quick cash in sequel but to my surprise this film was made with a great deal of integrity and respect for the original. It follows that whole theory that the second time around everything is a bit bigger and louder, but it offers us this without compromising the story. 28 Weeks Later is a welcomed chapter in the frightening look of what would happen if we lost control during an outbreak of a violent infection. Needless to say, from a horror film standpoint, this is the best one to come out in awhile.28 Weeks Later is a direct sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, although none of the characters from the first film have returned. Instead, we follow a new group of individuals from their first harrowing encounters with the infected during the initial terrorizing of Britain to their attempts to repopulate London six months later. Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) have two children, Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton). The kids are in Spain during the outbreak, while Don and Alice are in hiding. When their hideout is discovered by a group of infected, the cowardly Don runs off, assuming that Alice has been killed. 28 weeks later, the kids come home, but it isn't long before it becomes apparent the crisis isn't over. Members of the U.S. military, including the lead medic (Rose Byrne), a sharpshooter (Jeremy Renner), and a helicopter pilot (Harold Perrineau), try to contain the new epidemic but it spreads too fast and too violently, triggering the ultimate solution: Code Red.This film had me hooked from the start. The opening scene did what no horror film has done in recent memory: it made me jump out of my seat. That first initial break in during the first 10 minutes was exceptionally well done and it really threw me head first into the story. Intense is probably the best way to describe this scene and the film is filled with many intense moments that should entertain the viewer.Despite all the entertainment provided by the action, the films smaller moments probably are the highlights. The first film did a great job of creating the isolation and decaying nature of London after the infection outbreak. This atmosphere is wonderfully re-created here with several overhead helicopter shots of an empty London, looking incredibly creepy. Both films tapped into my fear of just being alone in a potential situation like this. The idea of this is no different from being one of few survivors if we had a nuclear fall out. I also dug the idea of repopulating Britain but under strict guidelines to ensure that the infected could not break out again. It made me think of what could happen we had to be in a similar situation. The idea of being under such a lockdown is even more terrifying than the infected that are represented in this film.The acting is top notch from all involved. If I have one complaint is that I cared more about the characters in the first film but since the cast has been expanded a bit this time around, I can see why character development couldn't be properly explored. Actors like Robert Carlyle and Harold Parrineau for instance are criminally underused and we aren't given much insight into their personalities. They do a decent job, especially Carlyle but they aren't given enough to do. The children played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton are truly the only characters who garner our sympathy and they do a damn good job of it too. Not merely because they're children but because they do a great job of making their characters believeable and easy to relate to given the situaton. Jason Renner and Rose Byrne also provide adequate support with Byrne creating a female character that is strong and believable.I want to talk a bit about the shakey cam because in most reviews I read, even those that liked it, many people have complained about the shakey cam. I'm not a fan of this device. I think quick edits take away from the action taking place on screen and it also makes it extremely hard to tell what's going on. The action scenes in Batman Begins are an example of this. I love that film but my only complaint was that the hand to hand combat scenes were so hard to get into because the quick edits made it difficult to tell what was going on. To my surprise, the shakey cam in this film, added to the visceral experience of the film. There are many moments where it is hard to tell what is going on when the infected strike but the screams of horror and the snarls of the infected was all I needed to hear in order to truly feel the horror of the experience. The quick edits actually made many of the scenes much more intense.  The best example of this is during the code red scene when everyone is looked  down and one of the infected breaks in and begain to infect everyone. The scene is mostly dark but  the intensity of how quick it was taking place, made the scene all the more frightening. The slower action scenes work as well (especially the various sniper scenes towards the end and a very frightening night vision scene that had my theater shrieking a bit) but I did appreciate the quick cuts this time around. You win this round shakey cam!I think when the summer movie season is over 28 Weeks Later will be remembered as one of the pleasant surprises of the season. I'm not sure how well it will do financially compared to the original film since the horror genre has been milked to death between 2006 and 2007. If the film doesn't register in theaters, I think it will definitely find a great home on DVD. This is a welcomed companion piece to 28 Days Later and it's a truly frightening experience that did not disappoint in the slightest. Definitely recommended.28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)",0.8571428571428571,1120,0.044247897407855355,0.03714030409564714,0.050049522010427984,0.06867474298102035,0.05427576508833275,0.18672369638989855,0.0964683113020629,0.022715195798473926,0.0,0.038306946242737554,0.07255989133286728,0.052036564482318616,0.053197754996090134,0.1363825872965016,0.05624612561434315,0.014942921912432435,0.0875395507008601,0.05419180129341407,0.03467839150579481,0.03308401587978603,0.2651536481298935,0.1342300155187509,0.03054642361598962,0.09550740685147469,0.01668299364944561,0.013665162019989479,0.05644320205680274,0.06677763505974019,0.057840431359907615,0.04784775716015515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05379210661557983,0.06975253345144494,0.18298239359444643,0.07012704502685202,0.1767189843791035,0.15551334702212044,0.01886061253227233,0.014390813991203812,0.02737770624242724,0.016998634052899392,0.07374404087565455,0.10081170117531431,0.07400697300303012,0.017714673567048735,0.010894597128822363,0.0,0.05006038923183599,0.08714037284566854,0.03350358776651661,0.05899273619058721,0.29356315642326336,0.0788233479079662,0.07215339959466029,0.033252447125878805,0.0,0.0,0.07297763288526551,0.018963179502443108,0.0,0.016233564561919198,0.016048551665477084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013471861118025915,0.0150876723183228,0.04730271933246058,0.016709660878072047,0.1809402564819734,0.6092120501722454,0.08497320069079554,0.0,0.0,0.014326201996233474,0.070719300195675,0.1343785641818868,0.045862421078045855,0.22006507935102412,0.054520584357188456,0.01862925708145665,0.0,0.014908321790162788,0.09822367365685794,0.0,0.018334147996372795,0.10703307805330042,0.04667140043396839,0.03464892025186038,0.08844534786311689,0.06088270543396854,0.0,0.01426743749355178,0.04724356019928188,0.07505827604379858,0.04808897115566474,0.011765139142704766,

536146,B00003CXSP,A14B2NR2XELLQ0,9,10,1051920000,Probably the best that could have been done given the source,"Hannibal is not a great movie.  It is not even a particularly good movie.  However, given that the movie was based upon Thomas Harris's wreck of a novel, the fact that the movie is fairly entertaining and not a total disaster is great credit to the talents in front and behind the camera.Thomas Harris's two superb novels - Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs - gave birth to fantastic adaptations.  'Hannibal' on the other hand, was a ridiculously weak novel.The worst thing about Hannibal is the way it treats one of today's best known literature and movie characters - Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector.  In previous books, Lecter had a mystique about him, an aura of terrible, invincible evil, but all that was reduced.Firstly, the uncaged Lecter is no where near as menacing as the man behind bars.  When imprisoned, Lecter is a caged demon, a shadow that threatens mankind and must never be unleashed upon us.  But out of chains, he's an elitist, a sort of evil James Bond, a man who likes nice cars, good food and expensive wine.  Indeed, in the book, Claris locates Lecter by simply tracing the most expensive wine bottles in the US.  What a disappointment.Second, Harris made Lecter the hero of the book, by pitching him against pedophile Mason Verger.  When facing a child rapist, Lecter, who 'merely' eats adults, is seen as a hero in comparison.  A 'good' Lecter is much less interesting than the heart of evil that he was in the previous installations.Worst of all, Harris gives Lecter a motive.  It turns out (spoiler) that Lecter kills people because the Nazis during World War 2 murdered his sister.  What a cope out - the greatness of Hannibal was in his evil being inexplicable, as he actually told Claris in 'Silence', you could not reduce him to influences.  Harris completely sold out the integrity of the character by giving him the motive.In Hannibal the movie, the production team wisely alleviated (although they did not entirely solve) all of these problems.  The scene in which Claris traces Hannibal by his wine consumption is gone and less time is spent on his fancy food intakes.  By downplaying Verger's pedophilia, Hannibal does not look that good in comparison.  Finally, the silliness of the motive is ignored completely.Furthermore, the improved script features much more contact between Claris and Lecter.  The interaction between them is the heart of the story, and yet in the book, the only contact among them in some 400 pages is a single letter from Lecter.  Here the producers introduce several more communications between them, including a phone call in a very climatic scene.From a technical point of view, the movie is well executed, with unnecessary scenes and minor characters from the book discarded, and great attention spent on the fantastic scenes in Florence, where Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi tries to outmaneuver Lecter, but end up outmaneuvered himself.  Those scene are not bad in the book, but Scott's wonderful sense of scene, and the amazing photography really brings the menace alive, and help preserve the aura of danger around Lecter.But the movie again cannot completely disregard the novel, and the main plot of the novel is a fairly pedestrian cat and mouse story, where two parties hunt for Lecter, to results neither of them expected (but the audience surely does).  Try as hard as the producers do to escape the confines of the story, they just can't.  Most of the movie remains an effective, extremely well directed and acted, thriller.  That is all.Then we come to the controversial ending.  After a lukewarm book, Harris finally comes up with an interesting premise and some powerful scenes. (Spoiler)  After Capturing Clarice, Lecter begins in an effort to turn her into his dead sister, using drugs, brain washing, and his own mental powers.  This is an extremely cool notion, which leads to the book's best scene - the infamous brain dinner.In the novel, Hannibal captures Paul Krendler, an FBI executive who does all that is in his power to harass Clarice Starling.  In a gross but brilliant scene, Harris depicts Lecter opening Krendler's skull, and piece by piece taking out parts of his brain.  We read the breathtaking description of dinner conversation, where the three of them eat Krendler's brain.  With each additional piece which Lecter takes out and cooks, Krendler's speech retard more and more, and from a highly aggressive yet sophisticated person he becomes an agree, bitter, childish, and finally speechless person.  It is a terrible scene, but it is truly both shocking and amazing.The movie, lacking the proper foundations for this scene, completely misses the point.  The special effects are so over the top as to make the scene unbelievable and not the least bit scary.  Furthermore, because the producers (wisely, in my opinion), deleted so much of the back-story, at this point they have no idea what to do next.  So you've got a little chase, some bantering between Starling and Lecter, as Scott rushes towards the ending credits.Ultimately, the only way to have made a good movie out of 'Hannibal' would have been to completely rewrite the story.  Having to work with what Harris gave them, Ridley Scott and the rest of the production team salvaged as much as possible.",0.9,880,0.03722592467081064,0.04686941900667951,0.07895035041143166,0.0,0.13698722386773984,0.25448799862809546,0.030434684188632516,0.14332785576494747,0.016977767389594257,0.016113889910481714,0.045783684770069895,0.0218892799774332,0.04475547395816194,0.10591309873960959,0.10647017949012745,0.018857305704720162,0.04418841451474212,0.0,0.0,0.02087528145569309,0.0,0.0,0.02569882256799907,0.06887206736664915,0.0,0.08622414653089958,0.053421616052189466,0.021067604547810582,0.0,0.045286312945105794,0.07510252017276543,0.022671656926783728,0.09737143644433101,0.14591652746651956,0.0,0.0,0.24246146118900033,0.02212430631019674,0.2230115322687891,0.051644988688951766,0.0,0.018160569958283343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07471481801898473,0.04471026709110148,0.151233490190929,0.0,0.084231992375075,0.01832788191853904,0.04228004405165783,0.11911395291741586,0.27784777719963333,0.04263067472576697,0.015175732494674875,0.04196311568496094,0.0,0.021635110533687413,0.12893235723135676,0.02393069274581005,0.0,0.020486039572135524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05100267638475418,0.05711992292000344,0.09948989498662958,0.02108685203914814,0.1141692953615799,0.652584882163064,0.0,0.13553936825179705,0.023177418611775105,0.0,0.053546775021457826,0.02992584653463226,0.019292114792885506,0.15428465807625844,0.0,0.047018594876624915,0.03893469252019341,0.018813641882685694,0.0688632923943814,0.0,0.0462737656837431,0.045023668177618346,0.03926482700006684,0.0,0.07440940812820453,0.03841563903052897,0.06363195776699235,0.05401462284596051,0.0,0.05412584023092683,0.020228717324540645,0.029694169155493964,

The girls who operate the spaceship are all pretty (apparently a requirement for women to be in space). You get to see their personalities and some of the lines were good and at times an attempt at wit. A sudden asteroid belt jumps into the picture in what appears to be deep space. They actually have to fly through an asteroid in order to save the ship, but in doing so the ship gets damaged and two fuel cell banks must be jettison because of over heating and a danger of explosion. They hyper-drive out and end up near a remote penal colony, very low on fuel. As it turns out the colony is occupied by just two men, who are fighting at the moment. Everyone else in the colony has been killed by prisoner 762. The girls eventually meet both men (one at a time) and can't determine which one is the good guy and which one is the psycho killer. Who is the killer? Who will live and who will die? Warning: One lame love making scene.

1235776,B001TE6PGO,ASOT5NHUUHBBM,2,2,1304121600,Better than I Remember,"Another Woman - B+This was a good movie but I didn't love it. Basicly this is a romance posing as a suspence story, but the suspense never really gets off the ground and the romance is nice but tempid. The heroine and hero are married but on the brink of divore, when the wife losses her memory everything changes and the husband finds himself falling back in love with her. Their romance is sweet but almost entirly based on what was and so the viewer only gets to see glimpses of their falling in love before all of sudden they both love each other again.A Change of Place - BFunny how a secon viewing can change things, when I first saw this movie I loved it and actually bought hte book and these movies because of it. After watching it again I couldn't remember what I liked about it. The acting which isn't really up to par with the rest of the HQ movies which is saying something. At the end of the movie in the scene that should be the big climax of the story the Rick Springfield appears to be unable to keep himself from laughing, which made what should have been an impassioned moment seem funny. The story is your typical twins switching place story, with a romance between two people that start off hating each other. I enjoyed the romance, but I didn't like how the end was resolved within about one minute.Trecherous Beauties - AI really enjoyed this movie. It has all the drama and passion you'd hope from a HQ story. Storyline aside this was just fun and indulgent and wonderful. Like the above the romance starts off as a hate, and yada yada yada the best movie in the set.I have yet to watch the entire fourth movie and don't even remember it's name. What I can say is that the parts that I did see seemed very contrived. I think the difference between a good HQ movie and a bad one is that when it's good you know it's contrived but you love it, when it's bad the contrivancies just annoy you. Maybe when I see the hwole thing I'll change mind.",1.0,370,0.07804993765873358,0.04913451128375608,0.06621267283205111,0.0,0.03590187610337487,0.23714384356798532,0.03190552316150546,0.060101825843889796,0.03559652844248491,0.06757055004406456,0.047996305984214116,0.04589427805329578,0.046918404085482,0.19430536577934207,0.0,0.07907454537021387,0.0,0.04779511525235266,0.0,0.04376827253139882,0.0,0.0443946702424671,0.0,0.07220049752867574,0.0,0.10846939579219331,0.0,0.0,0.03825980153517077,0.06329986308226268,0.0,0.09506930588849397,0.0,0.0,0.09488519938424461,0.0,0.09683012244209108,0.0,0.1558594478147461,0.2382198428393263,0.0,0.0761529157771338,0.07243829844944955,0.224882266588257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20178105861798018,0.09466559354855889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17260771998979457,0.05958789086045832,0.06363656433570053,0.04399109749643869,0.0,0.09072274461019271,0.0,0.05017441724974374,0.0,0.12885649925036838,0.12738792997460832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03564501305170616,0.0,0.20859603005292637,0.0,0.13298537487744122,0.5622927314613797,0.08993177174654504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0374230458048508,0.10457364847515972,0.0,0.10782725614866301,0.0,0.049290896483752955,0.040816317537249264,0.0394457246948859,0.11550607757117279,0.045832989610802094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15601089071626167,0.2013608968727805,0.13341429073247976,0.0,0.0,0.08511242822927612,0.0,0.12451688289325302,

976967,B000EQ5UHI,A35SK8CQEKTT84,1,1,1150329600,This Movie Rules,"I've been watching CGI movies a lot these days. I must say, they do SUCK. Over The Hedge? Lame. Robots? Nice to look at, but boring! Madagascar? A waste of Jada Pinkett Smith's voice talent. Now, I look at these movies, then look at Hoodwinked, my saviour. At first, I was highly sceptical about this film beacause of the poor CGI. I'll admit, the previews were a turnoff. But I said, hey! 'If the graphics are so bad, the movie has to have a catch to it."" And it did. It was hilarious. I haven't laughed at such clever jokes in a long time. The voice acting was terrific. The Wolf had a great dead-pan voice that totally suited him, Anne Hathaway and Glenn Close did good jobs as Red and Granny. I love EVERY character. Each were delightful, even the squirrel who, surprisingly, didn't annoy me. Trust me, kids AND adults will love this show. My neighbour's kid had such a great time when he ""figured out"" that the criminal was the Bunny. I mean, people our age would know it instantly, but let the kids work it out themselves. It's a great morale boost for sure. In the end, Hoodwinked is a great example that a movie doesn't have to be flashy to be wonderful. It's like an indie flick. Low budget, great storyline.",1.0,226,0.0707914436434508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06512614141932817,0.1433932816255606,0.05787674180287554,0.054512471690874316,0.32286119793674056,0.1225732378241334,0.0,0.08325239701208663,0.0,0.15105886341637462,0.0,0.0,0.08403180534738054,0.0,0.0,0.07939581481346668,0.06698127203920351,0.08053210267202629,0.04887069335720362,0.0,0.0,0.06558796713660144,0.33863437515146483,0.16025457024773626,0.06940342722704491,0.11482619523975311,0.0714101244133807,0.0,0.0925841952414369,0.0,0.0,0.06695752110389666,0.0878251073795791,0.0,0.040389948308369394,0.27499290744282034,0.0,0.0,0.06570167608247751,0.1631749188187873,0.0,0.16128689226904824,0.0,0.0,0.1045804619669286,0.17172375101613538,0.0,0.13941437118497493,0.0,0.0,0.0782777670848965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401067789868603,0.09101658598649166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09350536903705116,0.06466019085506772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14474158909188262,0.4080004715382744,0.0,0.0,0.08815162755340178,0.0,0.0678855491120032,0.0758788003135932,0.14674898412335907,0.195599057625176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20952846923743235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16630261971818847,0.0,0.0730538883722944,0.0,0.06847867739012067,0.07558415258777242,0.0,0.0769367109143904,0.0,

706577,B0000694WN,A2JDZA9NQRPQUA,0,0,1070755200,Very Entertaining Documentary,"A friend highly recomended this documentary about skateboarding, and I was very doubtful going in because I do not skateboard and am not interested in it.Surprisingly, I found the documentary to be entertaining, informative and definitely interesting.  It's a very unique look into a group of unsung heros who unintentionally gave birth to a new sport and a worldwide counter-culture that has undoubtedly influenced several generations.  This documentary is not just for skaters; anyone interested in the forgotten but influential events in history would like this film.What these guys did in the world of early skateboarding is on the same level as the way the Fosbury Flop changed the high-jump in track and field, but even bigger because it was part of a cutural revolution that gave rise to a whole new genre of sport.  Once the cat was out of the bag, the world could never go back.  Equally important was the early promotion of the sport and the lifestyle, of which the writer/director was an early pioneer. He was also a member of the Z-boys, which provides a perspective that no one else could deliver. He personally knows all the early superstars of the sport and the guys behind the scenes, which seems to make those interviewed very candid and open.You will not be dissatisfied with this film, even if you know nothing about skateboarding or have bo interest in it.",0.0,233,0.1225501161773258,0.0,0.051981916907214536,0.07132625127808263,0.05637133378235599,0.24823428394493804,0.0,0.04718444345108275,0.0,0.10609590483304276,0.150722807753319,0.0,0.0,0.08716816754734145,0.0,0.0,0.07273553820839922,0.0,0.0,0.13744551359045415,0.11595416405763413,0.0,0.04230108075459373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060073630597345495,0.049695142670444364,0.12362114109685506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057956523895437026,0.26606619356442807,0.07283462620831416,0.06992077859743968,0.13601487500500853,0.0,0.05978575355521483,0.05686950020051997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06959429962227298,0.19606536167274677,0.3048975293117531,0.04678096592235937,0.04995947842114207,0.0,0.06218777592426602,0.0,0.060636219429814925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528419852716188,0.5591598537351711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135705835668793,0.0,0.13544398024638044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18580712383885506,0.2720428161152508,0.0,0.07616809267536696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06124012829389673,0.0,0.20948045981112196,0.05927319346739502,0.06542349049589676,0.04454642878015993,0.06659422647423402,0.09775509707213152,

It made not much difference watching it on the big screen or on TV as the movies were rather even-paced.  However, Nemesis was built upon an excellent foundation: a tight script, a great cast that was comfortable in their roles, stunning fighting sequence (not in Star Wars league but still, commendable for the Star Trek franchise).  Not a bad effort at all for the first time Director, Stuard Baird.  A movie that asked the question, what if the worst enemy is none other than yourself.  Would you simply give in & tell yourself that there is nothing that you do would make any difference or you push yourself to be a better person?  That's the question Jean-Luc Picard sought & the answer he found.  Bravery, loyalty, paternity, sacrifice for the common good, family are brought into light.  A definite vintage Star Trek.  The best movie, yet!  Can't help but notice that the uniform for the commanding officers are all into black & purple, not different from the uniform that TV series Enterprise is wearing.  Highly recommended even for a non-Trekkie",0.5,188,0.0,0.0,0.13101384574181132,0.0,0.07103840785252695,0.0,0.12626178980558686,0.05946121039310311,0.0704342218314773,0.0668503266936323,0.0,0.0,0.0928366171065034,0.10984816967243037,0.0,0.07823170283062666,0.09166036142715107,0.0,0.0,0.17320701492776786,0.0,0.08784294954620382,0.26653630716362986,0.07143092433149047,0.0,0.0715421589261428,0.07387524066566611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07789286194947063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303604342758035,0.14369703920162497,0.18357046162324545,0.13216985799595793,0.08570207156993442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407446147895854,0.09365656859742649,0.08736152846412515,0.0,0.0,0.2470789707058742,0.04269198069142533,0.11790550671582273,0.0,0.0,0.1567364223314615,0.08975574583571251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10446365835951418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748123237706783,0.3683901359491221,0.5192127228956895,0.08897320382138582,0.0,0.0,0.07500294680174956,0.0,0.0,0.08003555837107604,0.042671177282501783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11427491733747115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813998659987898,0.0771739981792762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16784232351730835,0.18478451695727846,

While the film doesn't quite have the impact it did back in the 80's , it still holds up very well. This is Charlie Sheen's shinning moment, but it is a shame that Johhny Depp's role was edited out for the most part and reduced to one scene. I have never fought in a war, so I do not know if this is a realistic view of it.

1319364,B0032UYFA6,A39IY0JU5JI69G,0,0,1376784000,Still holding strong,"I'd like to award this three and a half stars, signifying something in between ""I'ts OK"" and ""I like it.""  I am one of many who loved the First Season, was disappointed in the Second one but who has continued to watch it.  It IS addictive!I don't think Season Three matches the quality of Season One but it's no worse than the second one. I found the initial premise of the mild-mannered Walter Mitty type science teacher, hen-pecked by his wife, cheated out of his fair share of his research by Eliot, the hyper-successful entrepreneur, finally coming into his own power to be a wonderful idea.  It's sort of a modern day Odyssey in my opinion.  And it worked really well as a black comedy, especially in the opening shows which were often hilarious.By Season Two Walt is feeling his oats and he's a little less interesting and less likable.  By Season Three I find him to be often annoying, as in ""The Fly.""  Egad!  We are given some relief when he shows his heroism in positive ways, like by saving Jesse.  And then we are shown the ""cute"" moments when he cuddles his baby girl.  I've read that the intention of the writer was to show Walt's shift from a good guy to a bad guy.  And this is what has happened.  I would prefer a more heroic journey...from a powerless wimp to a stong hero who uses his power for good.  But they didn't ask my opinion and I guess that was already done in Superman.Anyway I am addicted and I have continued to watch it in spite of my objections.  There are some nice moments.  I like the lawyer (I live in New Mexico and there ia some business that hires a guy to dress up as the Statue of Libery and wave to people in the street....I'm suprised Saul hasn't done that yet.  Anyway I have to laugh every time I see the statue on his roof.  I also like that little lock of hair that comes down on his forhead...very cute.  It's details like this that are delightful, especially for us locals who know the scene....like Blake's Lottaburgers and the Georgia O'Keefe vagina paintings.  I like Chicken Man, too---he's an original and a break from the usualM Mexican drug thug types. I also loved ""Gale"" the Libertarian chemist with the very good taste in home furnishings!  Ha!  The scene of him singing along to some  obscure Spanish language song was priceless.  I also appreciated the appearance of Jesse's old pals at the 12 seep progrma, especially outside when one said he was alrady on the sixth step!Some of the story lines that were started in earlier seasons were dropped and I wonder if they'll be picked up later---Marie's shoplifting habit and Skyler's helping Ted's cooking the books.  I'd like to see these picked up later...especially all they both involve law breaking.  Marie is also much more interesting in her ditzy mode than in her serious wife mode.The most interesting feature of the series to me is the relationship of Jesse and Walt.  We can see that Jesse needs a good dad and I had to wonder at first why Walt seemed to take such a fatherly interest in Jesse, given that he has a son.  Then I realized that Walt Jr. (aka Flyn) looks up to his DEA Uncle Hank as a role model....which leaves Walt needing a son. I know that's kind of a stretch but it does provide some credibility for his feelings towards Jesse.The ratio between gang related violence and human interactions is still too much loaded for violence for my taste.  And I would like to have more reason for rooting for Walt, since he has become such a prick at times.  It's funny that I don't mind his violent acts as much as I cringe at the way he harps at poor Jesse.I add that I saw this in one fell swoop on Netflix.  I don't know if that affects my opinion of the show or not.  I do know that myy eyes are tired.  But after a break I'll move on to Season Four, hoping for the best.",0.0,699,0.0,0.030842775542170867,0.020781550002729902,0.1140604383704079,0.022536369595789547,0.2356953541041755,0.1001388701866641,0.11318157497114911,0.11172348194241923,0.06362320252564821,0.0,0.0,0.029451678020125223,0.08712114425122322,0.11677251100127978,0.024818385186208297,0.029078520266026045,0.0900060246795118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05573495344848508,0.13529043593220752,0.06798267697575161,0.0,0.09078472246097313,0.0,0.02772739291633793,0.09606595773161976,0.05960200125797799,0.19768712490418117,0.059677021015536,0.06407600994676851,0.31206979091590326,0.0,0.04634020717117007,0.24312929174811432,0.029118134084588725,0.08385967138800321,0.13594150111263695,0.0,0.0,0.22735528667726715,0.0,0.03061998219566349,0.027906006220513008,0.07374997633868516,0.02942192929946129,0.0,0.0,0.0831442491507323,0.12060801267802175,0.027822702654209063,0.019595959325039856,0.23024274952509113,0.09351145940104667,0.11983806608430479,0.0,0.024861691369240973,0.0,0.024241403569369154,0.03149554658753028,0.0,0.026961986457794993,0.07996410727071901,0.033140264334268275,0.0,0.06471353929112969,0.0,0.15035278857258258,0.02618803104300874,0.055505449661471314,0.26712877514863154,0.4000248255788214,0.0,0.0,0.06100830221838565,0.047588176058409315,0.07047372030613737,0.05251447885855384,0.02539064400205018,0.25720473721938175,0.06036806237688059,0.030940941851259923,0.10248507514314413,0.049521837139544174,0.09063202042731099,0.05754068063601403,0.030450801369466533,0.08888449576191006,0.025838516276308933,0.08632149597008468,0.024482836802360724,0.07583910513754016,0.05583132121285159,0.09478594920328488,0.0,0.01780895919614416,0.05324664151334284,0.0,

6489,0767802624,A31TT5GZM82PME,2,2,1103241600,watch it again and again....,"I loved this movie from the first time I saw it several years back.  As some of the other viewer's have remarked, the move is good because it's so enjoyable and humourus.  I know that Will Smith is often cast in the same type of role, but I cannot help but laugh at his character more and more each time that I watch this DVD.  If you're feeling down and just need a laugh, pop this one in the player!Having moved to New York City, I can see how the storyline is at times frighteningly realistic.  Half the people here DO look like the auto guy that Frank the Pug was hanging out with in the movie, and having ridden in way too many cabs, one can certainly understand Jay's assumption that cab drivers are aliens.Having the bonus DVD with this deluxe edition is cool as well to see more of the behind the scenes bits to see how everything was made/done.My final comment is that this one of those excellent movies that gets a little bit funnier every time you watch it, so it's definitly worth buying the DVD to have for your own.  Enjoy!",1.0,196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13866792844820416,0.05596948336877814,0.10543215746612025,0.12488867814909636,0.0,0.08419634543988166,0.0,0.0,0.09738726680555523,0.0,0.138714586486757,0.08126263824348423,0.0,0.2414386606887422,0.0,0.0,0.077878264061692,0.04726021842060165,0.06332797812455693,0.0,0.0634265945437446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11104223604467187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06708524233937663,0.1664500394491915,0.0647510165068235,0.1698618731366901,0.0,0.19529473063727076,0.15196048390535433,0.0,0.06679469462852618,0.06353655634803498,0.0,0.08557039744196665,0.0,0.20610119059868967,0.0,0.10113413859220267,0.08303240064253462,0.0,0.06741006910843791,0.0,0.0,0.1513964347863663,0.0,0.16744932897059156,0.0,0.0,0.07957407750261282,0.06774486427610672,0.08801724383525704,0.0,0.0,0.22346715933807915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250587840279885,0.0700291495514867,0.0,0.0,0.2799436081264045,0.46031452434998593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18344576421817035,0.2128695717077155,0.15132266069831934,0.08435209167304306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131185523722207,0.1608028012440294,0.08509760583664415,0.0,0.0722081447646175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07309336772296214,0.09953759650831186,0.0,0.10921534762097884,

If you are looking for a very good movie to watch, watch this.  I'm not going to tell you what the movie is about, you can read that in the other reviews or in IMBD (which rates this 7.5 out of 10).A ROYAL AFFAIR is the true story of a doctor plucked out of treating Denmark's indigents to become the young king's royal physician. The Danish King Christian VII is ... well, he's peculiar and maybe a little insane.  He has an arranged marriage to one of England's princesses.  Imagine being a well-educated, progressive, 14 year old princess and getting sent off to marry someone who is rude, crude, and repulsive.  Makes you glad to be a commoner, eh?  The King and his wife both come to love this doctor (in different ways) and this doctor influences them to start a revolution to free us, the commoners.Gripping story.  Watch the movie then research the history or research the history then watch the movie.  It is really a great movie.Maybe I should have rated it 5 stars ...",0.0,186,0.07518666898758215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06916962538574387,0.19037016773745344,0.06147013260429733,0.0,0.0,0.06509171860822688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617368887710504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07113993542134377,0.0,0.0519049260126458,0.0,0.0,0.06966012445664096,0.07193183063356097,0.0,0.07371247485509261,0.060977702164670494,0.15168752352820905,0.0,0.0,0.07367834209263538,0.0,0.07111470986272886,0.13991685161709866,0.0,0.2144881865372065,0.0834475372474681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665297652422409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27768386162878206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014478773193876,0.1662755909468913,0.0,0.061302051503687595,0.0,0.15261321227068134,0.08739457292684005,0.14880558260201482,0.0,0.0,0.08275292500037831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16075493340982222,0.0,0.051242717988159034,0.39722098113901094,0.0,0.09125140347442309,0.1872493877920065,0.0,0.0,0.16117976830892827,0.0,0.373937774361998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075997309788442,0.0,0.35321281958185574,0.0,0.0,0.15860944095358134,0.0,0.07514380889085098,0.0,0.0856799840069534,0.07273031011445907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398979406849779,

3665,0767014812,A294XIDCE087BB,10,10,1012694400,Superb in every respect,"If I had to pick one best DVD production, this would be it.  This set and the sequel show what the medium is capable of at its best.  It matches the 1995 A&E; ""Pride and Prejudice"" set artistically, which I frankly did not expect so soon.  Technically, the video and audio are unsurpassed, MUCH better than P&P.;  The accompanying special features, instead of being the useless afterthoughts we so often get, are lengthy, informative, well done, and constitute a real bonus almost as worthy as the episodes themselves.Gruffudd and Lindsay lead a marvelous cast, utterly superb down to the most minor players.  I often was sorry when a great supporting role ended, imagining how much could have been developed with more time.  The tars and midshipmen who worked alongside Hornblower were my favorite supporting actors, along with a few crotchety captains of all nationalities, the best being perhaps the Spanish Prison governor.""Hornblower"" is superbly researched and produced, including a full-sized ship built from authentic plans and materials, and attention to every detail of costume, speech, warfare, terminology, technology, sociology, administration, whatever it took to transport us back 200 years.  The video, videography, and sound are outstanding.  A storm sequence (in the sequel) enveloped the whole room because I wired my DVD player's sound through my stereo (EASY to do and MUCH cheaper than home theater systems).  I felt almost as though I were right on the deck myself and was glad to be warm and dry.""Hornblower"" isn't just about swashbuckling.  Hollywood thinks sex means skin, but here we learn that brains, confidence, and action are sexier than hammering us with sweaty nudity.  My female friends indicate reactions, especially to Gruffudd and Lindsay, that go well beyond my great appreciation of the acting.  In fact, the ""Hornblower"" DVD's are becoming notorious for setting feminine hearts aflutter.  However, guys, there are delectable tidbits for us, too.  I confess to difficulty in maintaining objectivity about the ""Duchess,"" the French schoolmarm, and the Spanish Colonel's lady.  These strong, smart, courageous, women are the sort I would want at my side in any era, and are quite delicious in the bargain, which is how I imagine women react to the male players.  The sexiness fits seamlessly into the proceedings, with nary a gratuitous exploitative scene to cheapen it.  The original Hornblower books did include a French sweetheart, so I can forgive contriving to include the teacher.The appeal of ""Hornblower"" comes from several facets. It respects our intelligence.  Things make sense; they could have happened as depicted.  The characters seem real - good actors make us forget they are acting.  We do not have to suspend disbelief (except that after a while, it seems unlikely that one person could be so lucky).  We identify with the players.  Hornblower reminds me of myself as a young soldier learning to lead and occasionally having to beat the system.  Pellew reminds me of myself as a professor expecting the best of students, but with respect and affection.  The crewmen are so like my students, my fellow grunts in the ditches at the refinery, and my comrades in the Army.  The women are my dreams.  These things are what hooks me, but there is something to hook every viewer, as all my friends who have seen ""Hornblower"" attest.I am brutal about a DVD's weaknesses, so take this as significant:  THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST DVD STUFF.  BUY IT -- YOU WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.",1.0,577,0.08788831205220346,0.0368853530596515,0.04970595515500364,0.0,0.0,0.31154243306648094,0.28741830268390206,0.1804741317546768,0.08016710566528369,0.07608797349432932,0.036030900593735725,0.03445290499863546,0.17610858991697528,0.06251371560785961,0.0,0.029680691308473752,0.0695509056892815,0.0,0.17220170181401062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04044898203252299,0.05420102434819857,0.03313694520470258,0.027142713986756318,0.05605574554050082,0.03315961871668893,0.0,0.09503860880727874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07123046486025295,0.02770948580857998,0.12720841277537112,0.034822827623921804,0.08357423341012161,0.13005963765207088,0.037462286274370406,0.028584055397841306,0.02718977093226619,0.0,0.0,0.10011967540220972,0.02939957972409594,0.035186141027512406,0.0,0.0,0.09943349555591045,0.3173213795694926,0.0,0.04687022263987793,0.16197110051316096,0.022366360578767175,0.047772066551551244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03869596206134664,0.16055259615406836,0.029968204830874864,0.0,0.09956974063660978,0.07986586008024378,0.534677754647816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056911436941830276,0.05618707588675176,0.06280287877441222,0.030365064491262226,0.24283826023187463,0.036097550482345135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043355294887778006,0.03440689567075591,0.0,0.14173112720133146,0.06180136376417215,0.06882214283083189,0.05855880759642833,0.030232386888586177,0.06676954192748027,0.05667799249579591,0.031279503317253744,0.12778806109908283,0.06367848343528519,0.0233687537914075,

629332,B00005JND5,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,3,3,1144368000,RAY IS WORTH SEEING AND LISTENING TO ------,"THE MUSIC SAYS IT ALL: RAY CHARLESBRIEFLY STATED: GREAT MUSIC BY A MAN WHO LIVED [2-disk WS ed.]Jammie Foxx is absolutely convincing and possesses the essence of the man, Ray Charles, as much as is possible in a biopic. A great deal about ""Ray"" that we may have been unaware of is exposed on the screen, for better or worse. However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated. He transcended barriers of all kinds which with the aid of his perserverance, and personality which was all made possible by his priceless musical gift.-----*- AS GOOD A MUSIC VIDEO AS THERE IS *-----*The biopic about a very special human being who created terrificlly popular, though demonized by some, American music that the entire world came to appreciate. If this film is nothing else, it is a moving emotional music video of the great music. Hpwever, the film is much more than that. ""Ray"" is about the struggle of Ray Charles, from early childhood blindness to the difficulty of coping with the pressures of his ambition and his desires. He also had to deal with being blind and black, as well as the exploitation that this lent itself too. There was also the personal toll on himself, which was considerable and included some of his self-indulgences and his convictions too.All in all, ""Ray"" depicts that life was not easy for Ray Charles. Yet, he was able to have his music his own way, which of course was the root of his greatness. He had faults, but for the most part he confronted his demons, and kept himself from becoming a tragic figure. In the end, he was winner in every way, and his music will live on forever as will the example he set. He aimed high, and he reached that goal, and then he cleaned-up his act on a personal level, which is very much to his credit.----- THE ACTORS - THE PRODUCTION CREW - THE MAJOR AWARDS ------ THE ACTORS ------*- Jamie Foxx - Ray Charles-----*- Kerry Washington - Della Charles-----*- Regina King - Margie Hendrix-----*- Clifton Powell - Jeff Brown-----*- Aunjanue Ellis - Mary Ann Fisher-----*- Harry J.

The film is distantemotionally, and we never really get inside any of the characters, even the titular priest, called `Black Robe' by thenative people.  The film is more illustrative than dramatic.  Again, the exact opposite strengths and weaknesses ofBeresord's `Driving Miss Daisy', which was full of wonderfully moving characters, but lacking honest context.But I found the historical context here, and intellectual insight, the suspense inherent to the story, along with thephysical beauty of the locations and the sharply honest insight into the Native universe enough to be always engrossedand interested, and ultimately quite moved.",0.0,219,0.0,0.0,0.0608688970921096,0.08352039530902722,0.0,0.36334142676837483,0.11732219364795185,0.05525123357607093,0.06544733308373973,0.062117185142516754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207069180649056,0.1368100830667672,0.0,0.0,0.08787550259994091,0.0,0.08047179981302664,0.1357780262706347,0.0,0.049532996944539893,0.06637346698296606,0.08115765208905253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0581911692595769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678649403234711,0.044507663761694384,0.08528664641839785,0.16374927783615648,0.03981709372344716,0.09175110068638356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07200424927744804,0.08617645876005305,0.0,0.0,0.08117615135688207,0.0,0.0,0.05739631699369538,0.3173544004789577,0.05477877635178889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08340085318106161,0.0,0.18450011513523207,0.0,0.0789713172926366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534088233449839,0.08128737998492784,0.09780210043721123,0.5858338271025942,0.16534743352338302,0.08708143593890033,0.0893462727517299,0.0,0.06880554511812792,0.07690712216045438,0.0,0.19824984787686892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07252441728993161,0.05309200828538091,0.0,0.0,0.08678052126212993,0.0,0.08427818993850836,0.0,0.07404392655293139,0.08176461681094914,0.06940671156716874,0.0,0.10432443243985941,0.0,0.0572337968464465,
464324,6305428239,A1VQY8XWM19IXB,5,6,967420800,RUSHMORE gets adolescence right.,"First off, RUSHMORE the movie is probably my favorite film of 1998.  It's just one of the most truly honest films of the 90s.  It's a simple tale,  excellently told.  Boy falls in love with teacher who falls in love with  friend of boy...one of the oldest stories in the book, right?  But Wes  Anderson and Owen Wilson have created something more.  And in Max Fischer,  they have created a character that will be held along the lines of classic  characters like Benjamin Braddock (THE GRADUATE), or even Wes Anderson and  Owen Wilson's Dignan (played by Owen Wilson in BOTTLE ROCKET).What  really needs to be said, though, is that the Criterion DVD of this film  simply is one of the best DVDs ever made.  It's got a terrific commentary,  documentaries, interviews, even the MTV Movie Awards reenactments by the  Max Fischer Players.  Other than FIGHT CLUB and Criterion's BRAZIL, I can't  think of a single DVD that holds a candle to it.  It's well worth the extra  price.RUSHMORE is destined to be a classic..one of those movies that  still will be appreciated 20 years later.  And Criterion DVDs are notorious  for going out of print...so, RUSHMORE is destined to be a collector's item.  Now if only Criterion would give the same treatment to BOTTLE ROCKET....",0.8333333333333334,215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17337983876604202,0.05598399059330923,0.0,0.0,0.29641177006429215,0.0,0.0,0.08232679588667074,0.04870625473551986,0.1305665051995635,0.0693752705725477,0.0,0.0,0.16100082753786077,0.1535986446785227,0.12958154819918863,0.07789845001651653,0.0472724682138595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107101806218882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.064767799894458,0.21238237641905594,0.0,0.19534535080269963,0.1899998398559856,0.0,0.06681200773513603,0.06355302494901885,0.15783858654878727,0.0,0.0,0.06871820392862757,0.08224363876223403,0.10116035244246549,0.08305392254352377,0.0,0.06742754171939216,0.0,0.0,0.416448110553556,0.0,0.2233236421873657,0.07719030889928734,0.06949632511106078,0.0795947030102949,0.06776242366557628,0.0,0.0,0.0753673170775969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06254559955916245,0.0,0.0,0.07757768202129757,0.18667744612115184,0.42754570609727094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06566547847237654,0.03669866262907646,0.0,0.18920235419340664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222686103116174,0.0,0.06843730624711115,0.0,0.0,0.06623920959317547,0.14622462687652066,0.09956339653673658,0.0744206388601057,0.0,

1402605,B004EPZ03O,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,4,7,1322956800,Brilliantly Child-Like,"It takes a special movie to make me get fired up, to make me cry, to make me laugh, and to make me feel genuinely happy. It takes an even more special movie to be absolutely perfect, from top to bottom, in terms of acting, direction, effects, sounds, and music. A movie like this doesn't come along all that often, and when it does, I shout it's praise from the rooftops. And I cannot think of a more perfect movie to shout praise towards than Walt Disney Picture's The Muppets, which is undoubtedly the best film I've seen all year.This loving revitalization of Jim Henson's legendary creations kicks off with Gary (Jason Segal, who puts on his best good-boy act here) and his younger brother Walter (a Muppet), who have both been lifelong fans of The Muppet Show. Along with Gary's girlfriend of ten years, Mary (a charming Amy Adams), they travel to California to see just where the Muppets have been since the cancellation of the show. The answer isn't pretty. Kermit is a reclusive shut-in, living in a house built for him and Miss Piggy, who has now given up her beloved frog for a fashion magazine in France. Fozzy is cracking bad jokes at a sadsack casino with a Muppets cover group, Animal has attended anger therapy classes, and Gonzo runs a plumbing business. But the whole gang has to be brought back together for one last show in order to save the Muppet Theater, which is about to be torn down and tapped for oil by tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper at his menacing best.)The Muppets would have been an easy movie to turn into a tongue-and-cheek parody of the source material, like 2009's Land of the Lost. James Bobin, of Da Ali G Show and Flight of the Conchords fame, could have easily pulled off putting sexual themes in different shots. Jason Segal and Nicholas Stoller, who have teamed up for R-rated comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, could have put in subtle pot jokes to elicit laughs from people old enough to get them.However, they didn't. What they did do was make a pure, light-hearted movie that captures everything you've ever loved about Jim Henson's creations, and amplifies it to the umpteenth degree. They've taken the characters we've grown up with and made them more modern, with added layers of pathos that make you genuinely feel for them. Kermit and Piggy's on-again, off-again relationship no longer feels like a running gag, but comes across a genuinely real affair. Hell, even Animal's love of drumming comes across as a primordial desire that he's destined to fulfill. I never thought I'd be saying this, but the Muppets feel like real people.That's especially true for newcomer Walter, who idolizes the Muppets for the way they make him feel empowered and normal. The story between him and Gary is perhaps the crowning achievement of the movie, as he learns to stake out his independence and uncover talents he never knew he had. Jason Segal reacts remarkably well for somebody acting side-by-side with a puppet, conveying a true sense of brotherhood with Walter. That sibling bond is one of the movie's driving strengths.Another strength is just how damned innocent the whole affair is. As I mentioned, this isn't a ""modern reboot"" of the Muppets. It's a Muppet movie made with modern technology and actors, still holding onto the same sensibilities that were on display back in 1979's The Muppet Movie. You've got your music numbers, which are very infectious and will surely be lodged in your skull for weeks. You've got your good-natured humor, which is easily grasped by children and still uproariously funny to adults. But most importantly, you've got your strong moral when all's said and done.Most movie morals are pretty simple, but special attention should be drawn The Muppets' excellent message to kids and adults at the end. That message, without spoiling too much, is that there is honor in losing. As long as you're willing to pick everything back up again and stick by your family and friends, you have a fighting chance, no matter how hard you're kicked down. And even if you don't win, you've at least got people who'll stay by you until the very end. That type of moral has been seen in movies like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights, but rarely in a film with puppets geared towards kids.And it's a moral that applies to The Muppets as well. Opening the same weekend as the utterly dreadful, but sadly bankable Breaking Dawn Part One, Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood may not come in first this winter. But it's put up a better fight than any film I've seen in a while, and shown such effort at crafting a purely entertaining and heartwarming experience that I can't find fault in it. Out of everything I've watched in theaters this year, this has been the only movie to make me walk out feeling completely fulfilled. It is utter perfection, one of the best films I've seen to date.And with that being said, then it should be entirely clear that The Muppets is the best movie I've seen this year. Run, don't walk, to your local theater and shell out the money for this charming, heartwarming, and hilarious landmark.Grade: A+(note: This review originally appeared on my Tumblr blog, Dem Reviews)",0.5714285714285714,906,0.04146574411397026,0.0,0.05276540567067271,0.0,0.03814732086585913,0.3464666613972132,0.033901020267869446,0.11175645389272072,0.09455718889844489,0.12564418725180862,0.0,0.12191171749388445,0.12463216476552537,0.11797599359829904,0.09883043554428854,0.021005044735502885,0.02461061082126836,0.05078441004315159,0.0,0.06975856907277425,0.05885093191759189,0.02358564390335863,0.15744174134881808,0.05753715080175482,0.07035311366456957,0.038417833035580586,0.0,0.023467083947516256,0.1016318006072844,0.11770305029239995,0.08365626673714446,0.025253828698119048,0.10846148492790213,0.10158473972491616,0.05040984677109319,0.019610021308392983,0.20577251949970649,0.024644137983684856,0.1537784036935766,0.12655952512398191,0.0,0.04045790956239177,0.11545331249422888,0.04778945788728572,0.0,0.11809126674704715,0.06241830564775083,0.04980251023611464,0.19908686656425612,0.02514658817310674,0.023456383373422703,0.020415322614702233,0.047095498722376165,0.016585043675053163,0.2177914030329843,0.06331475229396213,0.067616645757592,0.02337123701566378,0.0,0.0,0.0820668649641136,0.07996878444063606,0.0,0.0,0.022559212157356553,0.0,0.0,0.10954063107685819,0.0,0.0,0.02216424475105735,0.04697704723558332,0.19782392574228755,0.3983071559795407,0.0,0.07548826269593123,0.025817193740034234,0.020138130653708952,0.09940907628231091,0.11111409640568849,0.0,0.30934223330474453,0.025546260187924278,0.0,0.13010739248051795,0.04191281570883438,0.015341285335539,0.0,0.025772041178287353,0.02507580295499445,0.043736865731658595,0.024352737844453014,0.020721053300896547,0.04279096011988666,0.09450569736260488,0.12033315755884687,0.022136525044335685,0.15072615796761452,0.022532652277968884,0.18191890649375148,
88925,0790729385,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,20,20,1072137600,STILL ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL HORROR FILMS EVER,"Thirty years later and I still find &quot;The Exorcist&quot; a powerful, disturbing, and amazing work of art.  William Friedkin's direction is superb, the score including Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS still one of the best, and the whole project an exercise in terror.  Let's go beyond the obvious special effects and the frightening possession of Regan McNeil, and look at the stunning performances Friedkin elicited.Ellen Burstyn is outstanding; her mother role goes from the pampered movie star trying to stay close to her daughter to the pure terror of seeing her child possessed by Satan.Jason Miller in his guilt-ridden role of Father Karras is mesmerizing.  Tormented and doubting his faith, he nonetheless conquers these and propels the movie's grueling climax.Max von Sydow as Father Merrin is brilliant in his subtle performance of a man near death faced with the unbelievable task of exorcising not just a demon, but the devil himself.Linda Blair's performance is all the more amazing in that as everyone knows, Mercedes McCambridge mouthed the demon's voice, but Linda was there physically and her agony (especially in those awful hospital tests) demonstrates what potential she had, that was unfortunately never fully tapped in later films.Kitty Winn as Burstyn's personal assistant was also very good in a supporting, almost invisible role.And let's not forget Lee J. Cobb as Kinderman, a cop with a heart and soul a great pickup line.THE EXORCIST has never been duplicated for its gut-wrenching horror and it's ability to creep under your skin no matter how often you've seen it.A true classic in any genre.",1.0,258,0.0,0.0,0.055375754718325135,0.07598305777762779,0.06005175142441381,0.3636066588657478,0.0,0.20106023960076025,0.05954100759094417,0.0,0.0,0.0767656756856886,0.07847869373898014,0.09285927400413957,0.0622317962442682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04506286823488303,0.06038356209891029,0.0,0.060477593376212065,0.06244984541437074,0.07388406104992452,0.06399576681513598,0.0,0.06584610951918177,0.31803788241421355,0.0,0.19189840020248722,0.07935549650486053,0.0,0.3239283889535454,0.0,0.18621455862417213,0.07244756257993686,0.08347097925985172,0.06368909462175537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655061917851305,0.0,0.09643193607082803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413802904874686,0.10443311850281978,0.2526252773476688,0.0,0.05322127361795413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24603851052407394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453356385975767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897590367955038,0.4702632146610757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06340314280110912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442869573583631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659794169895895,0.14490208474776115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523842376522525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490962474933706,0.0,0.052068705811627314,

His living existence is on the bland side with a nagging, pessimistic girlfriend and a group of low energy friends.  There are some interesting scenes here and there about why we should stay in reality if the dreaming is better and even a change around of love interests for the main character but it suffers greatly in that it tends to me more vignettes and half focuses than a fully fleshed out tale.  That said, it was engaging enough for me to finish unlike lower quality films.

1451051,B0059XTUB8,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0,0,1335398400,"Uneven, but This Is More Interesting than the ""The Prince and the Showgirl"".","""My Week with  Marilyn"" follows the behind-the-scenes social intrigues of the cast and crew of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", Laurence Olivier's attempt at light comedy on the silver screen and Marilyn Monroe's attempt to work with serious folks, in 1956. The film's troubled production, which was apparently far more engaging than the movie itself, was recorded for posterity by Colin Clark, whose first job in the film industry was third assistant director on that film, essentially a factotum and assistant to Laurence Olivier. Clark was 23 years old at the time and enamored of Marilyn Monroe. He published a diary of his time on the set as ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me"" in 1995, followed by a memoir from which this film takes its name in 2000.Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) is from an old and monied English family that doesn't think much of his aspiration to a career in movies. But his persistence gets him a job with Laurence Olivier Productions, whose next film will be ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me"". Colin couldn't be happier at the prospect of meeting the glamorous, beautiful and very American Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). The production is off to a rocky start, when Marilyn is late to the first read-through, and it's clear that she is more than a little nervous, insecure, and doped-up. Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) becomes frustrated with Monroe's personal problems and her ""method"" approach to acting. Meanwhile, Marilyn finds Colin a down to earth person to talk to in her time of crisis.Laurence Olivier is intimidating and perhaps not as tolerant as he could have been of Marilyn's perpetual emotional turmoil, but I found him the most sympathetic character. He is bedeviled by Marilyn Monroe's dysfunction, which is creating a hellish working environment for him. But trying to compete with Marilyn's screen presence and sexuality leaves him in awe of her on one level.  He was a middle aged man seeking to renew and rediscover his strengths through a beautiful younger woman, but seeing himself on screen with her only made him feel old. And working with her nearly drove him mad. It's nice to see Kenneth Branagh playing a forceful character who is not always nice. I liked him in this role a lot.Michelle Williams is perfectly competent as Marilyn Monroe: childlike, witty, dreadfully insecure, preyed upon, but manipulative and toxic to those whose emotions she toys with. Colin Clark was too green to understand that he could get hurt trying to be Marilyn's friend -and that no one, especially not a man, could really be her friend. But he was captivated by her, and she thought him innocent enough to be trusted. Colin Clark's character, while a reasonably good lens through which to see the others, is unfortunately the film's weakness. He is flat and doesn't have as much stake in how the production turns out as the other characters, which makes him less compelling. This is a star-packed cast that works nicely, but our guide, Colin, is the weak point.The DVD (Weinstein 2012): Bonus features are a behind-the-scenes documentary and an audio commentary. ""The Untold Story of an American Icon"" (31 min) interviews director Simon Curtis and the cast about the film, the characters, and performances. Then it goes to Pinewood Studios, where filming for both Olivier and Monroe's film and this film took place, for a look behind the scenes. The audio commentary with director Simon Curtis is constant scene-by-scene commentary about story, characters, locations, and changes made to the book, which seem minor. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH and Spanish.",0.0,601,0.052432180540250825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07235420191428804,0.35844269302618875,0.04286681580579118,0.12112513646932775,0.07173882498394399,0.11348091316245941,0.0,0.03083073663910368,0.0,0.13052994434188306,0.12496809957364112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03081949297247066,0.0,0.24805075074211175,0.059646668146120456,0.09049105673483444,0.04850265913179571,0.02965312883401437,0.024289094537292093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04252341448130514,0.18511643781072812,0.22352892339157754,0.30857910866108995,0.10276066719076099,0.03187086405158529,0.0,0.16262070841802292,0.0,0.20940569465815936,0.04364473513902961,0.03352372991681158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05972913546458717,0.052617374343895455,0.031486884702714074,0.01936456364151335,0.031797100938059736,0.05931977607715379,0.025814558595148827,0.02977541756947319,0.06291385982474325,0.14494244660253863,0.10007448901718338,0.042749602758169275,0.02955222304189698,0.0,0.03047274262605653,0.025942767772019072,0.0,0.0,0.0288542926710205,0.057050884287969755,0.0,0.10185145983197232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05605203558540337,0.05940105681292108,0.10720387578436519,0.4406914433627011,0.0,0.0,0.03264506141502109,0.0,0.0,0.056200167032305265,0.08151800027282889,0.27525645321861436,0.03230247412466412,0.0,0.02741947776382098,0.026498744531820377,0.13579014237755738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027053938069094834,0.17924939822298874,0.02535960697566993,0.027990967061106025,0.1715298052888524,0.0,0.0,

1400708,B004EPYZT4,A1NGWU5RWYVKUL,1,1,1336780800,Please Don't Buy this Movie,"I'm a life-long fan of the Conan franchise from Robert E. Howard's 1930s novels, to the Marvel Comics interpretations, the two 1980s films, the short-lived 1990s TV series and even the 1994 TV animated series. This 2011 film, however, is one of the very worst adaptations of any classic super-hero character ever! It's nothing but a montage of fast-paced fight scenes strung together by the thinnest possible pretense of acting, plot and dialogue. I am no purest looking to see my childhood (and adulthood) fantasies presented exactly as I remember then from long ago. I'm fine will all versions of the Conan epic that have exercised considerable license with Howard's original. But this movie is just plain bad on every level. It is an insult to anyone with the vaguest glimmer of intelligence.I fell especially strong about this because I am such a fan of this film genre. So long as those of us who enjoy these kinds of movies pay good money to see films that insults the characters and stories we grew up on, and which insults us on the assumption that we'll accept trash like this just so long as it can be connected to memories and enjoyments we still value, our old heroes will continue to be treated like the cheap raw material for a fast buck by talentless movie-makers literally banking on our gullibility. I strongly urge anyone with any fond connections to the Conan legacies please not pay a penny to encourage this type of hack-job.",1.0,252,0.06689156974477782,0.0,0.056746613201653216,0.0,0.0615383668809003,0.2032406998315847,0.0,0.15452820062983802,0.0,0.11582072443743405,0.0822690791444983,0.0,0.0,0.09515805844819404,0.12754475991453876,0.06776969495857613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502192935614477,0.1265825981108898,0.0,0.04617842531427832,0.12375678343688343,0.0,0.06197475079379956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054250231751828464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144946439232792,0.11136156514808904,0.0,0.13053150917934994,0.12416439111357022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09881916380792828,0.08113177720873739,0.0,0.06586704306041402,0.07597335836526209,0.05350921004387504,0.4068101095011477,0.20427575867464087,0.05453879668926595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455679762324728,0.18098724698881716,0.0,0.0,0.12219617071455359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13676782960486153,0.4176508695956938,0.0,0.0,0.08329538767853015,0.0,0.0,0.21509599757101536,0.0,0.2957177270416119,0.0,0.08448809925619825,0.06996206872594209,0.06761277519780347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24271019726452167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07622719164323065,0.06470621291101711,0.14284050032627502,0.1458887501983534,0.0,0.0,

The movie quality was not great. It appeared to have been taped with a hand held video camera. The piont was to depict white trash and it did that in spades. This is the first time I have ever seen Olivia Newton-John play a trampy type of roll and it was hard to believe since I have always seen her in more angelic types of rolls.

I don't think this movie is bad, but I don't this is the strongest either. The dragons don't talk and there aren't a lot of interesting side characters. The viking students are okay I guess, but there's no Furious Five in there. I do wish there was an actual treacherous villain instead of a Giant volcanic dragon. I think the story and characters are obviously too similar to ""Ratatouille"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"", but that doesn't mean it's bad, just not as good as those films are. The side characters are kind of forgettable, but the only one I ever got sucked into was Astrid; all stone hearted and hard-core, but softens into a kinder viking because of Hiccup in the end.

267889,6301798503,A319KYEIAZ3SON,2,3,1091145600,"Bergman as the &quot;notorious&quot; Alicia Huberman, &quot;not a lady.&quot;","Filmed in 1946, just after World War II, this was a truly sensational film upon its release, its a dramatic impact far stronger than what we experience now. Newspapers were publicizing the fact that major Nazi leaders had escaped to Brazil and other South American countries, and America's use of the atomic bomb in Japan had made every American aware of the importance of uranium, also a plot element here. The work of spies was respected and considered crucial for America's safety.In this Hitchcock-directed film, Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia Huberman, daughter of a Nazi spy convicted of treason. A young woman who has always played fast and loose, she is nevertheless recruited to go to Brazil to infiltrate her father's Nazi network there, with Devlin (Cary Grant) as her agency contact. They fall in love as they await orders in Rio, but the stiff and formal Grant cannot bring himself to tell this &quot;notorious&quot; woman (&quot;not a lady&quot;) that he loves her. When she realizes that she will get much better information if she marries Nazi Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains), Grant allows her to do this, meeting her periodically for agonizing updates. As Alicia uncovers increasingly important information related to the Nazi search for uranium, her own life is threatened.Hitchcock's camera work is extraordinary, with high-contrast scenes achieving maximum dramatic impact in black and white. He often places objects and people in the extreme foreground with the camera focused on the background, and he uses changes of lighting to emphasize changing moods or realizations by characters. The suspense builds to a crescendo, and when Grant and Bergman manage to get inside a locked wine cellar while Rains is approaching, the tension nears the breaking point.Part of the suspense is psychological. Alicia's life is nightmarish, as she shares a bedroom with someone she both fears and detests, while she herself is feared and detested by her husband's manipulative mother (Leopoldine Konstantin), who calmly sits and embroiders throughout much of the film. Playing a fey, flighty, and &quot;fallen&quot; woman, Bergman is spontaneous, vibrantly alive, and expressive of every emotion, a marked contrast to the staid Grant, who plays the elegant and formal role for which he is justifiably famous. Rains, playing a Nazi, manages to evoke a certain sympathy because he is so vulnerable to Bergman and so dependent on his mother. One of Hitchcock's best films, this study of a &quot;notorious&quot; woman belongs to Bergman, who dominates the film and brings it to life.

1190548,B001FB55KI,A9I40WFF40R4,4,6,1229126400,"""If A Bullet Should Go Through My Brain, Let That Bullet Go Through Every Closet Door.""","Harvey Milk, along with Supreme Court Justice Douglas, will always be my hero. As the first openly gay person to be elected to pubic office anywhere in the United States in 1977, after many unsuccessful campaigns in San Francisco, Milk brought hope to many gay people throughout the United States. It is so appropriate 30 years from the date of his assassination by Dan White that this fine film is released, on the heels of the passage of Proposition 8 in California that prohibits same-sex marriage but also just after the victory of Barack Obama who ran a campaign to unite all kinds of people, just as Milk did in California thirty years ago. He ran a campaign of hope that appealed to all of what he called the ""uses"" of the world, minorities, gays, the disabled, the elderly, the unions.This movie is worthy of such a hero. The director Gus Van Sant looks at both Milk's political career and his personal life that was not always happy-- specifically his relationship with Jack Lira (Diego Luna). There are so many touching moments in the film, for instance, Milk's telephone conversation with a young gay man who who has seen Milk's picture in the media. He is about to be taken by his parents to an institution to be ""fixed"" because of his homosexuality. When Milk tells him to run away and go to any large city, he explains to Milk that he uses a wheelchair.The acting is superb: Josh Brolin as Dan White, Fames Franco as Scott Smith, Allison Pill as Anne Kronenberg and especially Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones. Then there is Sean Penn who becomes Harvey Milk. He is perfect as the character, even bearing a striking resemblance to Milk. The cinematography is so good that it is impossible to separate the documentary footage from  the rest of the film. Puccini and Judy Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"" are nice touches as well.This so sad but yet hopeful film should be seen by every gay and lesbian  who was not alive in 1978 as well as the rest of the world. I was glad to see that Randy Shilts' wonderful biography of Milk has been re-released also. In 1987 when the AIDS quilt was first unfurled in Washington, D. C., I remember seeing painted on a subway wall the words ""Harvey Milk lives."" Even though, as Milk predicted, a bullet did go through his brain, this film is proof positive that Harvey is very much alive today.",0.6666666666666666,419,0.03711943597473414,0.09347068814951975,0.06297960366481653,0.08641657144750857,0.03414883935510588,0.09398518843808462,0.06069524510895633,0.31441927279233095,0.03385840137940889,0.16067794423520368,0.045652715695806305,0.04365332675228176,0.0,0.052805061557454416,0.10616561027699989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08326226201781874,0.17560787794412236,0.08445388524921116,0.02562530836707142,0.06867505153118442,0.0,0.034390997294844364,0.0,0.0,0.07278326138839096,0.0,0.22466304440357415,0.0,0.04854644757417294,0.21824867670228895,0.0,0.0,0.23025511859666917,0.0,0.2329628024803595,0.04119780218775515,0.0,0.07243447890601443,0.0,0.0,0.1391932514167593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02741834014391273,0.0,0.04199551892451091,0.0365509061463903,0.0,0.05938660742633519,0.2667917433386253,0.05667830022710405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544894586923766,0.0,0.0,0.040389253790495294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356180742208002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202387025800755,0.4635252176888763,0.0,0.0,0.0462222343072647,0.07210926198710942,0.0,0.0795739746251278,0.0,0.2871741795781518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03751964693914053,0.10986608265704519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830501161631749,0.0,0.03709827607181643,0.07661149406130606,0.0,0.1795336943416197,0.03963248901685472,0.08095651130753337,0.0,0.0,
928750,B000AMJG4Y,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,26,80,1127520000,What is wrong with these people?,"I can't believe all of these rave reviews of this movie. To me, I think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I myself have played the Final Fantasy 7 game to death and know who everyone is already. I am a big fan of the game since it has a decent story, but FF7 Advent Children fell way short for me.The major problem with the movie is it is predictable beyond all reason. The plot was basically a repeat of a dummied down version of the game. The only major difference is there is a virus Geostigma killing those who have Jenova's cells within them, Cloud has a couple of kids, and there isn't a gigantic meteor coming to destroy the world. There were no twists, the plot was extrememly linear and unoriginal. How many movies have the bad guys taking advantage of little children? How many movies have copied fight scenes from The Matrix? How many movies have a bad guy who's sanity is questionable? The answer to that is TOO MANY.I found it sad about how the movie handled all of the heros. You find out nothing about what happened during the past two years of their life. I guess nothind did since they just popped into the movie to save the day when the big bad monster appeared. I also found it strange how Cloud was still moping over the death of Aerith, and didn't want to fight. The movie gave no explanation why he became such a sissy in the past two years in the first place- no tramatic events, nothing.If you want the plot here it is- three guys like Sephiroth search for Jenova. They attack the heros. The badies steal several children. Another fight like The Matrix. The bad guys summon a big bad monster which the good guys beat. Then the badies find Jenova's head. Sephiroth comes back to destroy the world and gets beaten by Cloud again. All the people are cured from their virus by magical water and happily ever after.The only reason to watch this movie is to say that you have. The 3D graphics are good. Some of the visuals were stunning, but then again there was nothing original. You aren't missing out on much.",0.325,381,0.07521437383658347,0.04734944845354055,0.127614316590092,0.04377604440806221,0.0,0.11426418930118676,0.06149278317207517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05349892227820449,0.07170708722871869,0.03810087871202567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04278180641948444,0.051924051984802405,0.06957744458494745,0.0,0.06968579287972011,0.0,0.0,0.07373963649176135,0.2135005994843849,0.03793585436961103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285950210892562,0.03557045713635003,0.04665613609997957,0.04470180016764063,0.21456722133021697,0.12521742910255626,0.0,0.03669313549647834,0.06980660616906004,0.0,0.18802967542782317,0.08568191285351232,0.0,0.0,0.1666717096913776,0.18245276181400358,0.042547341802276706,0.0,0.12813920945886442,0.0,0.24950529048129252,0.028711527733107284,0.030662320068397846,0.08478579104178155,0.0,0.0,0.0744302073060789,0.04835157450805043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03846995764388817,0.04020354213177876,0.0,0.05126159994932842,0.6321753287033366,0.08666453943251859,0.045642513935360896,0.09365919280441495,0.1461135614202293,0.07212692390804676,0.040309789992438304,0.0,0.18703778163871398,0.04633815224972195,0.09500030432002494,0.0,0.0,0.11130972758520156,0.04416787146849657,0.04674769454004445,0.0,0.0,0.08834646368060191,0.037585748973363343,0.0388090861511773,0.04285577772088719,0.10913566476331846,0.0,0.027340094419066773,0.0,0.11999316924311788,

One of my all time favorite films is finally coming out in a format that will hopefully give it the justice that it so richly deserves!I remember being a very young and deeply impressionable boy, staying up past my bedtime and watching this wonderful movie on our old black and white TV.  How I loved it!  I think the honor and love depicted in the movie affected me the most.  Of course the adventurous story was great!  Even as a child I always thought that a better actor than Tony Curtis would have been better in his crucial role.  I thought the same for his role in another of my all time favorites, the Vikings.  But he was very very popular at that time.  I mean look at his part in probably one of my top 5 films of all time as well.  Spartacus!  He was getting so very many of the real plum jobs at that time.I broke down and paid a small fortune for a crappy Japanese DVD copy a few years back.  I originally had been lucky enough to find a VHS copy of it.  But now, finally on Blu-Ray where it deserves!I can't wait for September!",0.0,210,0.0,0.0,0.17127824672913475,0.0,0.0,0.1704003344728932,0.0,0.10364718127673625,0.184161451894185,0.0,0.0,0.23743767299068583,0.0,0.09573849136004693,0.0,0.06818306784597698,0.0,0.0,0.07911702726833247,0.07547953849213525,0.0,0.0,0.18584039418494516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438618059164956,0.07617492831311655,0.0,0.10916228070543497,0.13577550018351126,0.0,0.0,0.19784844892254536,0.08181601243365462,0.0,0.20873261986815952,0.0,0.038397674552485744,0.18673472355078244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756307807199848,0.0841216826890781,0.07666562917642376,0.0,0.08083029522402184,0.0994219282603696,0.0,0.0,0.26507524158384993,0.0,0.0,0.26045823846954763,0.1027608868648071,0.10974293088304893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06659793745043915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18441229085009989,0.0,0.07194586932071118,0.07624452218979666,0.22933678076401018,0.25858363247176364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0721360041768281,0.3487761169100718,0.07438037701977565,0.0,0.0,0.07038881437346871,0.2721007637047498,0.14939495421919718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07098565418695997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718558902386443,0.0,0.07314173230118468,0.0,

381012,6303593283,A2RFG9LI7JDILS,13,15,1101859200,What movie did the other reviewers watch?,"Luchino Visconti is a master of the epic, however, his epic style always takes place within a family and always leads downward towards an inevitable doom. His movies tends to remind us of the 'Godfather' but Visconti, dare I say, even gets closer to the marrow of the issues than Coppola does at his best (I am nevertheless, a big fan of 'the Godfather'). To Visconti the finest details of a film are of the utmost importance - you can watch a film like 'Rocco' or the 'Leopard' several times and still miss things. Visconti's cinema is one which reveals itself in every character, in every piece of furniture, in every moment.'Rocco and his Brothers' is if not my favorite Italian film - certainly one of the top ten. To see the brilliant camera work of Giussepe Rotuno combined with Visconti at his peak is simply magnificent. The film itself is extremely radical in structure - slowly revealing itself - focusing sometimes on what appear to be small conversations - but everything is woven to make a perfect whole - wherein the seams are all neat - and though at times are barely hanging together - it always holds as if there is some greater purpose in mind. Visconti reveals much about both the family and their society. One could be bold and comment that the whole film is about fighting to survive (sometimes fighting one another). Life - sometimes- is like a boxing match but the match is sometimes not the one you choose to fight - you are thrown into it and some of the factors working for or against you are money, pride, love, and family.",0.8666666666666667,279,0.11072953564585566,0.0,0.046967997262350056,0.0,0.05093403260773655,0.224290827703761,0.22632201063752366,0.04263326446371173,0.15150250659808678,0.09586241647532051,0.0,0.0,0.06656319343067027,0.11814053323683947,0.0,0.05609157388783108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06209409819920269,0.26192449144084873,0.0,0.03822092687775546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2712704498327176,0.0,0.10473264618213465,0.17171625654310074,0.06580935694354136,0.3158828235988102,0.06144777508183323,0.0,0.0,0.10276829669428851,0.06380814565972649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715109281127207,0.06263759385895602,0.054516788290908794,0.0,0.08857693134638096,0.3060984617138442,0.042268704389901345,0.2257031661511283,0.0,0.11237889878421102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060241800553600566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11326985332560385,0.0,0.0627234207121951,0.03773330062672093,0.45204435930404774,0.06379315361432406,0.0,0.0,0.053776578805189976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447594422025202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06502331467650516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055333207184102604,0.0,0.06309166884891,0.0,0.0,0.0402496996932339,0.0,0.17665224388935166,

914183,B0009W5IQ0,A1FG91CM8221X1,28,33,1113696000,"A droll, poignant voyage of discovery.","Michael Schorr's ""Schultze Gets the Blues"" is a quiet, droll and unexpectedly poignant film that--like its protagonist--takes its own sweet time getting to its destination, but both the journey and the destination are hard to forget. Schultze (Horst Krause) is a bored, phlegmatic retiree and polka accordionist in an ugly, dull German mining town. One day, however, he hears a snatch of zydeco music over the radio, and from then on zydeco and the land of its birth--the Louisiana bayou country--become his twin obsessions. An invitation to a polka festival in Texas gives him the excuse he dreams of, and soon he's playing hooky from the festival, puttering into the bayous in a rented shrimp boat. ""Schultze Gets the Blues"" is reminiscent of ""Stroszek,"" Werner Herzog's story of Germans lost in the vast strangeness of America, only much more benign. It  is odd and asymmetrical (except for the matching shots at the beginning and end), never taking us precisely where we expect to go--kind of like life. Schorr makes Schultze a courtly, portly, lovable Everyman, and what begins as comedy ends as a moving tribute to the philosophy of Carpe Diem. ""Schultze Gets the Blues,"" with its Teutonically deliberate pacing and schnapps-dry wit, is not for every taste. But those who are willing to follow Schultze and Schorr wherever they lead will be rewarded in the end.",0.8484848484848485,227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127127263110804,0.36714201677611463,0.10777217844037247,0.1015075770212547,0.06011992650523055,0.05706085228410523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09376214737264592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062362854036934735,0.0,0.09100203157489412,0.12194134638939673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19945899935781358,0.0,0.08620043301938843,0.06458807793952273,0.0,0.0,0.20442372119646965,0.07834432165465215,0.18802512808654415,0.03657598614816981,0.42141284985452254,0.0,0.12234297470837442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06614311035540088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07456842049329773,0.0,0.0,0.05272426234567519,0.29152178299602344,0.05031978925867374,0.053738745578649175,0.07429773812476029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07046067998640687,0.0,0.044920509463839055,0.506491303791101,0.0,0.0,0.08207349479737351,0.0,0.06320478040505367,0.0,0.06831525587926353,0.21853479533744405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07971659523069338,0.0,0.0,0.0658727388194042,0.0,0.0,0.06375701196332818,0.0703725583559805,0.04791621686829664,0.0,0.0,

1461084,B005HK8KXM,A328S9RN3U5M68,19,21,1318204800,"Tchaikovsky, Gergiev, Mariinsky Orchestra: Wonder","Likely every classical music lover owns at least one of the sets of Valery Gergiev conducting the Tchaikovsky symphonies 4 -6 (and probably many other recordings of other conductors and orchestras of these popular masterworks), but until seeing the live performances captured in January 2010 in the Salle Pleyel in Paris and hearing how Gergiev is committed to these scores then the zenith has not been experienced.  Not usually one to purchase a DVD of a orchestral performance until the recent spate of excellent ones, the actual close-the-eyes experience of truly hearing the performance is the test.  Have n fear.  This is an exception release.  Not only is Gergiev and his 'own' orchestra splendid in the symphonies 5 and 6 as he has been in his previous recordings, here he manages to prove that he has captured the special essence of the 4th symphony as well - not always the case in live or recorded performances in the past.The sound is breathtaking, the orchestra is playing at its inimitable best, and being able to observe Gergiev's facial expressions of total involvement in these performances is, well, a wonder.  This is Tchaikovsky restored to the master he has always been.  Included in this experience is an informative interview with Gergiev in which he speaks form the heart about his honoring the master of Russian music.  This is a quiet interview, reflective, informative and adds to the experience of starting from the top and viewing this gold standard of Tchaikovsky symphonic performances again. This is an experience the listener and viewer will never forget.

251552,6301404440,AUTBHG6070SL4,2,2,1124150400,A modern classic,"If you haven't seen it, this is a brilliant merger of live-actors and animated characters. Oh, it's been done before, all the way back to the 1930s or -40s, but never so well. The animated figures don't just talk to the live actors and cast shadows, they open doors, bump into things, and visibly press against the actors they are supposed to be touching. Just a few minutes in, disbelief is thoroughly suspended. The technical achievement sinks into the background (as it should), and the plot moves on.The story's a good one, too. There are lots of ins and outs, a complex land grab, a personal tragedy, and loyalties that surface under pressure. It's kid-safe and -comprehensible, but has enough to keep an adult interested.Not least is the remarkable legal feat of combining dozens of cartoon characters, with copyrights owned by competing studios. Disney, Warner Bros, and Hanna Barbera all contributed. Who ever expected to see Daffy Duck across from Donald? Bugs across from Mickey? Even minor characters appeared, like animated extras from Fantasia, Peter (of wolf fame), and the dragon from Disney's 1941 adaptation of Grahame's book, ""The Reluctant Dragon"". Of course, Roger, his wife Jessica (""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way""), and lots of other `toons all came to life exclusively for this movie.It's not necessary to have kids in order to have a collection of kids' movies. This one's great for the kid in anybody.//wiredweird",1.0,240,0.0,0.0,0.17321768977474183,0.0,0.06261480137878071,0.344659673226525,0.11128989414878838,0.052410407145317306,0.0,0.058923335341608346,0.0,0.08004208739552524,0.0,0.09682257153257927,0.06488789200735026,0.0,0.0,0.0833572496263134,0.0,0.07633421950860844,0.0,0.0,0.09397236474066452,0.2518430958421257,0.0,0.06305881855726653,0.0651152476656438,0.0,0.06672715005250358,0.11039836310468779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06669625186374155,0.0,0.0643755609247832,0.12665770306968607,0.16180300686654162,0.11649739425268067,0.18884918564903508,0.0,0.1992221666384734,0.06316814275344727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050273858633800184,0.08255094135442971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16333559348351412,0.33866678252540894,0.05196224202970453,0.11098558818583099,0.0,0.06907544981496973,0.07911267113100916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405713200471928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06216681841222283,0.0,0.07276053737447093,0.0,0.09277345629802261,0.4249564551497052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06610923243893832,0.13053560617905846,0.10942923779035121,0.0,0.3008904473973283,0.08386298022145558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920834311574945,0.0,0.07178944939142916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06583805964883219,0.0,0.04948021632719899,0.0,0.054291033901798215,

There Babe learns his life lessons and, ""the way things are"" according to each animal along with his roll,purpose and supposed destiny on the Hogget farm.

With Fly on the injured list and Rex not able to compete any longer, Hogget enters  Babe into the ""Sheep Dog""  competion as nothing less than just ""pig"". This is a film which shows that nothing short of persistance, believing in one self and having a big heart will out weigh all the odds stacked against you.

I must become Caligari!""","Robert Wiene's ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism.  While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success.Francis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story.  A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival.  The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis's friends.  Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events.In a strange way, one can look upon ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" as a bizarre version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939).  The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity.  Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is stiff and dreary.  The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in.  Give ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar.",0.5,255,0.0,0.07825740472729756,0.0,0.0,0.11436310549485212,0.2518021279382929,0.20326596307565659,0.09572524050869696,0.05669522012995483,0.053810404787649306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04421051300426104,0.0,0.06297171315011832,0.07378095807940234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05881038023638713,0.0,0.17163627809700818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06093706226633002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12181769038700786,0.0,0.05878952662322271,0.15422304778779158,0.0,0.10638861335835587,0.10347735135505787,0.07948144875398377,0.06064504759921352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09944169374915908,0.48110189226274913,0.04745334358759134,0.10135508099212599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08408682529983212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13289383386016237,0.0,0.12708489449902272,0.5970490491169758,0.0,0.0,0.0773982126203524,0.06037276296591541,0.0,0.03331125971832448,0.0,0.24043372787121733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09198428583880375,0.0,0.07726284827325763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04518668968942239,0.0,0.04958006015203978,

Any free time I  had I went out looking for specific Japanese crafts/craftsmen(women). I found a couple of hands full.  Unfortunately, I never found a sword-maker or any of their lot.  I did find a knife and carving tool maker who was most interesting to watch and ask questions of.Now comes this DVD.... horribly expensive for my poor wallet....but never-the-less... I'm very happy with it.It is NOT a Japanese product...there you must watch the craft-person's face for 1/2 of the video.  Next, you get to see maybe 10 min. of actual hand/tool work....and the rest is preparing some food for everyone involved.)So with that relief...I tell you that I got to see much of all that is involved in making all facets of the trade.(Face and food viewing was minimal or non-existant.) The various parts of construction were great...but WAY to short for my likes.  I like and want to see excessive details in all of this.  Even making the hand grips was just kind of hinted at. Seeing and hearing a knife cut a piece of Magnolia wood is music to my ears....I realize the blade is the ""soul"" of the warrior, etc.... but there are many parts to the thing and for the price I wished to see so much more.  The hand guard was not even mentioned....I only saw ONE in the whole DVD!So, I gave the DVD a 5 rating...which it does deserve.  NO doubt.  In spite of not enough detail.... it is a superbly made and assembled flick.  Thank you who done it.!!",0.9285714285714286,274,0.0,0.0,0.13551525987713478,0.0,0.0,0.24267718108052258,0.043533310445614266,0.041002798004062584,0.048569481704737995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362236697885356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18779205268132879,0.11943874332557605,0.0,0.0,0.2205552350743277,0.0,0.060228353282099696,0.0,0.0509423126520674,0.060269563728072434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13211931236546104,0.0,0.18228132100931754,0.1477444163127617,0.0,0.0519532073974031,0.09883802621223495,0.0,0.13311406332808015,0.0,0.05343547098351181,0.06395288761071603,0.0,0.0,0.12048416375177488,0.20972739350279296,0.060476733451452575,0.12778409310786254,0.3827096427813315,0.0,0.043414274965733544,0.060023403924820244,0.10808108045983846,0.0,0.05269225353030341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23175165313486853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459069087658876,0.05446898066898796,0.0,0.0,0.10887068511543956,0.3836085670200564,0.06135344840685786,0.0,0.0,0.15515984237910646,0.0,0.05707396904862235,0.05519029651996846,0.23539886270635418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0538214957392247,0.1970020170100153,0.12507312638489987,0.06618929227300496,0.0,0.0,0.06254415285477538,0.0,0.0,0.06067879122305994,0.10301559586345191,0.0,0.07742078055742518,0.0,0.16989635591533767,

1085810,B000SAGGPA,A372YWV7XH98XK,3,32,1226102400,Sorry Lee... this comes up short!!!,"I watched Lee Strobel's DVD - ""The Case For The Creator"". !!Awesome!! Bravo!! Have you seen it? If not watch it!!! * I'm an absolute believer in GOD!!However, Lee, dropped the ball on this one! Everything verified here was mostly substantiated by the bible itself (99%). I'm sorry I'm not convinced!!!A man (GOD's Son) that travels with multitudes of people, disciples, performs miracles, rose from the dead [yet] amazingly is not found in any documentation other than the bible. WOW!!! Yes, you may find a weak statement or two, regarding a Christ and or Savior yet you have to try really hard to accept that Jesus himself was whom they were referring to!!If others find what I'm about to say offensive... I apologize!! I hear what you're preaching so why not hear my thoughts and belief's?I myself (as Lee has done) am personally searching for truth... there are many things I have found to be overwhelming constants and not so easily cleansed of its so called misinterpretation by religion!![EXAMPLE] There are lists of Jesus attributes ~VERBATIM~ to that of many mythological characters adding to Joesph in the Old Testament.How long was the Egyptian and or the Roman Empire? Why? All believed in something other than what we believe today!!! So why when all their god's and deity's are dismissed as myth are the ones found in the Bible still so absolute?** The Roman Empire along with ""Men Of Faith"" made our current Bible (300 AD). This story of Jesus is MANipulated and tainted - I'm not buying into it anymore!!!FYI:God is not a man nor anything closely resembling that which we call Human. God is ""Absolute Energy""... found in everything (a rock, a germ, a cell, an atom, mountains, planets, the sun, sky, space, etc...).GOD is 100% guarenteed in every sub-atomic particle of my being!!! So who are we that we should be given GODS ONLY SON? Doesn't that sound a bit vain to you? It's as obscure as money, racism, government, institutions and or any factions we divide ourselves into.So why do we need a savior when we are a part of the whole!?!CONTROL... BY FEAR......I rest my case!!!",0.09375,360,0.046389550690602945,0.0,0.07870797171249354,0.0,0.08535416946352388,0.16443953870028796,0.22755936956399297,0.1428878372087174,0.0,0.0803221001960738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326791431555139,0.0,0.055065944316927726,0.0,0.0545353031963858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06404981704278741,0.04291289321252229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04547998514716588,0.11286820830026388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056395711497802155,0.08775437141840774,0.2014309175448412,0.11028192187538198,0.132337430769098,0.10297287567791438,0.05932046892919757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11597001629699186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13703711295232748,0.0,0.2597618436599442,0.2051813189413865,0.0354164982899001,0.0378228569500525,0.05229286040353286,0.18832217045965416,0.1078434521828021,0.0,0.05964306294658523,0.0,0.05105786784801894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296602235082249,0.0,0.04959222979682147,0.10511057551699549,0.18969799000101323,0.3119226069203065,0.05345160559094003,0.0,0.0,0.09011764797530546,0.04448532138363916,0.04972328960005915,0.0,0.20508133597474315,0.0,0.058592808901813585,0.0,0.0,0.10297782166058642,0.054482344474089894,0.0,0.39274764266316925,0.0,0.05448895664745133,0.13908931910001926,0.09574425618047766,0.05286383895949785,0.04487399765449391,0.0,0.06744959141425617,0.0,0.18501879771091917,

Its about God telling this guy to build an ark in modern day times.  Its about his willingness to be faithful and to do what he is called to do even when he doesnt understand and about his family supporting him.  It teaches us how to listen and follow God, how His plans are not ours, and combines it with funny humorous moments throughout the movie.  I laughed out loud.  One scene shows him sitting on the couch with a fish tank behind him and the fish follow him no matter where he sits(because he's the modern Noah), as he trys to shoo them away!  So funny, you have to see it.This is the kind of comedy we need, not more sexual, nasty mouthed comedy.

Hilary Duff may be charming and I enjoyed the Lizzie Mcguire movie, but she cannot carry a movie. She needs to stop thinking she can, and take smaller, meatier roles to improve her acting skills. She's never going to be taken seriosuly until she does. Chad Michael Murray is gorgeous and likeable, but he's wasted in this film. The usually reliable Jennifer Coolidge who was hysterical in the Legally Blond movies, tries so hard to make  something funny out out of this script, that all the jokes seem forced. She has a few moments, but most of all they fall flat. The stepsisters are annoying, and not in the way they are suppose to be. The script is corny and unbelievable, with so many things that just annoyed me. Are we really suppose to believe no one recognizes Hilary Duff as Cinderella at the dance? She has a mask on that ONLY covers her eyes, and when she loses her cell phone (replacing the glass slipper) she makes no fuss about it at all. Not even a mention. They guy is trying so hard to find out who she is, and all he has is her cell phone. All he needs to do is call people in the phone. This movie was just annoying.

142931,0792839137,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,1,1,1206748800,"Not the best swordfight movie, but one of the better ones","Few authors' resume has spawned as many big screen adaptations as Alexander Dumas, the French writer of long-winded adventure tales.  The most famous adaptations have been of the 3, sometimes 4, musketeers.  This one from the late 1990's is probably the most balanced and well written one.  The movie stars a cast from numerous countries, including veterans such as Jeremy Irons, Gerard Depardieu and John Malkovich.  The key to the movie is Leo DiCaprio, who plays identical twins; one good and one bad, and Leo does a good job of portraying both.The movie itself is best described as a drama.  There is action, but it does not dominate the movie.  There is some comedy, but only in a couple of scenes.  The only substantial romance is a sideplot between the King's mother and one of the musketeers.  As a story, it is quite believable and is not made to be a glorification of the musketeers.

1044953,B000MCIC24,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,25,26,1183680000,A wonderful and surprisingly moving look at the story of Jesus' birth,"When you're talking about film adaptations of the story of Christ's birth, the old rubric ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all"" just does not apply.  That is especially the case with The Nativity Story, a truly wonderful film that conveys great spiritual power, even as it brings home the humanity of Mary and Joseph to a degree few of its predecessors ever even attempted.  Keisha Castle-Hughes is wonderful as young Mary, but I tend to look upon this film as Joseph's story, and Oscar Isaac is more than up to the task of bringing this humble carpenter to vivid life.The Nativity Story basically tells the story of Mary and Joseph from the time Mary is betrothed and then finds out she is to give birth to God's Son up through the time of Jesus' birth and the family's evacuation to Egypt.  It does an exceptional job of humanizing Mary and Joseph.  At 14, Mary is on the brink of womanhood, and early on we are treated with several moments showing us a glimpse of the normal child she was.  Her sudden betrothal to Joseph is not something she welcomes, but we see it as a reality of family survival in those troubled times under the double domination of Herod and Rome.  When the angel appears to her, she accepts the good news he brings - yet she doesn't completely believe it until she finds her much older cousin Elizabeth carrying the child who would be Jesus' messenger.  Her most trying time comes when she returns home.  A lot of adaptations tend to gloss over this part.  Put yourself in her place, though - she's a 14-year-old girl, betrothed to a good man, who returns home with a child she claims to have been miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit.  Her story was even less plausible back then than it would be today.  Suddenly, she is a pariah of sorts, looked down upon by all who know her, her very future very much in doubt.The thing I loved most about this film is the depth of its portrayal of Joseph.  All too often, Joseph gets short shrift in the story of Christ's birth, but this film has one of the best characterizations of Joseph I've ever seen.  Obviously mortified by Mary's pregnancy, he refuses to accuse her (thus very probably saving her life).  Even after he is visited by an angel and told that Mary is indeed carrying the Son of God, it takes a lot of courage for him to take Mary as his wife and to claim a child that is not his.  On the long and hard road to Bethlehem, we see many small yet all-encompassing examples of his sacrifice for Mary and the Child.  After their arrival and frantic effort to find a room, it is Joseph who delivers the child himself.  The bond that grows between he and Mary is one of this film's many great strengths.The portrayal of the three Wise Men from the East is especially interesting, as they sometimes serve up a few bits of comic relief.  One of them, for example, is less than enthused about actually traveling to Judea to find the child whose birth they have predicted based upon their study of the stars (with the star of Bethlehem being attributed to the rare convergence of three heavenly bodies).  It really was a hard journey, requiring several months of travel across deserts and mountains.  By conveying their journey basically in its entirety, this film produced in me a new level of respect for these men and their significance in the story of Jesus' birth.The final half hour of the film pretty much blew me away.  The light of the Star shining down on the manger, the depiction of the shepherds, the arrival of the Magi - it all really brings home the significance of this newborn baby.  As if that isn't enough, the story also features some subtle and profound foreshadowing of later events in Jesus' life.  For Christians, the film is truly a blessing, but even nonbelievers should appreciate the poignancy of the story, the fine acting, and the excellent cinematography - and everyone should welcome the opportunity to glance into the rearview mirror of time and get a sense of life as it was just over two thousand years ago.",0.9615384615384616,724,0.05964381344898485,0.05006315550998549,0.08433011874228835,0.02314247568230095,0.036580422996039794,0.201354893071269,0.01625426941195564,0.12247550550691895,0.018134652126080057,0.03442381806969978,0.0,0.023380840871009678,0.023902581898564305,0.05656506998721138,0.09477098404382271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148873657705692,0.16930090510104553,0.0,0.06862492526640397,0.03678254490822016,0.02248778855696504,0.03683982390203746,0.0380412179013691,0.0,0.019491456656348907,0.03224811651170099,0.08022009289394322,0.2421652989197197,0.02600160972898181,0.05844729325260336,0.0,0.03760908279482203,0.09866021562469411,0.023631882170335485,0.19283488280627198,0.11032827608458147,0.07626930914069123,0.03879610446384839,0.0,0.0,0.04970152340143746,0.045296271315465174,0.01995149306657521,0.047756876481780314,0.0,0.0,0.0674787434305777,0.0,0.0,0.04771144336777337,0.4506669077831645,0.06071410437830899,0.06483929794398131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019673993914949492,0.0,0.0,0.043763964078043144,0.04326518898012897,0.0,0.2574673885444352,0.0,0.0,0.020337380211284357,0.21253850335451932,0.06757120369050107,0.08129928226530367,0.5060794097859066,0.09163148582540716,0.04825839260313054,0.049513509528076975,0.0,0.03813034286564567,0.08524007568731869,0.08242680736922094,0.23071691075509715,0.024496949783897097,0.025111248198255012,0.06238162135402593,0.06028687570126532,0.058844573525918056,0.0,0.0,0.0721374496220509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06154998776046565,0.0,0.07692698908756575,0.0,0.057814037682083264,0.043214251110801724,0.04757634635793494,

The film has lavish production design and slick cinematography. This lasts for about 90 minutes where the film bogs down in tedious emotional scenes between Redford and Lena Olin. The film runs for 145 minutes where Pollack fails to pump up the excitement and interests as it wants to take itself extremely seriously. The template to this film was inspired by CASABLANCA but also fails to have the wit and fun of that film. There's one brief scene in the back of a car where Redford mimicks Bogart. Pollack after HAVANA  would go on to direct his second best film in THE FIRM which moves at an entertaining pace and great performances. HAVANA needed  that pace and excitement as THE FIRM. Still HAVANA is an interesting film with grand production design.

622201,B00005JMUA,A36EW68H08UOCS,28,34,1095984000,The End to Tarantino's Spaghetti Kung-Fu Western,"In a telling moment of ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" Bill's brother, Budd, played in a wonderful understated performance by Michael Madsen, is listening to a recounting of events we saw in Volume 1 - specifically when Uma Thuman's Bride single-handedly destroy Lucy Liu's O-Ren Shii and her bodyguard platoon, the ""Crazy 88"".Budd asks ""You're telling me she cut through eighty-eight bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?""Brother Bill replies ""Nah, there weren't really eighty-eight of them. They just called themselves ""The Crazy 88.""Budd asks ""How come?""Bill answers ""I don't know. I guess they thought it sounded cool.""There is a LOT in Quentin Tarantino movies that happens because it looks or sounds cool.  I'm reminded in ""Pulp Fiction"" of the dialogue-less scene in the Pawn shop where Bruce Willis is upstairs selecting a weapon to use on the psychotic murdering rapists downstairs.  He considers a few lethal clubs and even a chain-saw before settling on the Samurai sword and in the audience I was thinking ""YEAH! Get the samurai sword! That'll get 'em!"" Plus - it's cool.There is a scene where one of the characters sicks a deadly Black Mamba on another character, then whips out a notebook with pages of hand-written notes about how god-awful deadly the Black Mamba is. The character sits down, flips open the notebook, and delivers an almost pharmacologic description of the lethal venom, along with ""'In the bush,' the saying goes, 'a lion can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and the black mamba can kill you. However, only with the mamba is death certain.' Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.'"" Pretty cool, huh?""Tarantino's movies are cool, and the characters in them know it. The smallest touches are added, sometimes for no apparent reason other than to add a ""cool"" factor.  All of the members of Bill's Assassination team are called the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" and they all have ""Snake"" Code-names.  Why?  'Cuz it's cool, of course.In the beginning, at the wedding rehearsal of the bride, we get to see Samuel Jackson portraying the piano player for the wedding, and is there anyone cooler than Mr. Jackson in the movies?  He asserts his coolness by telling how he sat in with practically every R&B; group that came through his little town over 2 decades.The Bride is standing at the alter of her wedding rehearsal when she hears a flute playing a familiar refrain.  She follows the notes outside where she finds her old boss and lover, Bill, playing the familiar notes on his old flute.  Bill is played by David Carradine, and if movies gave out ""comeback of the year"" awards like sports does, Mr. Carradine would have earned it in this role, courtesy of Mr. Tarantino.  For extra ""coolness"", the flute that Bill is playing for the Bride is the same one that Carradine played back 30 years ago in his iconic role as Caine in the wildly popular tv series ""Kung Fu"".The ""Wedding Chapel Massacre"" that we're told about in a roundabout way in Volume 1 is set up perfectly in Volume 2, then executed with a single swooping crane shot that backs from the wedding party at the altar, all the way back through the church, down the steps, straight back through the gravel parking lot where the other members of the Assassination Squad are approaching with cool strides and lethal weapons.  The crane swoops the camera up overhead and we see the flashes in the church and hear the shots and screams - and we KNOW what is happening in there without being shown in gory detail.  I can think of no single camera shot as virtuoso since Orson Welles' virtuoso opening to ""Touch of Evil"".I haven't told you ANYTHING about the plot, but if you watched Volume 1 you KNOW where the plot is going.  There's a surprise or two, but there's delight in every scene.  I've read Roger Ebert say that movies aren't as important in ""what they're about"" as in ""how they're about it"".Kill Bill is about Kung-Fu movies and westerns, and the way it's about it is..... cool.",0.8235294117647058,681,0.1684766773167862,0.0,0.06125359215778857,0.0,0.022141973557576203,0.20719473423103915,0.07870911794676722,0.07413389956366999,0.06586096413838269,0.0,0.02960104187602346,0.0,0.0,0.03423859489199656,0.06883736548210961,0.09753621162433065,0.0,0.02947696034189753,0.0,0.026993462131632787,0.0,0.0,0.06646139792550175,0.022264317086391847,0.08167057329827872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03903929395026523,0.07283531860072912,0.08794897170801108,0.0,0.0943410575542843,0.11703820545321283,0.045529233866858025,0.3583116388429803,0.0,0.21971224407171652,0.12020622040286486,0.0307769910411846,0.023483116071908002,0.022337647261179646,0.0,0.0,0.027417639261098945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17515099181410831,0.0,0.0,0.05467158708516197,0.0,0.22621340363359455,0.07349997532078713,0.039246949679145736,0.027130886272635178,0.048853202425043755,0.05595196770345925,0.047634337425118044,0.0,0.0,0.026490140245115604,0.05237646762396726,0.03256029563508523,0.15584390890466893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05453408072147024,0.13122695407235796,0.6126554037238134,0.0,0.05842119721061331,0.05994063102179909,0.16364376969012986,0.11540066712238989,0.012898863294437117,0.0,0.07980111950323156,0.0,0.030399462229493062,0.05034577140343102,0.0,0.017809184316414033,0.0,0.08975369824282184,0.14554829890069496,0.0,0.0,0.048108753522892574,0.049674592394549785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049837690847906,0.026157401337579354,0.13438954167666298,

1646228,B00CEKM52U,A30EH53Y32NUTT,8,9,1376697600,Sex is a supporting character in this movie,"So glad I bought this disc, especially if the Amazon Thought Police have censored it as too blatantly sexual, making it unavailable now.  No movie in my experience has so completely and realistically integrated frank sexuality into a plot; every other film I have ever seen suddenly seems dishonest and coy.  Not only is sexuality a character, but this must be the first time that the erect male organ has had more than a cameo or a walk-on role in a legit picture.  I mean, violence is a character in mainstream cinema, but until, now sex has just been an understudy.  That is sex, has been understudied.The sexuality is between the characters however, and is not aimed to titillate the audience; nobody's body is idealized or shaven, porn-style. These are just people trying to love each other and understand themselves, or vice versa.Every actor plays a character with his/her own name.  What does that mean?  The actors appear in an audition reel -- they do not seem to be the same people they are playing. Main character is Jesse Metzger, who seems like a nice Jewish boy -- although the hostile voice of his father on the phone ain't no jewish Dad.  Jesse is leaving behind the welcoming gay SF scene he has lived in for 10 years, and returning home back east .  Like American Graffiti, the film takes place on the last night of youth.  Jesse is leaving (we think) because he realizes he has been avoiding himself; sex is comfort food that he has outgrown.  But, what awaits him at home?  I hope there will be a sequel, but i bet there won't be.It must be noted that a porn house produced this movie -- so this is less a regular filmmaker going into the netherworld than a porn studio taking what it has learned about sex and turning that into a work of art.  PLUS, it must be noted that the ubiquitous James Franco has entered a project with the director, Travis Matthews.  I've always been a Franco fan, but my respect for him went up when i read about this.",0.8888888888888888,355,0.09314300045843758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568894640189963,0.14150100431051968,0.07615063503196173,0.03586206831200431,0.042480078325420105,0.24191142091297752,0.05727768764964192,0.21907670345355926,0.0,0.1656282532216274,0.0,0.0,0.05528192448946129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812981246260324,0.05297957839282908,0.0643010338466985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052713261454417785,0.4109253046121098,0.07554060070963411,0.18791404465412245,0.05672676152973506,0.12181655431764928,0.09127444989542881,0.0,0.04404928122590325,0.14444355129483324,0.16607170602339213,0.2922842689877704,0.12922094609252016,0.0,0.09087913817631642,0.08644619929341522,0.053673864933781096,0.0,0.0,0.04673599373645076,0.0,0.06880024982955986,0.0,0.0,0.09171640081672669,0.10578891450812601,0.11176315030422164,0.0772447811510534,0.1066662276528791,0.0,0.05249796395986571,0.14179560710595615,0.1082664368005724,0.0,0.11975399107501475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12761381622876564,0.0,0.0,0.10552284121981544,0.22218236281325915,0.3578811802825175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047110827457869,0.08931960427177378,0.12479578690313506,0.048270807854692704,0.07720714048075727,0.05738363980289774,0.0,0.04870925457630184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05632686874527442,0.0,0.0,0.13963485655532742,0.048059892608086206,0.0,0.04505000287652201,0.04972447513990494,0.06771414284566586,0.0,0.0,

In his dedication to exactness he has put us 'in the car', so that people who don't quite understand racing can appreciate the experience. Even while the film was being made in full Cinerama, the crew realized that nothing this complicated and expensive could ever be made again! The crew goes to several of the European Gran Prix race courses, so that we get the flavor of what it's like to follow a circuit. The director put the cameras 'on the cars' so that you feel you are actually there. James Garner was trained for several months in driving technique and did all his own driving, and for my money did a better job than McQueen (who was offered the part) would have done. The main actors all went through drivers training and did some of their own driving. In addition, actual professional drivers are in the film and do their driving. There are three love interests thrown in for the female viewers. Frankenheimer and his Director of Photography created firsts in cinematography effects in: split-screen, multiple-screen and quick cross-editing; so that the film is anything but boring. Frankenheimer was able to convince Ferrari of the professionalism of the film and got Ferrari's full support, utilizing their cars and even visiting their factory! Music was first-rate in creating not only a theme for the film, but in effecting different effects with the multiple-screen 'dances of cars.'All in all a terrifically enjoyable three hours.

But there's a demented serial killer who's completely fixated on her and always one step ahead who keeps making trouble for her.Profiler is a very atmospheric show and is a cut above the rest as it skips the usual light hearted approach and completely discards humorous aspects.  It's very serious in tone and that's it's biggest appeal.There are some standout episodes on season 1 and they all concern Jack of All Trades, the serial killer who's obsessed with Sam.  He's a genuinely frightening character and that makes viewers want to continue with the series.Actors are good, especially Ally Walker and Robert Davi deliver first rate performances every show.  Others aren't as noticable but very capable and do their jobs well.But one thing; what's with the price tag on this series?

What sets Riki-Oh apart is its incredible originality with how far it's willing to take things over the top.Take a film like Cabin Fever, which thinks that the very idea of sleaze is enough to drive a feature film. We watch, bored and annoyed, as characters we don't care about rot and vomit blood on each other. The misconception that blood is enough to drive a story made Cabin Fever the most unbearable filmgoing experience I've ever had.Now take a film like Riki-Oh, which puts forth the effort to come up with new and inspired ways to torture its characters. My personal favorite was the guy who tore out his own intestines to strangle our hero. The assistant warden gleefully comments, ""Oscar, you got a lot of guts.""Like many Chinese films, it exists to expose the evils of capitalism. It shows a dark vision of the future in which prisons are a privatize enterprise (""like parking lots""). The cells aren't locked, and murder seems encouraged. At one point, you have to wonder if this is how our prison systems are actually perceived.This might not be the smartest propaganda film in history, but that's exactly what makes it so entertaining. It pushes on relentlessly, so involved in the filmmaking and violence that it never bothers to try to make it about anything else.

651788,B00005JPK3,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,11,15,1171584000,Alpha Dog,"Interesting movie based on the real life case of Jesse James Hollywood one of the biggest young lowlifes you'll ever see. Having seen various news segments on Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted, I felt I had a decent background on what to expect here. For the most part, it's not a bad movie but it does have a couple of flaws. In the end though Cassavetes does a good job of showing his own interpretation of what happened.For instance, he uses Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone to play the parents of Hollywood perhaps hinting that bad parenting was a factor in his pathetic behavior. With this I disagree because Hollywood (looking at home videos shown on UM and AMW) really looked like an evil punk. My opinion on this is that it really wouldn't have mattered if he had great parents or not, this idiot would have turned out to be trash either way.Now, I have to agree with the other reviewers that Justin Timberlake in was great. In fact he's perfect for this role Frankie Ballenbacher. He is brash, arrogant, a loudmouth but can also be serious in his songs and interviews. He plays this role as best as anyone could playing a real punk who thought. He may not have had the lead role in the movie but in my mind he's the one that stood out. Cassavetes changed the names too but he didn't need to do it. Jesse James is called Johnny TrueLove here, and the victim Zach in real life is called Nick Markowitz.The stories is still the same too, Nick's brother, Ben had a drug deal with Jessie and had a falling out and thus Jessie wanted to collect the money in one form in another. Another thing that the movie shows in consensus with real life case is that Nick Markowitz perhaps didn't take the whole kidnapping thing as seriously as a victim would. He is seen hanging out with Jessie's friends and blonde bimbos. Hell he even tries to pick up the bimbos himself. In all, Nick acts more as a guest than a kidnapping victim. I guess his expectation was that it was all a game and that it would never go as far as it did.Cassavetes presents Hollywood's hoodlums as the news reports did as accessories to a crime who were too afraid to stand up to Hollywood. It's clear by watching the movie and a couple of the reports that Hollywood wasn't well liked which makes him getting away with the crime at the time equally disturbing. However, for my money I don't feel sorry for these losers since all of them participated in the crime and they all deserve to be in jail.Summing up then, ""Alpha Dog"" is a decent recollection of the events about the real life kidnapping/murder case of Nick Markowitz. Cassavetes does add some things like the parents interview that adds unnecessary details for the movie and scenes could have been taken out , but I have to say it was a decent movie.",0.7333333333333333,510,0.0324643274181247,0.0,0.11016279856353471,0.03778958106655038,0.02986627012672544,0.19727665681029932,0.0,0.2249904189595897,0.05922451133059212,0.08431649760098806,0.03992745770393758,0.03817880997817633,0.039030766144283476,0.11545708890231247,0.030950498412058505,0.032890505852322456,0.03853623971949985,0.03976008993943786,0.0,0.03641021562881541,0.0,0.0,0.13446999597492812,0.0,0.0,0.030078059299597556,0.06211788693175651,0.18372830708809415,0.0,0.18430395713154865,0.32748048925252915,0.0,0.04245828977863568,0.12725222987149298,0.0,0.030706124587190787,0.2819307004253293,0.0,0.14817977301191465,0.1621405354915279,0.0,0.0,0.060260410424853694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03257899349181034,0.07798268344616603,0.16785884909715665,0.0,0.0,0.09590128891289491,0.0,0.07790849525781311,0.17948744434447514,0.12392583883332135,0.0794075558160642,0.0,0.03294789726823414,0.03773549311690755,0.16062931169468614,0.0,0.0,0.07146261666316152,0.03532408089715767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03320911248762195,0.0,0.036779232476835524,0.22125735811450528,0.42098713459397996,0.0,0.039400807079860746,0.04042555359865123,0.0,0.031131709990705133,0.08699336002674131,0.03364889048493546,0.2152799781194851,0.12000394630853325,0.0,0.1018635762907467,0.0,0.12010986919200531,0.0,0.0403548519831544,0.0,0.03424243214959567,0.03813245230748042,0.06489164231176364,0.0,0.036995162725466976,0.06280742670399489,0.0,0.1416076845297864,0.10584747725353601,0.025895964664351834,

1047244,B000MMMT9G,A1NZRSRYA1WGPO,2,3,1237420800,"Sidesplitting. Recommended, with caveats.","Sidesplitting. Recommended, with caveats.I finally viewed this film.  I have to say that it made me laugh harder than any film I have ever seen.  I love how Sasha Cohen is able to comically highlight certain reactionary political/social attitudes that are prevalent in our society.  The best material is when he is making this social critique.  The parts that I found unfunny are when he is abusive to those of good will ... the scene at the etiquette dinner party comes to mind.  He insults one of the women at the dinner table by saying that the two women on either side of him would both be considered attractive in his nation, but not her.  Why be mean about something so personal as a woman's appearance? It seemed just like cruelty for cruelty's sake.The bag of ""poop"" that he brings to the dinner table in the same vignette is likewise not funny and in doing so, he is basically expressing contempt for all social protocols. That is boringly base, something from a Tom Green show, not really creative.I think that Cohen should have decided what type of film he wanted to make and been consistent with his larger vision of a good-willed but incisive social critique. Michael Moore has shown that you can be very funny but still have heart.That being said, parts of the this film are uniquely brilliant.  I enjoyed the intro segment from Borat's ""hometown."" It was filmed in rural Romania and the authentic setting as a backdrop to the film's absurdist humor made it absolutely sidesplittingly funny.  Also very illuminating was the rodeo audience response to his comments regarding the Iraq war; the cheering from the crowd showed a bloodthirstiness that thoughtful people should abhor. The naked fight scene between him and his producer served as a humorous foil to people's homophobia.Cohen has talent in spades, no doubt. This could have been great, but it needed a bit more tweaking so that only those deserving of volleys would have received them.",0.6666666666666666,335,0.046945853290520936,0.0,0.03982591809794879,0.054646569627377184,0.0,0.09509228256376569,0.11514412857418212,0.10845100905384138,0.08564308708199254,0.12192798191582546,0.0,0.11041884767595637,0.05644141637763238,0.13356769076774405,0.04475674296304063,0.047562139283135144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22209555339784554,0.0,0.06481790121723474,0.13028251140843364,0.0,0.08699026109218942,0.04491356264764812,0.0,0.09205076050915162,0.2284434433680123,0.28413681526710005,0.05718274505467828,0.12279574544959998,0.18401627230704665,0.05707200778572476,0.0,0.17472554848713295,0.0,0.1874941861720738,0.13025965552889224,0.0,0.04580482341126739,0.04357053744862667,0.054105308532354984,0.0,0.05347927936236745,0.04711166903662633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05331963578388307,0.11266152972621216,0.20764184937296962,0.03584121225641527,0.0382764279233515,0.052919955380021325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071660282128517,0.0,0.05167015281752772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062008755730404284,0.1286396071638774,0.0,0.0,0.05318552975878107,0.3519502151910286,0.4284000256909965,0.0,0.0569765233351663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006391406657585,0.0,0.23348325083907678,0.0,0.059295452739559995,0.0,0.0949040196578391,0.06947515314527662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04691909184676697,0.09689241945965343,0.0,0.0,0.05012417258144424,0.06825844561759636,0.10204226266196056,0.03744750791511703,

Well, I wish I could have read the original script for this one. Sure it plays like a TV episode but it is still entertaining. No blockbuster but it is a good Trek movie. I love the scenes with the &quot;Riker Maneuver&quot; where he drops the &quot;warp core&quot; on the enemy ships. It was more balanced than Generations. This movie had a message about not fighting the aging process and it comes off quite well. You have to remember that Trek is not supposed to be cutting edge Matrix type movie entertainment. I believe Rick Berman the producer and Jonathan Frakes can't be faulted. They turned out a film you can take your family to.

297966,6302148332,A37WR02ICSDPJO,41,41,1125187200,Give That Girl A Contract,"How hard can it be to find a film with elements of homelessness, unemployment, despair, suicidal thoughts, thievery, feigned affection, disability and self-pity? Not very hard you say. But in a G-rated film barely eighty minutes long?Still unavailable on DVD format, ""Lili"" (1953), is available only as a rare ""Video Compact Disc"" (VCD) which compresses movies onto (at least two) CD-sized disks; i.e., a CD which contains moving pictures and sound. By using an MPEG compression standard, VCDs can hold up to 700 Mb (eighty minutes) of full-motion video and quality stereo sound and can be played on almost all standalone DVD players and PCs. VCD quality is similar to that of VHS tapes.VCD not withstanding, and barely a decade after ""The Wizard of Oz,"" MGM still made the industry's best-looking films. The sets, costumes and color of ""Lili"" are outstanding. And at least two things in the film suggest that 1939 classic -- a puppet named ""Golo"" who resembles Burt Lahr's ""Cowardly Lion,"" and a surreal, yellowish road on which Lili eventually seeks something better.We first meet Lili (Leslie Caron), an orphaned teenager, at a bakery where a friend of her late father had promised her a job. But he too has died. Homeless and unemployed, she falls in with some traveling circus performers whose act causes her inattentiveness which immediately costs her the job she does get.Deflated, she climbs a trapeze ladder but is thwarted by the high-pitched voice of ""Carrot Top,"" one of four puppets manned by Paul Berthalet (Mel Ferrer). Paul is overtly bitter that his limp has reduced him from a once-famous dancer to a puppeteer on a French midway. He is particularly aloof towards Lili, except during his puppets' ""conversations"" with her, planned spontaneities which have become growing nightly attractions at the circus. Through these improvisations with her savior Carrot Top plus a foxy kleptomaniac named Reynardo, a cowardly giant called Golo and the pulchritudinous ballerina, ""Margurite,"" she and Paul can communicate their true feelings as well as introduce the hit song, `Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo"" (Best Score Oscar).Sparring regularly with Paul, ""the angry man,"" she is genuinely hurt when she learns that Marc (Jean-Paul Aumont), a vain womanizing magician, is married to Rosalie, his assistant (Gabor). Marc delights in flaunting Lili's childlike advances, warning her ""never come on to a man like that."" Marc is either a true heel or is perhaps too absorbed in himself to realize that Lili genuinely loves him.Although not a musical, the film does contain two wistful ballet dream sequences which showcase Caron's considerable dancing talent. It is thru these musings that she begins to mature as a woman.When Lili learns that Marc and Rosalie are married and plan to leave the show, she tries to escape until she is joined in her second dream sequence by human versions of the puppets she adores, each of whom becomes Paul as they dance divinely. After all, Marc had recently declared to her, ""I am the puppets.""Predictably, it is indeed Paul, the talented but crippled war hero, who is the better choice for Lili who learns for herself, as did Dorothy Gale, that growth can be a painful but ultimately fulfilling journey.",1.0,530,0.0,0.0851659337639152,0.05738394421163737,0.0,0.062229514903736606,0.23977721975693791,0.05530254807223789,0.156263733529898,0.1234004981162903,0.08784114524224389,0.0,0.0,0.08132470620449214,0.12028349378918994,0.12897723713332282,0.17132707025717783,0.0,0.0,0.07952055498564918,0.0,0.12800426912434298,0.03847513129321369,0.046697063181536436,0.03128667930946631,0.03825554924034732,0.0,0.0,0.07656345017750237,0.06631655914001398,0.027429762735378786,0.06823400411284494,0.3707678878380272,0.08846631217610516,0.09942877661474017,0.04111665301434496,0.0,0.12587834261691236,0.0,0.2508578649119958,0.05630614305623784,0.0,0.0,0.03138972570668526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04102149110285179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08116527183010072,0.18699048367062923,0.12910625936740908,0.027575665665413602,0.038125370515512215,0.03432520457694593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.437995774252983,0.04467325738373671,0.0,0.034597339268003825,0.0,0.0,0.20745583906750542,0.2599025099188762,0.038970181628579195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0324330959745759,0.0,0.0,0.2055893014234885,0.08334694772874263,0.12815549952830615,0.03537391239926225,0.034186072974586784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04090601956551964,0.03567385436400133,0.0,0.0,0.06980465810139964,0.2312499371788501,0.0981494093393038,0.0,0.12293937661587054,0.0,0.02697848295400127,

621577,B00005JMQY,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,3,3,1137196800,Shrek 2,"Shrek was a great movie that still vividly lives in our hearts, minds, and on DVD (calling to us if Shrek 2 is a bomb). It was the film that made DreamWorks a major player in the animated film game, won the first Animated Feature Oscar, set fairy tales on their ears, and found a way to satisfy kids, parents, and those who think they are cooler than cool. Can Shrek 2 top the first one? You bet it can, thanks to the power of Banderas and Puss-In-Boots.Mike Myers is back as the voice of Shrek - the not-so-jolly green Ogre enjoying a wonderful honeymoon with his new wife, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), after saving her in the original Shrek and having a fairy tale wedding. However, the happily-ever-after part of that fairy tale is being challenged.Princess Fiona has been asked to come home by her mother and father, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) of the land Far Far Away, so they can meet their new son-in-law. Mom and Dad think Fiona has married Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), but instead, they are shocked to learn she has married someone better described as Prince Surly.Will Mom and Dad be able to accept Fiona's choice to marry an ogre and continue to live like one, even though she is a beautiful princess? Will Fiona want to stay with Shrek after his horrible behavior on the trip?Shrek 2 is one of the few movies that made me laugh until I cry. It is an amazing film, and one of the funniest I have ever seen. Shrek 2 parodies Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, From Here to Eternity, Little Red Riding Hood and more all in the first three minutes! While the parodies and hilarious takes on our favorite movies and fairy tales are very funny, Shrek 2 succeeds because of great characters and a hilarious plot. It's as if writers J. David Stem, Joe Stillman and David Weiss, along with directors Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon, want to give us what we expect up front, then deliver what we didn't realize we need in the rest of the movie.With a sequel, new characters are extremely important. We know what to expect from Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey (Eddie Murphy). However, the writing team makes Shrek 2 an amazing movie by adding Prince Charming, The Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and, the character who steals the movie, Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas).Banderas is awesome as Puss-In-Boots, a feline assassin that is part cat, a dash of Indiana Jones and whole lotta Zorro (I guess he would have been a whole lotta Hannibal Lecter if Anthony Hopkins played the role, that would have been creepy, eeew). Banderas knows exactly how to make the most out of his delicious dialogue by emphasizing the campy aspects, and the animation team obviously put the most work into this character to give him the best facial expressions and a dramatic flair that is rivaled by no animated character I can remember (he makes Jar Jar Binks look like a statue). As the movie goes on, Puss-In-Boots, with amazing dialogue and characterization, becomes a memorable part of the Shrek team and a character you will want to see again and again. Just thinking about his scenes as I write this review makes me break into laughter. Also, the writers have come up with a compelling story that doesn't feel like the last movie all over again.Stem, Stillman and Weiss have created a great conflict for Shrek and the gang. Fiona's Dad is trying to get rid of Shrek, so our hero has to spend the movie getting back to Far Far Away, while facing peril and new challenges along the way, as well as his own fragile ego and self-image. It's an exceptional plot that never loses sight of Shrek's core theme of staying true to yourself and taking pride in yourself, no matter how you look (it also reinforces the important role friends play in our lives). Adamson, Asbury and Vernon amazingly keep this whole complex mixture of story, fairy tale gone askew, parodies and new characters together in a compelling way that always feels in control, builds to a great climax, touches our heart when it needs to, and constantly makes us laugh. They even lay off the gross out humor, most of the time.Shrek 2 is one of the great movies of all time.",1.0,738,0.02495295659911366,0.09425129841433261,0.06350557096074527,0.05809218001700335,0.09182407910702793,0.4169884201823235,0.08160284644450072,0.15371884173616687,0.0,0.021602643809916125,0.030689319583533586,0.0880357855058504,0.030000098295112607,0.017748685757961905,0.09515754737809311,0.10112211529725935,0.0,0.0,0.029334559906711438,0.05597174514959858,0.07082977919898502,0.08515919266733354,0.017226210224683163,0.046165722492819,0.02822439308069817,0.0,0.11936370317126892,0.0,0.09785480381774429,0.10118641882379477,0.05034206518514037,0.06078826799621411,0.03263458529337635,0.1222618648550467,0.060670548450293765,0.07080466361887824,0.21669953118275115,0.05932068686280011,0.15660557728994245,0.09693100933278674,0.0,0.024346469187347848,0.06947666218105544,0.0,0.0,0.05685128902111056,0.025041092032299043,0.08990938686881034,0.12902083330887226,0.0907951954135431,0.0,0.0,0.056681579493813396,0.01996085606859166,0.2621218812620402,0.0952527381235748,0.10172464422255406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049385606442907605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027151040161030742,0.0,0.06462939440515374,0.0,0.06837533689339496,0.0,0.05335135776704258,0.02826950886500769,0.17006436582399156,0.47938081848748665,0.05750327712201137,0.0,0.031072169506247443,0.0,0.09571468378187416,0.04011926400076464,0.05172688736561693,0.2895724834400996,0.0,0.0,0.052196725870345725,0.025221992120885047,0.036927872424057186,0.0,0.09305347901990899,0.1207194876048236,0.02631965579548459,0.0,0.0748161965622595,0.02575043553471876,0.0,0.04827548011272884,0.07992695085875488,0.10884348105114239,0.05423814827098659,0.05971300813097937,

350218,6303002889,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,0,0,1398124800,Fall Brawl 2000; One Of WCW's Last Best PPVs,"1.) WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match: Kwee Wee w/Paisley vs Elix Skipper w/Major GunnsA decent Cruiserweight match to open the show with Elix Skipper, representing Team Canada putting his title on the line against Kwee Wee. 1 or 2 botched moves here and there. Natural Born Thrillers' Mike Sanders interferes near the end of the match and attacks Kwee Wee with a kendo stick. Elix takes advantage and hits the Overdrive on Kwee Wee to retain the title. Not the best of matches to open a PPV_____________________________________________________________________________________________________2.) 3 Count (Shannon Moore, Evan Karagias, and Shane Helms) vs The Misfits In Action (Cpl. Cajun, Lt. Loco, and Sgt. AWOL)A match featuring 2 of WCW's goofiest Tag Teams. A solid and fun Tag Team match with a lot of high flying action from both teams, especially 3 Count. Many people may have hated 3 Count, but they were very talented and exciting to watch in the ring. Cpl Cajun gets the pinfall win for his team with a Whiplash 2000 on Shane Helms_____________________________________________________________________________________________________3.) First Blood Chain Match: The Harris Brothers vs KronikThis was a Tornado Tag Team match, to try and make the match more interesting to watch but it didn't work. Nothing exciting really going on in this match. The referee gets knocked down towards the end. Ron Harris bleeds first but the referee never saw it when he came to. Brian Adams gets nailed with a baseball bat that looks like its wrapped in barbed wire before getting pummeled with a chain. The referee sees Brian bleeding and rings the bell. Harris Brothers win this lackluster match_____________________________________________________________________________________________________General Rection cuts a patriotic pre-match promo on Lance Storm with Hacksaw Jim Duggan by his side_____________________________________________________________________________________________________4.) WCW US Championship Match: Lance Storm (c) w/Major Gunns vs General Rection  (Outside Enforcer: Hacksaw Jim Duggan)Before the match, Storm cuts a great heel promo about how great Canada is. Great promo but unfortunately, Storm never had the charisma to truly get his promos where they could've been. Another seemingly lackluster match. The only noteworthy thing about this match was Duggan's heel turn and joining Team Canada, which probably could've been seen a mile away, considering how notorious WCW was for turning superstars heel. Duggan knocks out General Rection with the 2x4 while the referee's back is turned and Storm applies the Maple Leaf on a ko'd Rection for the win. MIA comes out to try and save General Rection at the end but  they all get beat down by Hacksaw._____________________________________________________________________________________________________5.) Elimination Tag Team Match: Natural Born Thrillers (Mark Jindrak, Sean O'Haire, Chuck Palumbo, Shawn Stasiak, Reno, Johnny the Bull Stamboli, and Mike Sanders) vs Filthy Animals (Disco Inferno, Rey Mysterio, Juventud Guerrera, and Konnan w/Tygress),Vito, and Paul OrndorffWhat possessed WCW to bring Paul Orndorff on-screen for a match? This PPV was in September 2000 and Orndorff hadn't been relevant since the 80s. The match itself was an interesting and fun one to watch, but making Orndorff a part of this match brought it down a bit. Referee Charles Robinson stops the match after Orndorff injures his neck with his own piledriver on Jindrak. See? Putting him in the match was a bad idea. So basically the match goes to a no contest because of Orndorff's injury. Lame way for the match to end_____________________________________________________________________________________________________A backstage pre-match interview with Billy Kidman and Madusa. Kidman promises to throw Shane Douglas off the scaffold. Madusa goes crazy and threatens to do the same to Torrie_____________________________________________________________________________________________________6.) Tag Team Scaffold Match: Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas vs Madusa and Billy KidmanDouglas cuts a promo before Kidman and Madusa come out but I was too busy looking at Torrie to pay attention to what he was saying. This match goes nowhere. Ends with Torrie getting a low blow in on Kidman and Douglas tossing Kidman off the top of the scaffold. Torrie and Douglas climb down the ladder to win the match_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Sting is backstage cutting a pre-match promo on Dark Carnival when he's attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett for no apparent reason. Then we're shown a weird recorded segment of Mike Tenay visiting David Flair's house who asks him about the wedding where he was left at the altar by Stacy Keibler and having Stacy admit to him that he wasn't the father of her baby. David is depressed and losing his mind as his place is covered in trash, newspapers, and pizza. He's paranoid and runs outside and attacks the mailman, thinking he's the father of Stacy's baby. In case you don't know, the original route for this storyline was for Ric Flair to be revealed as the father. At one point, Vince Russo even considered making himself the father. Thank goodness this storyline never went anywhere_____________________________________________________________________________________________________7.) Vampiro vs Great Muta vs StingThe ICP clowns take over the commentary desk and commentate with Mark Madden for duration of the match. This was a rather short match that saw Muta and Vampiro work over Sting for most of this short bout. In the end, Sting hits Muta with his bat and hits the Scorpion Death Drop on him for the win. Muta gets attacked by Dark Carnival after the match and Sting makes the save_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Mike Awesome gets off of his 70s bus and tries to pick up on Pamela Paulshock and introduces Gary Coleman as his special guest_____________________________________________________________________________________________________8.) Bunkhouse Brawl: Jeff Jarrett vs Mike AwesomeNot too bad of a hardcore type match that gets close to 10 minutes. Near the end, after one too many insults, the Buffalo Bills hit the ring and attack Jarrett. Follow this up with an interference and attack from Gary Coleman and an another interference from Sting who interferes and hits the Scorpion Death Drop on Jarrett. After all this Awesome picks up the scraps and pins Jarrett for the win. The match started off good but got pretty ridiculous at the end with all the interferences_____________________________________________________________________________________________________9.) No Disqualifications: Goldberg vs Scott SteinerThe build-up for this match was great. After Goldberg Jackhammered Steiner's freak, Midajah through a table, Scott got revenge by attacking Goldberg's girlfriend and placing her in the Steiner Recliner. Steiner had to wrestle with a mask due to Goldberg supposedly injuring his face with a lead pipe, leading up to the PPV. Great, solid, and exciting No DQ match to view. With Goldberg and Steiner being brutal wrestlers, this one was bound to be...well....brutal! Goldberg flat out dominates Steiner for the first few minutes of the match but Steiner fights back with a steel chair, busting Goldberg open. Midajah comes to the ring with a lead pipe. Russo interferes and attacks Goldberg with a pipe of his own. Midajah and Russo both attack Goldberg with pipes but Goldberg kicks out of Steiner's pin following the attacks. In the end, the numbers game is too much for Goldberg to keep up with. Steiner nails Goldberg with a pipe and locks on the Steiner Recliner. Goldberg is out and Steiner wins the match. I could've done without Russo interfering but yet it still worked._____________________________________________________________________________________________________10.) WCW World Championship Steel Cage Match: Booker T vs Kevin Nash (c)During the time when Nash had some control over booking, he booked himself as WCW World Champion (go figure). The match lasts under 10 minutes and seems more fitted to be a main event for Nitro. Back and forth action with the winner meeting Sting the next night on Nitro. Booker ends up busting Nash open near the end of the match. Booker wins the match with a Book End on Nash to win the title in a decent main event match.Overall: Not a bad Fall Brawl. Most matches delivered although there were a few matches that could've used some improvement in booking and performance. Nonetheless it doesn't take away that overall it was nicely put together PPV. Too bad more WCW PPVs couldn't be that way in its final days",0.0,1309,0.04584894795554963,0.09621043989043339,0.038895372395404464,0.0,0.042179745387305505,0.38696008350120853,0.0,0.047074229103571286,0.06970167343774976,0.052924041969883026,0.018796343308226663,0.053919437453583324,0.018374214693832425,0.1195762678463008,0.08742197382475529,0.0,0.01814141027828091,0.01871755286823436,0.0,0.01714055820834999,0.0,0.0521576054128443,0.16880909224539947,0.056550407817639516,0.0345732905916747,0.014159617495122427,0.08772828490673647,0.05189542035569985,0.0,0.012394765945625866,0.1233323844133363,0.03723110091311346,0.07995105492335955,0.1946930607427516,0.03715900100900237,0.0,0.1422025237159224,0.0,0.06103777423871206,0.050886438298122415,0.03908611676759236,0.0,0.014184165826922765,0.0,0.03820618481568305,0.0,0.04601088936209621,0.03671131032232857,0.0,0.0,0.017290585654792672,0.0,0.06943173989363408,0.02445092354492329,0.1520926718444207,0.18668677610225978,0.04984278209257548,0.01722782106024344,0.015510629124699768,0.0,0.0907418762406117,0.01964933660158295,0.0,0.01682095422234353,0.01662924688353168,0.0,0.0,0.020186633571785895,0.01395932226047666,0.03126719882379592,0.0,0.0,0.07291174172421573,0.5872144812558274,0.0,0.0,0.019030828095785095,0.02968915262443138,0.04396690967126633,0.11466895297030391,0.015840630329774157,0.27025521508705586,0.09415556373439155,0.0,0.11189158225677652,0.015447759326534971,0.15832096768550727,0.05384743199926878,0.03799508887605621,0.018484320960890248,0.01612004739107104,0.03590264474491183,0.015274270600583083,0.047314248072150004,0.017415929270723666,0.029567370990368543,0.0,0.28887544633352724,0.0,0.012190844850130824,

202053,6300182665,A1EHD9FFW3274W,2,3,917913600,CULT MOVIES 27,"27. NIGHTHWAKS (action, 1981) Europe's most feared international terrorist Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer) has marked NY City as his next target. Two tough NY undercover cops, DaSilva (Sylvester Stallone) and partner Fox (Billy Dee  Williams), are assigned to a special task force sent to terminate Wulfgar.  They're frustrated, however, as their quarry proves more cunning and smart  than the usual lowlifes they're used to dealing with. A climactic cat and  mouse chase ensues leaving Fox wounded and Wulfgar holding UN diplomats  hostage. DeSilva manages to diffuse the situation but Wulfgar again  escapes. DeSilva, now alone, goes after the desperate terrorist who's on  the run.Critique: Unusually gritty Stallone action vehicle didn't prove  successful or widely distributed. Nevertheless, it features his best  starring role and it's a shame most fans haven't been able to pick it up  yet. Sporting a 'Serpico'-like beard, Stallone cuts down on the gung-ho  poses that 'Rambo' and 'Rocky' fans have come to get bored of. Though not a  total dud DeSilva is still a rogue cop who predictably goes over his  superiors orders. The film's international background (which includes  scenes shot in Europe and use of subtitles) give it class and sense of  time. It's funny to see how NY cops interact with foreign 'agents' and this  new international scene. The teaming of Williams and Stallone proves  surprisingly effective, counter-pointing suaveness and toughness. Also  outstanding is Rutger Hauer's wicked terrorist Wulfgar (his debut American  role). He shows the evil mindness that would dominate his later screen  personas. Smart ending too.QUOTES: Wulfgar: &quot;We're not that  different (DeSilva). I don't enjoy killing, but it's my job. Someone has to  do it.&quot;",0.6666666666666666,271,0.0,0.09141763388272993,0.0,0.08451845863541661,0.0,0.4044516666708196,0.05936209314001539,0.1118229644933246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538899032003709,0.0872944367407716,0.10329042997720109,0.0,0.0,0.0861884014263396,0.08892560917700543,0.0,0.0,0.06870028245491797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212748078665687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14236919988759375,0.05888654997159114,0.07324279709810098,0.0,0.0,0.3557581886035477,0.08826973334592216,0.0,0.045039527467313316,0.0,0.08285303556195375,0.28205033794167883,0.0,0.0,0.06738784688929009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07286469540299763,0.17441252374606514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149615397776227,0.0,0.11616439854500023,0.1605733825277355,0.11086675837816583,0.0,0.0,0.07368976881445499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2736767416666299,0.0,0.07900423306844204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225875892250414,0.14845624382537856,0.27898094281252844,0.08366166233415734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13925553387138342,0.03891307865005245,0.07525757836717642,0.3209902731951797,0.08946512315394296,0.09170859769990171,0.07594114758794973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878175428829714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827416986977547,0.1404722345698957,0.0,0.10557110266548941,0.07891121816673463,0.0,

821784,B00022FWTA,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1,2,1120694400,Totally Unnecessary and Uninspired Sequel,"I liked the idea of the half-pint James Bond-like secret agent  played by Frankie Muniz aka 'Agent Cody Banks.'  The story is not exceptionally original, but Muniz, a decent actor I suppose, carried the whole film pretty well, which was enjoyable to see.Now, finally I saw the sequel, which turned out a big disappointment.  First, you realize that everything is missing from the sequel, I mean, everything that made the original film quite a unique one.  Here, 'Cody' is no longer timid or feels intimidated before women; he just acts like an ordinary American teenager, but this time he is in London!  That's all, and Cody is assigned a job to retrieve the high-tech mind-control device that might be used to control the world's leaders at G7 (or G8 ... whatever).  But ... why do they need special agent Cody instead of ordinary spy like James Bond or any spies you can name?Because Cody has to get close to the prime suspect, who owns a boarding school, where Cody must be placed.  And for the successful mission, Cody must not disclose his identity before the kids (who wouldn't believe such nonsense anyway).  My question: Do you believe in this poorly written plot, or, more to the point, DO you care?If you should care, that's because of romance.  In the sequel, you see no Hilary Duff, who was not bad in the first film.  Instead, you get Hannah Spearritt (ex 'S-Club'), but between Muniz and her there is no chemistry.  Add to that, the gadgets are unimaginative ones; the locations are all shot like post-cards.  Side kick Anthony Anderson is same old Anthony Anderson, who is certainly funny, but we know he could be much more funny with better materials, better than doing unfunny slapsticks in the kitchen.I read that the film's script was being written during the shooting.  What were they thinking?  Did director Kevin Allen approve that?  Did MGM need the sequel that desperately?  Or quickly?  Because Frankie Muniz was reaching the age of 20, no longer a 'teenager,' no 'Cody Banks'?  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that as far as the script is concerned, the film is a very lazy, unfunny, unexciting comedy of which sole merit is that it was shot in London.  But sooner or later you can see London in another film.",0.5,389,0.0,0.0,0.068750341540321,0.0,0.037277852387957285,0.061558156249174316,0.06625667022806916,0.062405290063508145,0.03696080196427222,0.10524039118720056,0.14950744115669562,0.0,0.0,0.2017523185377344,0.038631141627088854,0.08210515855684127,0.1442980576170081,0.049626912145550074,0.0,0.0,0.23003831494558677,0.0921922831745921,0.027973321516731042,0.03748382788494504,0.09166613108316347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397261477342842,0.0,0.1226243111693534,0.04935646735190662,0.0,0.0397077524332633,0.0,0.03832612425022037,0.17594716363132842,0.0,0.2543088762824737,0.022486351185955825,0.0,0.03953577725407059,0.15042914131050306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08132752467467776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04584351283931741,0.039900017385729784,0.23011039958525675,0.09724218570533143,0.11201443011422062,0.0,0.03303775051967264,0.0,0.2467452773273655,0.0,0.04009818263295947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322702032597816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04331813744015415,0.04590632822231701,0.3037807871756122,0.4670745424419361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03935826919631585,0.07771464496195807,0.04343261639366741,0.041999163845823466,0.15674378511998313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04095752261742477,0.1499162083205648,0.0,0.0,0.049008531128715935,0.04273999818728704,0.047595361666439545,0.040497542094240606,0.0,0.1385275304847338,0.15678730364417776,0.0,0.029458149826449804,0.0,0.25857824069906565,

979510,B000EWBKP8,AA8JDQ39GVWWQ,0,0,1343001600,A Great Sunday Replacement,"I was so irritated when WGN canceled the retro Sunday night lineup. Fortunately, every show was available on DVD, including all the ALF episodes. It would begin at 7:00 and run until 2 AM. This is how I fell in love with ALF. Every Sunday I put this dvd series in and try to remember how good it was before they wrecked the line-up. That lineup had it all, for us classic tv fans; everything from WKRP to Bewitched and The Honeymooners, to name a few. I have never been able to convince the managers to start this up again. There was always the lame excuse of it coming down to decisions from the supplier. WHAT?? Since when does a buyer not call the shots. It's like me going into a store and the manager tells me I'm going to buy a SPEEDO or else. I wanted a pair of Levi's. I only wish that enough of us readers here could get together and insist that they bring back the classic line-up.ALF has become one of my favorite shows and I'm hoping that they find some lost episodes. The acting ranges from so-so to excellent. I have to give the parents and the son a two star rating, as well as the neighbors, the Oggmonicks? Five star ratings go out to Andrea Elson, whom I never remembered as being such a ""babe"". Aside from that, try to catch her expressions of impatience and mild anger. Those looks are authentic. Then, lastly, there is ALF. He was 5 stars all the way! Although a character, his acting/voice were top-notch.",0.0,268,0.0,0.0,0.15421005584074923,0.0,0.0,0.24547140663720832,0.04953888027693304,0.13997782483462573,0.055269808674201205,0.0,0.0,0.07125885804692186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14246574128351674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04183026466000773,0.22420768873794578,0.06853706166559978,0.05613920808904426,0.0,0.06858395723426444,0.05940500389464894,0.09828405956251061,0.061122611496067306,0.07380582569640279,0.0,0.059377496245628984,0.14732579398730103,0.0,0.07517281284776114,0.07202396809626802,0.06914255195825188,0.16812626644709056,0.0,0.0,0.05623653585285235,0.06983377532804164,0.0,0.13805151771618915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059665002105156836,0.0,0.04847078267935557,0.16750221294297502,0.04626028816936521,0.04940342344339208,0.06830383883992505,0.0614956185309003,0.0,0.05996133104603987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197274365793004,0.0,0.08003476245697672,0.1660352684172881,0.06198316380139697,0.0,0.0,0.20648295065680308,0.4656306000847384,0.0,0.0,0.07545229374622116,0.11770978402096569,0.17431738476817465,0.09742127892483514,0.0,0.3683252994467081,0.0,0.07653269959846415,0.19012332042835553,0.0,0.22417912249438554,0.0,0.07532033268234158,0.0,0.06391180377607845,0.07117233375039733,0.06055851833214304,0.12505914179362862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04405062169315658,0.06585302475855043,0.0,

Its a bunch of couples and Jennifer Aniston moaping about melodramatic boring issues and having some of the most unintelligible conversations I have ever heard. If Woody Allen were dead he would roll over in his grave. This movie is an obvious attempt at his style and brand of motion picture.. However, even Allen's worse film is better than this! The film doesnt even try to answer the questions it asks and, nothing could have been worse than the abrupt and pointless ending. The all star cast probably questioned what they signed onto after seeing the final cut..

717034,B00006IUFW,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,0,0,1214611200,"A wonderful, sweet parable","Watch this with your family (all ages invited) or thoughtfully alone.  It's a story, from the Joseph Girzone novel, of a stranger that arrives in a small town.  The tale unfolds obviously into a 21st century mirror of Jesus' experiences in the 1st century gospel story . . . healing, Pharisees, patience and compassion, persecution, love.Without question, any believer will take issue with SOME theological difference they can locate in this presentation.  But if you are a follower of Jesus, or Yeshua if you prefer, I encourage you to set aside theological wrangling and don't miss the opportunity to enjoy this. Let your imagination run with this ""what if"" of a visit by Jesus.Some critical production observations -- the hometown scenes early in the movie are indeed a bit trite.  Much of the humor is corny, and some of the ""good people"" a bit oafish, many examples of over-characterization. The town is too clean.  Even the ruins of a destroyed church are orderly (a typical Hollywood treatment).  Kind of a made-for-TV feel, but still, this keeps it safe for kids.  There is much wisdom in the story (the Gospel story!), so please try to get past some of the Hollywood weaknesses and think about the tale. By the way, Kurt Fuller delivers nicely as Joshua, and F. Murray Abraham is spot on as an unlikeable priest.The payoff -- the story builds toward a trip to the Vatican for Joshua and an audience with the Pope.  A bit of awesome footage of that location, and a very profound ending.I'll give it 4 stars for enjoyability and the inspiring story.  It could have been handled more carefully, I'll reserve a star for that. I expect that you will enjoy it.",0.0,288,0.053434372462818985,0.0,0.045330370888139945,0.0,0.09831624610437083,0.21647051182166294,0.13105852427613404,0.08229355318334527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284007446961942,0.0,0.07601422955628066,0.1018853980099092,0.05413583708567237,0.0,0.06544276823036764,0.0,0.05992907224917523,0.0,0.0,0.18444141671396896,0.04942974194056134,0.06043984112346059,0.049506715567320135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04333620964019551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15162142221055028,0.16572905063723964,0.06351479160368725,0.12194759313193243,0.14826321096638204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06158335626455312,0.06679074223700039,0.0,0.053623106072212864,0.0,0.039469398203122556,0.0,0.12090723584857764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3545109250523763,0.04079492758128105,0.0,0.0,0.10846059995776232,0.0,0.0,0.06870059297549472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0488064170448132,0.2186409794317862,0.34274050583919885,0.0,0.14567063634319075,0.5132741105216616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05190155860208751,0.051240962599430714,0.14318595120088026,0.0,0.11811272504808681,0.06583981120231387,0.0,0.0,0.05401048632808222,0.0,0.06275615615880173,0.06642171155364604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05340391224422752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11410395250599523,0.15538527691859727,0.0,0.1704929356258823,

906150,B0009IW88K,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0,0,1287878400,"shows signs of predictability, but still very compelling storytelling...a review with ample spoilers","The second season of FX's drama Nip/Tuck (2004) continues to explore the turbulent lives of Miami plastic surgeons Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh), as they take on more provocative cases.  Matching the edginess and raw sensuality of the first season, is a challenge that is not quite met.  The writing while very good, resembles something like a soap opera for most of the season, before ramping things up for a cliffhanger finish.  This season aired six years ago, and there are spoilers ahead, so proceed as you will.Holdover story elements from the initial season are followed up, as womanizing playboy Christian has become a father to his ex-girlfriend Gina Russo's (Jessalyn Gilsig) baby boy Wilbur.  He can still be a cynical prick, but a more human side of Dr. Troy is on display, rather than just a superficial user of women.  When Wilbur's real father becomes involved (Georg Stanford Brown), there are unexpected consequences, when the child is lost in a custody battle.A massive upheaval occurs in the McNamara household, as Julia (Joely Richardson) learns that Christian is the real father of her seventeen year old son Matt (John Hensley), and not her husband Sean.  Matt becomes romantically involved with his life coach Ava (Famke Jansen).  When these explosive developments come to light, Julia is kicked out of the house, while Sean has a fling with Kimber (Kelly Carlson), one of Christian's ex-girlfriends.  Like Christian, Sean undergoes a radical transformation.  While he remains compassionate to his patients, and his plan to end his partnership with Christian fizzles, his consuming anger towards Julia, makes him quite ornery and vindictive, as he creates shockwaves throughout the season.With so much drama on the home front, happenings in the office, and the importance of the patients is somewhat diminished.  Aesthetician Liz Cruz (Roma Mafia) attempts to get pregnant by artificial means, but otherwise is mainly in the background.  The graphic presentation of various surgical procedures remains ""cutting edge"", but is becoming routine.  There isn't much time given to patients, and the surgical procedures and recoveries seem rushed.  Things are rather mundane, until the partners head up to New York to participate in a procedure to separate Siamese twins joined at the head.  Jenny O'Hara has a brief but very touching performance as a bereaved mother, as Sean and Christian reconcile their differences by sharing a prostitute.Famke Jansen is great in the role of Ava Moore, although the character is somewhat predictable, and written as a clich&eacute;.  The big twist at the end may not play out as expected, but that it is clear that something dramatic is coming for some time.  The most troubling character is Matt, portrayed by the then 27 year old John Hensley, who engages in some pretty eclectic behavior for a high schooler.  The writers too conveniently resolve a situation where Matt was involved in a hit and run, before plunging the teen into a relationship with the rather diabolical Ava.  Reality continues to be overstretched, as incest is mixed in, and Matt has plans to take Ava away to Paris (seriously???).Joey Slotnick reprises his role as Dr. Merril Bobolit, who despite having lost his license, illegally practices medicine and perform surgery under the influence of drugs.  A fatal surgical mishap is swept away much too easily, a trend that is much too common in season two, where various sticky situations just go away.  And is it really plausible that Christian is unaware of locking wheel nuts?The dark criminal element that was a huge factor in season one, begins to resurface with the appearance of a sadistic rapist called ""The Carver"", who slices open the cheeks of his victims.  Sean's efforts to patch up The Carver's victims, eventually makes him a target of violence, leading to a dramatic cliffhanger ending that sets the stage for the third season.  Robert LaSardo returns as the spirit of drug dealer Escobar Gallardo, to advise Sean to turn to violence.With their personal lives in a mess, the relationship between Sean and Christian is severely tested again, but still manages to hold together.  Nip/Tuck remains a very entertaining series in season two, with the focus on the family.  The outstanding ensemble cast continues to be terrific.  The writing is creative, and delivers some surprises, but it is not as strong, and there are signs of sloppiness and predictability.  The show has a very talented ensemble cast, with guest appearances by such notables as Jill Claybugh, Vanessa Redgrave, Rebecca Gayheart, Mary Page Keller, Joan Rivers, and Alec Baldwin.  It is a continuing disappointment that there are no commentary tracks or extended interviews with the stars of this outstanding drama.",0.0,777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24478269725898408,0.11855973841840825,0.2605588432717018,0.04409179229336193,0.06277241323908019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203385864336607,0.09216879408209501,0.024486506007101703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027494824143116783,0.08342580629496248,0.022357863812867456,0.027337907981283945,0.022392680216852024,0.0231229342949664,0.0,0.11847666726824764,0.0,0.07314134665451885,0.058879001297590404,0.06321916557828894,0.21315925138400074,0.0,0.0,0.1949009490266208,0.028728757323586592,0.3171633826506394,0.05364945960237254,0.0,0.04716356751479995,0.0448630041898368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048509179118399665,0.058056980188391366,0.0,0.0,0.10937655779564225,0.0,0.02745064880589757,0.07733566420657484,0.26725161381669554,0.07380879602526316,0.03941185137599055,0.0,0.024529233086362425,0.0,0.04783447993641375,0.0,0.0,0.02660144237462601,0.0,0.032697102394435684,0.0,0.03192408484081459,0.04415184796206744,0.07417111211999658,0.02583783653277922,0.027381606747681884,0.14825061334176323,0.5339728286196761,0.055697186971891875,0.0,0.030096240096711312,0.11737953035405368,0.0231771079204889,0.025906119442943715,0.050102224799531275,0.28047745379549155,0.0893412027578262,0.06105437987377862,0.1011146127881604,0.09771923140865893,0.03576802432516633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07482496099526888,0.0,0.07013883146932694,0.025805522449486272,0.17570812245227965,0.0,0.019279171234411696,
184097,1565672178,ARA48345JZPZR,5,6,1019520000,Wind it Up with a Bang!,"This is the 6th and last entry in the series Lone Wolf & Cub.  This one not only has a different director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous comic book series).Not that that is bad.The whole series fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not taking itself too seriously.  It was at once graphic and fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable,  factual and imaginary. serious & silly.  That's what made it so damn interesting.Throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of Japan.  Tracing actual historical roads and cities.  Now we end the series in the mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title.This entry has a lot of stuff going on:  Lord Retsudo of the hated Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter to do in Ogami with her ""Falling Dagger"" technique. When, predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe.The downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad.  That Ogami's Baby Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them, behead them, or run em through.  Red sprays all over the white snow.Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang.  One of the strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced anywhere.

34976,0780626699,AQP1VPK16SVWM,176,179,1094774400,Great collection of classics and minor gems from the master,"It's rare that an artist can be both popular and one of the best at what he or she does. Alfred Hitchcock embodied both these elements. His films used suspenseful thrillers as a vehicle to try out inventive and often groundbreaking editing and camera techniques. While this collection from Warner Brothers doesn't include all his best films, there are enough here to justify picking up this generous and beautifully remastered collection of some of Hitch's best films.""Suspicion"" is the oldest of the nine films included in this boxed set. Cary Grant plays Johnny Aysgarth a womanizing gambler who flirts with the bookish Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine in her Oscar winning role). After he woos and marries her, Lina begins to suspect that Johnny may be trying to kill her for her money. Although RKO forced Hitchcock to change the ending from the one he wanted (I'll let you watch the short documentary on the film that's included to find out what occurred) and the film was seriously compromised by studio interference, it's still a worthwhile thriller that has Grant playing a cad at a point in his career when he was put into romantic leads. I'd be suspicious of anyone who said he loved me and still called me ""monkey face"".""Foreign Correspondent"" was made by Hitchcock while he was on loan from David O. Selznick's studio. Hitchcock relished the opportunity to work elsewhere as Selznick interfered too much with the making of the films he produced. Shot just as World War II was erupting in Europe dragging in other countries into the fray, the film stars Joel McCrea as reporter Johnny Jones (what's with all these Johnny's in Hitch's films?) discovers a conspiracy of fascists threatening to take over Europe. McCrea gives a energetic performance and, although he wasn't Hitch's first choice (Henry Fonda was his first choice but the production couldn't afford him), he more than lives up to the potential of the role.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" features Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery in a screw-ball (!) comedy directed by the master of suspense. Hitch directed the film as a favor to Carole Lombard a very good friend at the time.  While the script has some clever moments and Hitch's direction has a number of nice set pieces, it's one of Hitchcock's lesser works. It's still worth viewing.""Strangers on a Train"" is a flawed masterpiece from Hitch. Guy (Farley Granger) frustrated because his unfaithful wife won't give him a divorce so he can remarry, chats with Bruno (the marvelous Robert Walker in one of his best roles) a passenger he meets on the train back to Washington D.C.  After a drink Guy spills the beans about his wife and Bruno offers to swap murders. In essence, their crime will be perfect because their complete strangers and have no other connection other than the meeting on the train. Guy believes Bruno is joking and plays along. When Guy's wife is brutally murdered (in a stunning sequence where we see the murder reflected in the woman's glasses), Bruno expects Guy to reciprocate. Otherwise, he threatens to pin the murder on Guy. The stunning conclusion on the merry-go-round ranks as one of Hitch's best. This edition includes both the final theatrical version and ""preview"" versions of the film which differ slightly.""Dial M for Murder"" caught Hitchcock recharging his batteries. Whenever he felt the need to creatively regenerate, he'd pick a subject that would interest him technically but that was already put together. It's ironic, though, that he should pick another main character who is a tennis player. ""Dial M"" plays as a inverted version of ""Strangers"". Based on Frederick Knott's Broadway hit play, ""Dial M for Murder"" was originally shot in 3-D (and it's a wonderful film to see in that format if for no other reason than to see what a great film director can do with the format with subtly and style) but only exhibited in that format in certain venues. Ray Milland (subbing for Cary Grant who had an argument with Hitchcock and withdrew from the film) plays a slick tennis player who devises the perfect murder. He blackmails an old college chum (the impressive Anthony Dawson) to fake a break in and murder his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly). It seems that Milland has discovered that she had an affair with an American mystery writer (Bob Cummings). The inspector (the droll John Williams) in the case recognizes that appearances can be deceiving when he investigates a murder.Hitch believed ""Stage Fright"" to be one of his miscalculations because of a technical narrative trick he used to clue in viewers on the story. Richard Todd plays an actor being pursued for the murder of a lover's (Marlene Dietrich) husband.  Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) believes her male friend is innocent and goes undercover to try and catch the real killer. It's a marvelous and underrated Hitchcock minor classic with a brilliant opening sequence and conclusion. The actors all give exceptional performances particularly Todd and Wyman. Playing with the artifice of the theater world, Hitch also plays with audience expectations.""I Confess"" had a troubled history during its production. Breen's censorship office (which used to censor films even at the scripting stage) objected to Hitch's story of a Priest (Montgomery Clift) who hears a murder confession and is torn about reporting it to the police. His vow prevents him from doing so but it also implicates him in the murder. Also featuring Anne Baxter and Karl Malden, ""I Confess"" isn't entirely successful but its daring theme, performances and two stunning set pieces make it a worthwhile movie.With ""The Wrong Man"" Hitch finally got his wish to work with all American icon Henry Fonda. Hitch elected to try the approach used by the Italian Neo-realism movement (best represented by DeSica's ""The Bicycle Thief"") in telling the true story of a musician named Manny who is identified as a robbery and murder suspect. This case of mistaken identity, the opposite of Hitch's later experiment with ""Psycho"", took an unusual tact with a more realistic performance style and less stylized look. It's a minor Hitchcock classic with a strong performance by Vera Miles as Manny's wife who ends up having a nervous break down due to what occurs.All the movies look exceptional. The older movies have some analog inherent analog flaws due to the age of the films but, on the whole, have never looked better. ""Strangers on a Train"" has been digitally remastered for this edition and features a sharper image with less grain problems. The blacks, grays and whites are solid and less murky looking than on the previous edition. ""Dial M for Murder"" suffers from haloing due to the 3-D process used to shoot the movie but the colors are vibrant and rich. ""North by Northwest"" looks terrific. It was previously released on DVD and this is the same transfer using a cleaned up restored version of the film. The restored mono sound on ""Dial M"" and the many other films included here sounds crisp with good presence.Making up for some of their oversights in the past, Warner has spent a lot of money to spiff up these classic movies. Every single movie has a short documentary on the making of the film featuring directors Richard Franklin (""Psycho 2"", ""Roadgames"", ""Flatland"") and Peter Bogdanovich (""Paper Moon"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""What's Up Doc?"") commenting on Hitch's films. Franklin's a good choice as he's demonstrated tremendous skill in his overlooked suspense films. Bogdanovich who enjoyed a friendship with Hitch and interviewed the master for his book on Hitchcock has tremendous insight. He also does a killer Hitchcock imitation. Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell a fine character actress who appeared in two of the nine films included here, provides an insider's perspective on the great director's work and his overlooked collaborator his wife Alma Reville Hitchcock. There's also a generous amount of behind-the-scenes photos included in many of the documentaries and clips from various films included in the set.Both ""North by Northwest"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" come with commentary tracks. ""North by Northwest"" features the same commentary track by the late great Ernest Lehman as the previous edition. ""Strangers on a Train"" combines comments from Bogdanovich, ""Psycho"" screenwriter Jospeh Stefano and clips from Patricia Highsmith who wrote the novel the film is based on. It's a pity that more clips of Hitch from Bogdanovich's interviews and others over the years weren't assembled to give us a running commentary from the master himself but both Bogdanovich and Stefano give great insight as they knew the man and/or worked with him and also have the distance of collaborators.A great set from Warner Brothers, ""The Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection"" should be an essential purchase for any fan of Hitch's. There's only one glaring omission from this set and that's ""Lifeboat"" which Hitchcock directed for Fox. Unfortunately, Warner wasn't able to secure the rights to include that for this DVD set. Oh, and I forgot to mention that every single title here is in the plastic Amray cases that Warner has recently begun releasing movies in so they're more durable than the cardboard sleeves for the previous editions of ""North by Northwest"" and ""Strangers on a Train"". My only complaint is with the box itself; it isn't all that sturdy and could have more details about the films and the extras. I'd also like to have seen an additional disc featuring maybe Hitchcock's films he made for the War Office during WWII as an extras here (similar to the episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" that Universal packaged with their boxed sets). Still, one can't argue with the price as it works out to be roughly $10.00 for each movie. You'd pay nearly double that to buy them separately.",0.9832402234636871,1627,0.03444448819883385,0.028911628372572284,0.05844108775458146,0.09355396295188888,0.1161891957328038,0.29070769611767766,0.028160673768100646,0.12377747590625246,0.04189127254118277,0.0795194489886031,0.042362831916391466,0.013502508489822459,0.08282289335818156,0.06533300850413261,0.12040718518810167,0.05816110229200399,0.013628918876094178,0.0,0.026995168515370694,0.012877018585057269,0.11949886724112757,0.026122620826747413,0.12681954646679555,0.1486942404460023,0.0,0.0319126697203776,0.05492230481681569,0.03898696205087215,0.10130739283073228,0.05587016344479608,0.24321860704179218,0.06992560752291507,0.09009606405130095,0.1800186349622568,0.0,0.010859681277784401,0.19229596453351758,0.02729497124554523,0.07860899714751587,0.10194387739726872,0.029363842525782946,0.011202435634910725,0.010655998757254075,0.0,0.02870278470254344,0.02615873789007821,0.05761024721101747,0.0,0.03392331335211884,0.05570293443113466,0.012989728229202345,0.011305642828849057,0.026080650178815112,0.0,0.2285223314416379,0.19284421500858331,0.07488979338192026,0.03882772706866548,0.023305035585992877,0.06672861418021328,0.0340853784512134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037478672264668875,0.0,0.02973764390128649,0.015165413664707656,0.03146124822738758,0.046979601884909586,0.036822494474741625,0.06503763462657658,0.15650196316147724,0.551438559980973,0.052917468713740784,0.013934686083871722,0.0,0.033456416541892214,0.022020391871431802,0.05537971061390467,0.011900434552718074,0.24744522249916565,0.014147064866343323,0.029003648231265267,0.08405968853045157,0.011605286218063686,0.07646158046640014,0.013484476879996547,0.0,0.01388653401203672,0.0,0.0,0.06884970629524298,0.03554530980597135,0.03925168168430497,0.12217033402262842,0.012258814143985134,0.20032672193612186,0.012478182365725201,0.01831699222330005,

Becasue I thought maybe I would end up liking it. Well, I did and I didn't. I love slasher flicks, but im not really into zombie movies.  The two other zombie movies I have seen were &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, which I didn't like, and thought were WAY over-rated. This one was to, and certainly is NOT worth all the hye, but is still okay. The thing I liked about was that is was simple, sort of in the way &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was, but it's hard to explain HOW it was simple. It mostly takes place in the living room and cellar of a cabin, not in a big gothic mansion, so it's some-what realistic, and, like &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, it's hard to explain HOW it's realistic. There were also a few cool scenes worth the rental alone. What I didn't like about it was it was some-what boring. It was also just felt a *bit* too short.

I am bummed to see that Disney has no plans currently to release this in 3D which is what i saw at the movies. I am a huge Disney movie fan but this is the best movie since Lion King (Tangled and Brave were both great but I loved Frozen). My 3 yr old niece loves this movie and she actually never saw it in the theatres just the previews and all she wanted was Frozen merchandise for Christmas.

Both films, witty and hugely entertaining, featured characters you can identify with, had lots of funny jokes and clever parodies of a certain film genre. Then in 2003 he made awful ""The Cat in the Hat."" We waited for five years since then and what we get is ""The Love Guru,"" another disappointing film from Mike Myers.""The Love Guru"" has none of the style that made ""Austin Powers"" such a success. Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, an American-born self help guru raised in India. Without letting us know how and why he was raised in India and became a guru, the film proceeds to tell us that Guru Pitka is hired by a hockey team owner played by Jessica Alba because her team's star player, she believes, really needs the help of the spiritual leader. But why a hockey player?I know comedy is a subjective thing. Not everybody is going to laugh at the same thing. Don't get me wrong. I like silly jokes. I like sex jokes. But something is definitely wrong with the comedy when the actors start to look like desperate standup comic or clown waiting for laughs that will never come, trying to make us laugh with whatever gags he thinks of - cross-eyed Ben Kingsley's mentor, repetitious ""Mariska Hargitay"" mantra and of course, elephants.Perhaps ""The Love Guru,"" Mike Myers's Razzie-winning comedy, does not deserve the award given to the year's worst film. Compare it with any films directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and their ""spoofs,"" and maybe Myers's latest effort will look slightly better.

The Simpsons, however, has broken the general rule by remaining consistently funny since its debut in 1989.I sincerely hope that Fox soon releases DVDs for seasons 2-11. My favorite episode was the one several years ago where Lisa and Marge left Homer and Bart to help clean up an oilspill. While preparing for bed one night, Bart yells to Homer, &quot;Dad, do I have to brush my teeth tonight?&quot; Homer replied &quot;No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.&quot; I almost lost it when those lines were uttered! There should be a Homer Simpson book on how to raise children!!!",0.125,152,0.08946667556006904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230683066994143,0.13591600422752317,0.0,0.0,0.0816068060208683,0.07745441776827965,0.0,0.0,0.10756276717262264,0.06363638328860795,0.08529479647584283,0.0,0.10619992867508775,0.0,0.10517653663391471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852892768654135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771249160778113,0.07255903698654508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876451158590736,0.0,0.05549696392357687,0.0,0.05104507289599748,0.09929650883242419,0.11440518540816018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10745411955287507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761927667139913,0.10161345936427818,0.0,0.09892793861675944,0.13660819364728574,0.14588997828731795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17706783608647853,0.0,0.6744399470006709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12195022566619937,0.30078625744097814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690024211935704,0.0,0.0,0.09273114853724924,0.24719932985892465,0.0,0.0,0.09357343127238797,0.0,0.06620085215481235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050871528913451,0.0,0.09232596756077349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13008297390000098,0.0,0.0,
786814,B0000VD02Y,A3RC3AK8UN89I9,3,5,1078185600,Cute movie,"UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is your standard romantic comedy, but well worth watching. Diane Lane stars, playing Frances, a newly divorced woman who goes on a gay tour of Italy at the suggestion of her gay friend Patti (Sandra Oh). She sees a house and before even thinking about anything, if it's even on sale, she decides she wants to buy it and put everything into it. She meets a bunch of different people and tries to readapt her life in a foreign country where she knows no one, except a handful of people she has just met. The movie is pretty predictable in what will happen, and how it ends, but it was still a fun movie to watch and get swept away in. The visuals were absolutely beautiful and watching it I felt as though I was taken along for the trip. Diane Lane was fabulous in this movie.

And as I strongly believe in ""learning through imitation"", I have no right to criticize him for attempting to reproduce the kind of film he enjoys. But that doesn't mean ""The Locusts"" is successful.""The Locusts"" is a mechanical copy of plays and films from an era Kelley (probably) hasn't lived through. It's noteworthy that Kelley has a character talk about ""the parameters of a relationship"", something no one outside academia would have said in 1960 (assuming /anyone/ said it). When Flyboy asks Clay if he wants to hear one of his late father's records, it's an LP, not a 78. And how dumb can you be to name the villainess ""Mrs Potts""? (Angela Lansbury would likely have played the part more-convincingly than Kate Capshaw.)The ending is poorly motivated and ludicrously overwrought, more likely to provoke laughter than tears.With the exception of Jeremy Davies' Flyboy, the performances are uniformly flat and uninteresting. The writing is uneven and the direction uninspired; the actors wind up looking bad. The photography is similarly dull and devoid of atmosphere.If you're new to screenwriting (as I am), I nevertheless encourage you to see ""The Locusts"", as a outstanding example of how /not/ to write a genre film.",0.0,226,0.0687428720804479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12648302614736173,0.278487498167965,0.056201897481098516,0.21173993213692527,0.0,0.11902619828844593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048895834439874795,0.0,0.13929060087073453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13008591938787586,0.0,0.047456467180661106,0.06359094849581952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06739502225499264,0.16725501087265526,0.13868729877927966,0.0,0.08990498233386594,0.06736381480618629,0.16714122571420276,0.13003979213227662,0.08528361354592245,0.0,0.19610569491154933,0.11444362655656165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13797135257248042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15615201962076738,0.10998027988299941,0.26604394378462215,0.0,0.1120964432001376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07479837001388191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15575927637796153,0.093702026041246,0.5282582711545493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3039020605960495,0.0,0.0,0.1437967014157687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709398459035459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049975463929293175,0.149420613692136,0.16450329896508,

Bones remains stoically on the job at the Jeffersonian Institute and in the field despite her advancing pregnancy, while Booth will become increasingly frantic in his often misguided efforts to protect her.  Series fans will be treated to the full humor of a lively debate over where to live and how to raise their child.  The blessed event itself will have all the suspense that awkward timing in the middle of a tense case can give it.The changes will ripple through the Jeffersonian forensic lab.  Dr. Sweets gets increased field duty as a substitute partner for Booth, and cannot help psychoanalyzing everything.  Bones' best friend Angela will attempt to prepare her for working motherhood, while Dr. Saroyan will try to keep the lab functioning while minding an unending parade of interns.  The entire Jeffersonian team will be involved in a chilling season-ending cliff-hanger episode.""Bones"" contines to feature a crime of the week, to be solved through a combination of exotic forensics work by the lab rats and Booth's old-fashioned police work.  However, the best part of the series is the fun interaction of the Jeffersonian staff and the ""opposites attract"" relationship of Bones and Booth.  The seventh season is highly recommended to its fans.",0.9135802469135802,252,0.0,0.0,0.04658696635361112,0.0,0.05052082698132119,0.19466234715377978,0.0,0.04228739935453159,0.050091144245506654,0.142627089653178,0.0,0.0,0.1320463904569895,0.0,0.05235487285913406,0.05563652737495347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582171428395847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04453752530246876,0.0,0.2675615023681401,0.0,0.05381395016055422,0.06676083900708699,0.0,0.20438783679680075,0.0,0.06266404076155035,0.03047463802056092,0.07022314588869766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643382618279808,0.04192579679784585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485841411528519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03742718679037381,0.580252743875947,0.1265512550778308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30346726929098417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4104345303648446,0.0,0.0,0.0,

You know, mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.""""A kiss can be deadlier...., if you mean it.""""Oh my God. Does this mean we have to fight?"" - Selena Kyle & Bruce Wayne celebrate Christmas a little early, by unmasking each other in ""Batman Returns""Michael Keaton returns as The Dark knight, with Tim Burton at the helm, directing the more gothic and darker second installment to the ""Batman"" quadrilogy simply titled ""Batman Returns"". I give the film four stars, but, it just made the cut.Even as Gotham City celebrates the holiday season, crime doesn't take a vacation. Batman goes up against two villians in ""Returns"".After blackmailing Gotham's most corrupt businessman & socialite, Max Shreck, The Penguin rears his ugly head (& flippers) trying to fit in with society, by trying to impeach the mayor and running for the position, while, winning over the citizens of Gotham City. But, the birdman has a more secretive, darker plan in store for the city & its children.Meanwhile, Max Shreck has problems of his own. After his new mousy secretary, Selina Kyle, uncovers a plan to control all the energy being generated through Gotham City, he decides to terminate her by pushing her out the top window of his own company tower. But, due to some bizarre feline circumstances she survives & becomes a lot more ""yummier"" as Catwoman.With Gotham City once again in danger, it looks like Batman won't be having a very Merry Christmas.A lot darker in tone than 1989's ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"" is a somber film that takes itself a bit too seriously (I always wondered if this film hit too close to home with Burton). The cast is the best out of all four ""Bat"" films. Devito was born to play the role of The Penguin. Keaton is great as Batman, but is too brooding as Bruce Wayne (we first see Wayne sitting in a chair in a darkened room, in Wayne Manor, doing his best impersonation of ""The Thinker"", when the bat-signal streams into the room. Your parents are dead - get over it already!). Michelle Pfeifer is just the p*ssy this film needs as she gives a great, sexy performance as Catwoman. Christopher Walken gives the film a boost as the menacing, Max Shreck.All the bat-gadgets are back with a few new cool ones thrown in (the bat-glider was cool), but, the sets are what give the film its downfall. There aren't that many and it seems like the same sets are used over and over and over again. It reminded too much of the Kenner playsets you can buy at the store for twenty bucks (action figures not included). It seems there were, all total, 6 to 8 sets used for the film.Danny Elfman's score to ""Batman Returns"" is decent at best using only the main theme from the previous film & using original material for this installment (the results are a mixed bag).The film isn't bad, but, I've watched this a few times over the years and with the new crop of comic book films coming out (""Spider-Man"", ""X-Men"", etc.) this film looks like it needed a shot in the arm. For me, the film stays at a certain somber level thru out the course of the film only waking up during the action scenes.The DVD definitely needs a much needed Special Edition kick in the ass. The audio is the standard Dolby Surround with no special features at all. Nothing.

1278149,B002MEW7YY,AMJMFXM2V0GLF,5,5,1304726400,Brilliant Edgardo in Highland gloom,"This opera is going to lie close to my heart, not least because of its story brought to life by an excellent cast and principal characters. There's much that impressed and little that didn't. Transferring the storyline from early eighteenth century to the Victorian period was in my very humble opinion, a believable move.The setting of gloom - bare trees in a darkened landscape set the tone for the pending tragedy that would unfold. There's always drama behind the drama, so I feel I should mention here that Piottr Beczala stepped in for an ""ailing"" Villazon. I have never heard Villiazon, so I had no frame of reference, except to note that I hear Beczala in other operas. To step in at short notice and produce what would be a standout performance is what professionalism is about. Beczala steals the show for me.Netrebko has a beautiful clear lilt which I liked and her ""mad scene"" about which so much has already been written, quite powerful. While some here may have reservations about her almost playfulness in Act 1 in the light of her mother's recent demise, her love for Edgardo places her in a situation where's she displays conflict - the vacillation between joy and sadness is palpable. The descent into madness must be gradual and the scene between Lucia and Enrico solidifies this aspect.I must once again say that Piotr Beczala with this performance entrenched his position as one of the finest lyrical tenors today. His aria ""Fra poco a me ricovero"" was delivered with such powerful passion, the enthusiastic applause at the end of it was very well deserved.Now I feel justified in having purchased this DVD.Viva Beczala!",1.0,280,0.17770535981341126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898929586717558,0.20997391982504834,0.0,0.04561360289498496,0.10806233521310667,0.10256381378866253,0.07285251024741388,0.06966188946447394,0.0,0.0,0.056472954512821194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06963648445805669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16357125852880672,0.05479575332116423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06704693534021511,0.11614737952215716,0.09608143437907841,0.0,0.3607588875555335,0.0,0.11609359716139594,0.0,0.0,0.3306965821917544,0.07040985277944334,0.1351860230102424,0.03287168419566845,0.0757466938023087,0.0,0.0,0.06826874400071983,0.0,0.1349576716654029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13403272625354204,0.11665572240324672,0.06727740150238261,0.047384513277527344,0.1964980236209498,0.0,0.048296252808514406,0.0,0.0,0.06885300384951903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671094833773905,0.07824111876620478,0.1623142839038102,0.06059407102129129,0.06332464178388583,0.0,0.24222660108554428,0.3982960118641455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11507181265739941,0.0,0.12698398580343617,0.0,0.19640227194412785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197475515509882,0.13149305234021696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0624794886158949,0.0,0.11840270601609218,0.0,0.13500436173756344,0.0,0.0,0.08612682334059901,0.12875441053547915,0.0,

255064,6301543408,AF1XW6L35BR49,1,1,1065052800,"The Classic ""Bad Episode"" on the Big Screen","Classic ""Star Trek"" had its share of bad episodes.  They're part of the ""Star Trek"" canon.  Like the episode ""Spock's Brain,"" in which the lobotomized Vulcan stiffly stumbles around papier mache sets with his pals in search of his stolen brain.  (His rigid locomation is triggered by a pie plate on his head that Dr. McCoy wired to a garage door opener).  As the story progresses, the gang discovers the culprits: a race of bikini-clad bimbos who are almost as brainless as the post-surgical Spock.  Imagine a young, gorgeous Gracie Allen in go-go boots. (You can find this video gem at Amazon, too.).Like it or not, that's part of classic ""Star Trek.""  And ""Star Trek V"" fits into that heritage.  But don't just think of it as ""bad.""  Enjoy it for the classic cliches that it recycles with reckless abandon: the group of renegades that takes over the Enterprise, the waves of intense(though not particularly thoughtful) Klingon hostility, the transporter that won't work, the communications officer (Uhura) who breaks into song, the transporter that won't work, the lavishly choreographed fistfights, the paradise that really isn't a paradise.  And of course, there's the cheezy special effects.  Sound familiar, Trek fans?And for the first time in the history of Trek movies, you get that classic esprit d'corps between Spock, Kirk and McCoy, who were conspicuously split up (always for a different reason...or lack of reason) in movies 2-4, then again in 6.What you get is a new ""episode.""  Not the best episode by any means, but an episode nonetheless.  Really that's what most Trek fans wanted.  What fan wouldn't have fought off a pack of Klingons to get 20 or 30 episodes added to the stingy 79 that were rerun over and over and over?  Wouldn't it be great to go off on more adventures with the crew of the Enterprise?  Not desk-bound Admiral Kirk, meloncholy about aging--CAPTAIN Kirk sitting in his chair on the bridge like that's where he's always been...and like that's where he'll always be.  (In fact, the key lighting on the sets is so intense and the makeup is so heavy that the aging actors look at least five years younger than they were).  And the family of characters all serving and interacting together with a chemistry you just can't get in any other incarnation of ""Star Trek.""Sure, it's got its downside.  Probably the worst aspect is that the crew doesn't act--it always RE-acts to the mischief of the villains.  (Kirk's sole response to someone hijacking HIS ship is to send a message to Star Fleet requesting a ""rescue ship""?  Not even a discussion about turning the tables on the assailants? Incredible that writer/director Shatner could play the part so long and learn so little about it).  And then there's Spock's incomprehensible refusal to shoot the leader of the renegades...the only chance any of them had to prevent the bad guys from taking over the ship.  He later claims he's afraid he'd kill the guy because the weapon fires bullets and there's no stun setting.  So wouldn't the logical thing be to shoot him repeatedly in the legs?So, I only give it three stars because of these and a few other serious blunders (Checkov the navigator gets lost in the woods?  Scotty brags about knowing the ship like the back of his hand, then absentmindedly knocks himself unconscious on a low-hanging beam?).You won't find the kinds of missing scenes and other juicy revitalizing elements that have characterized other releases.

Almost everything in this movie sucked, from the weak and monotonous set design, the overacted (but underdeveloped) characters, the predictable plot, the almost comically inept abilities of the military characters, the annoying musical score, the dumbed-down symbolism of Ripley as the 'mother' of the aliens (complete with a laughable scene where the alien looks at Ripley with googly eyes and almost says, ""mama...?""), etc.I had a sort of respect for the first two movies in this franchise for their innovative set design, use of special effects, etc. but the third and ESPECIALLY the fourth installments are just cheesy.I guess die-hard Alien fans need to see this, but for all others, be forewarned... this movie is a predictable and poorly made waste of time.",0.0,127,0.0,0.0,0.0896258431440158,0.0,0.0,0.21399948597055568,0.08637498811002972,0.08135416658706354,0.09636731876841892,0.09146387330965262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22543956561935732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12018574636532779,0.21880320623616956,0.09773099604117788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195815984845092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310697936575333,0.0,0.06027777646472128,0.0,0.0,0.10308101142077714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15607540918079243,0.1281398752779433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3504641583452968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495534154823653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6596395664059634,0.12173214769118379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22648235787745408,0.10950376061238745,0.05838223006488659,0.0,0.13344086464796204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10558860579122699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15361154324505363,0.0,0.0,

It's interesting stuff to hear the first time, but when you see it over and over again, it becomes annoying.  There should be an option where one can just play the videos one after the other with no interruption.  Of course, the videos themselves are as good as the music, which varies wildly from religiously centered songs that seem to suggest a hard kernel of faith to songs that seem to celebrate, or at least dryly relate, violent incidents.

They make the cops/feds have zero IQ's and the bad guys are geniuses.  That is, until McClane shows up.  Then the bad guys all of a sudden have zero IQ's and he's the genius.

1631614,B00BEIYOHC,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0,0,1397865600,Solid filmmaking triumphs over cliches,"***1/2Haunted house movies have become so similar and generic in their content and style, that's it's getting harder and harder to tell a good one from a bad one these days. &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; strikes me as a fairly good one - at least up to a point. It's not that there's anything particularly groundbreaking or new about it; it's just that the level of filmmaking is a notch or two above what one frequently finds in the genre.Written by Leigh Wannell and directed by James Wan, &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; follows the standard blueprint for films in this genre: a couple with young children finds itself bedeviled by restless spirits in an old Victorian house that, just from the looks of it, practically screams &#34;Haunted.&#34; We're already familiar with most of the characters from the original &#34;Insidious,&#34; including Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson as the distraught parents and &#34;Entity&#34; star Barbara Hershey as the grandmother. There's the usual calling in of ghost-hunters and the standard mumbo-jumbo about &#34;the other side,&#34; but at least &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; goes that extra step by actually entering into that alternate world and confronting the spirits residing therein.&#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; is a bit too derivative of &#34;The Shining&#34; in the dad's seeming descent into madness and possession and his posing a threat to the safety of his family (a baseball bat and a fire extinguisher have replaced the ax in the earlier picture as the weapon of choice here). And even though the movie wanders off into some pretty goofy territory in its second half, the excellent cinematography, imagery and sound effects manage to keep the fright meter in the red zone for most of the duration.And credit those who made the film for having the good taste to include a brief clip of Herk Harvey's seminal 1962 classic &#34;Carnival of Souls,&#34; one of the creepiest horror films of all time, playing on a TV nearby.

337411,6302814138,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,1,1,1391126400,Final Lean Film Fitting End,"I think the one David Lean film that is most often criticized as a &#34;failure&#34; was probably &#34;Ryan's Daughter&#34; (1972), although, I can see why, but the film has my vote to attest to its greatness.  My choice of his weakest film is 1965's &#34;Doctor Zhivago,&#34; as far as the arc of the story goes, but still quite spectacular.  With &#34;A Passage to India&#34; (1984) Lean himself is responsible for the screenplay and listening to some of his reflections included as an extra on the Columbia Pictures DVD, his straying from E.M. Forster's novel is purely for the sake of cinematic license and well taken, although the actual mindset of &#34;Adela Quested,&#34; (Judy Davis) around which the plot pivots, should have been expressed more specifically.  Peggy Ashcroft received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the memorable character, &#34;Mrs. Moore&#34; and Victor Banerjee as &#34;Dr. Aziz&#34; and James Fox are excellent as is Alec Guinness to a lesser degree.  The film received 11 AA nominations.  As with all the best of David Lean's films, one must commend Maurice Jarre for exquisite soundtrack music.  Photography by Ernest Day and production design by John Box are extraordinary.  Lean also did the editing.  All of Lean's work on this film is masterful and one the whole, it is again a monumental achievement and the last film he made.  Just as heroic as &#34;Bridge on the River Kwai&#34; and &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; with less epic adventure, but still towering.

The FX's are cool but the story is confusing and tedious. Cage and Co. are bland and don't appear too interested in what they're doing. It's not terrible but it's far from great. The extended edition is an improvement, but this could have been a better film.Why did Ghost Rider get two films and Daredevil just one? The Daredevil movie is better than either of the two Ghost Rider flicks?The bigger slap in the face is that they didn't include both the theatrical and extended cut on one DVD/Blu Ray set. The Blu Ray looks and sounds very good, but which version to buy?Since I found both in the $5.00 bargin bin I bought both, but is it worth it? That depends on how much you want to own this film. If I were going with one I would go with the extended version, but there are more extras on the theatrical. It's bad enough they make mediocre films, but to try to make more money from fans by releasing two versions separately is just ridiculous and greedy. The Blu Ray version does have some extra stuff not on the DVD. My rating is 2 1/2 stars for the film with a 1/2 star deducted for the cheap trick they pulled with the two separate releases.",1.0,245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052740613934384374,0.20321543237196868,0.14060966128263186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741966335231796,0.0,0.2854386843863099,0.05465524422369933,0.0,0.0,0.07021203332704894,0.1347901521274523,0.0,0.16272882129042537,0.0,0.11872975958128926,0.15909608268378522,0.129689016953069,0.053114610786168547,0.1096934930001823,0.0,0.0,0.09298883521597305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969418052697689,0.05422370638859872,0.10668412056447032,0.0,0.2616695077137492,0.19088180633623705,0.0,0.1118702409705535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530687625932337,0.1150619820172891,0.0,0.08469160999672579,0.0,0.06485928928769284,0.05645044652829345,0.0,0.09171867021819832,0.03169554808174888,0.17507173931449457,0.14022518469825734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06309763924622247,0.06237851948967881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05864371323843125,0.06128639437999991,0.06494816033716866,0.07814332928045727,0.4956119359789232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055683982521456975,0.21990097735944053,0.061448358922056134,0.0,0.15840051566569885,0.07063801155401556,0.28963747013599067,0.0,0.057946602330885624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06733780070248938,0.05729582301725678,0.0,0.06532946988240164,0.0,0.0,0.16670927188068904,0.06230507871779055,0.04572948242368234,

It was a big improvement over the cheap Sterling/UAV Gadget DVDs ""The Gadget Files"" and ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas."" The first 22 episodes are there, including the original pilot, with Gadget's mustache! Like I did with the Sterling DVDs, it's time to give it my ""Gadget Factors...""PROSThe original episodes are there, of course.There is some cool special features, such as the interview with the show's creators and the original art gallery!The pilot has its original dialogue (since reruns of this episode had badly-recorded voiceovers explaining Gadget's mustache was a fake.) Plus, the pilot episode has its original opening and closing titles, featuring Gadget's mustache throughout them!CONSThere's some noticable DVNR on some episodes.A few episodes like ""Monster Lake,"" ""Down on the Farm,"" ""The Boat"" and ""The Haunted Castle"" are time-compressed.And of course, like the other Gadget DVDs, there's the following edits...EDITSThe title of an episode is electronically added at the start of most episodes during the beginning of the first scene. When these cartoons originally aired, including their Nickelodeon reruns, they had no episode titles! This probably wasn't really needed.The original DiC logo featuring Inspector Gadget dotting the ""i"" was cut. It was replaced with the ""Incredible World of DiC"" logo on most episodes, though two of the episodes have the famous 1990s ""Kid in Bed"" DiC logo tacked onto it. This was somewhat unnecessary. However, the original late-70s/early-80s LBS logo is intact on all episodes, which you might remember if you saw this show on Nickelodeon back in the 90s.I have been waiting for quite some time ever since I got my ""Gadget Files"" DVD for a company to release a box set of Gadget episodes, and it's finally happened!All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend it to those who are big fans of the show, or those who are dying to see this classic cartoon again!",0.9523809523809523,323,0.0,0.0,0.12181264177026348,0.0,0.04403288359167232,0.14542592743961452,0.1956572106784569,0.0737136046431342,0.043658381212792655,0.0,0.0,0.05628835098271227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11253564634867554,0.0,0.0,0.10889822811758154,0.06608460150545364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835082016171502,0.09384965746011782,0.07763592895380912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04527111031147036,0.08907005647942673,0.0,0.0819249775916375,0.18592734680841377,0.12241001555660531,0.0,0.13326603687865182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497258974024238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426040977720684,0.054361631848964136,0.0,0.29108705842402166,0.18270818592995405,0.0,0.0,0.048576233953777546,0.05563475347409648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052679913951985353,0.052079524343935785,0.0,0.0,0.18966167533992256,0.0,0.19584541064492617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5976880133481648,0.055149697819499424,0.05808998392514258,0.0,0.1859611511795081,0.04589856571355932,0.15390881334907122,0.14882919809791562,0.10579825977522533,0.0,0.060454230880548306,0.0,0.0,0.21249860257347475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04939296713288142,0.05454325856002252,0.09259917950968859,0.0,0.13918476511304034,0.0,0.07635864757943811,
774712,B0000CABE3,A2YS8G30VYUN6C,1,1,1060041600,"Good, But I Expected Something a Little Different","OK, first let me say that like most other red blooded males, I think Angelina Jolie is absolutely gorgeous.  So I&#65533;ll pay to see her in any Tomb Raider movie she does.  That being said, I did expect a little more from this one.  The basic plot has Lara Croft searching for Pandora&#65533;s Box.  As the movie opens, Croft finds an orb that represents the map to the box&#65533;s location, the so called cradle of life.  As we would expect, the map has to be deciphered first.  There are also a host of baddies who want to obtain the box and unleash a deadly plague.  The orb is stolen from Croft by a band of mercenaries soon after she discovers it. MI-6, realizing the danger of the orb and the man who has paid to have it stolen, convince Croft to retrieve it.  She agrees with the proviso that she is allowed to spring a former lover turned mercenary from prison, in exchange for his help.  So the journey begins that will lead Lara Croft across the globe in a battle to retrieve the orb and protect its secrets.The movie features several action sequences with some very impressive &#65533;James Bond-like&#65533; stunts.  Jolie plays Lara Croft with a harder edge as compared to the first.  Despite all of the action though, the movie is hurt by the fact that the story seems to drag in several places.  I think a little too much time was spent on retrieving the orb.  Additionally, the &#65533;love interest&#65533; story line didn&#65533;t seem to work all that well.  The last 30 minutes or so of the movie were quite good and featured some pretty cool CGI monsters that guard the cradle of life.  Along with the opening sequence, this was more of what I expected from the movie.  Despite the minor flaws, the movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable.  It&#65533;s worth seeing on the big screen and the DVD will be a sure buy for me when it becomes available.  3 stars for the movie and 1 star because Angelina Jolie is in it.",1.0,348,0.0,0.051797844402406194,0.06980172663192571,0.047888725441575394,0.037847935057652146,0.14583228964106956,0.033634960053899834,0.09503946234603726,0.0,0.07123320749349885,0.05059794275561481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844383975174277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04836433010125535,0.0,0.0,0.14040324171957377,0.11360444749806309,0.15222824198530496,0.0,0.03811632420791316,0.0,0.0,0.12100101507110508,0.033365514105689616,0.0,0.05011126584141864,0.0,0.040314995073723194,0.0,0.0,0.12759849148483168,0.0,0.14083525667959293,0.13698138248616812,0.05260802769760907,0.0,0.07636481189750051,0.04741439916366867,0.0,0.09373157523559067,0.08257125008846239,0.04941165278035239,0.2431069580700736,0.0,0.04654458842477875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18196391068290288,0.0628178487668807,0.033542990167626505,0.0,0.041753117172085366,0.0478201826608131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04476432825706374,0.0,0.21311090912531064,0.0,0.15030859504117336,0.0841682826426366,0.08796118593908321,0.0,0.22431014212121508,0.6520489512778852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03996016726019822,0.0,0.04409682262657618,0.04264144857835043,0.2500784568499679,0.05069153872998557,0.0,0.0,0.04158387774096649,0.060883538649766145,0.0,0.0,0.04975800869981946,0.0433936123498141,0.048323227922293426,0.0411168628285172,0.04245513034498598,0.0,0.07959251011072524,0.08785117730560586,0.1196345894550771,0.04471162539000063,0.0,

Yes, he's really sick. But aren't they all? Carol Kane is fine as the terrorized baby sitter trying to start a new life years later with children of her own but by then the thrill is gone. Charles Durning turns in another rubber-stamped weary cop turn and Colleen Dewhurst is wasted as a barfly who has a close encounter with the killer. And she has a VERY long walk home that makes you wonder why she didn't just call a cab. British actor Tony Beckham is OK as the killer, but how much sympathy are we supposed to give this guy?  Not as much as the film tries to get us to that's for sure. This was followed by a TV sequel years later that's even worse. I can't recommend either one. If you really want to see either---just rent'em.",1.0,169,0.0,0.11845070490315943,0.07981088613240782,0.0,0.0,0.14292324630976316,0.07691603335502839,0.36222521864836654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20075160099163145,0.17938445549430576,0.09531422409909313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055140795803894,0.08901561480217325,0.0,0.1298946610764215,0.0,0.10641336444541204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18446913759348654,0.0,0.09490139458737507,0.11459385677118868,0.0,0.0,0.11437193998972674,0.08898405069411587,0.11671629532333198,0.0,0.21470694545144992,0.0,0.0,0.18358514857589664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128752411205115,0.0,0.0,0.0752576625968999,0.1040282358078406,0.0,0.07670571769450962,0.0,0.09548054012664624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20709331409870058,0.10236654242544703,0.0,0.24366976753258057,0.0,0.08593098439248685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19235617879750666,0.3162934976138987,0.0,0.0,0.11715022846812397,0.0,0.09021736533834791,0.1512601475322658,0.0,0.259943859517031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09509352537449355,0.06961388213414285,0.0,0.0,0.11378603247044317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100561071986708,0.0,0.13678949013460956,0.0,0.15008913455832057,

It contains seven complete Hullabaloo shows (six half-hour shows and a one-hour special), plus eighteen bonus songs.  Details are given at the end  of the review.Each show is fronted by a different guest host, who - as  well as introducing the acts - also performs one or two songs of his own.  Featured throughout are the Hullabaloo Dancers, who twitch their bodies and  shake their mop-tops in time to the music.  The shows themselves are made  up of three separate elements.Firstly there are guest acts performing  their latest recordings.  Although a few are clearly miming, most do  actually sing their numbers live.In the middle of the show comes the  medley.  In many ways the medleys are the most interesting to watch - since  it gives us a chance to see our Sixties heroes performing numbers not  associated with them.  Some struggle in the attempt, others are plainly  nervous - but they all make it through to the end.  It is this element of  uncertainty that makes the medley fascinating to watch more than thirty  years on.The show ends with a visit to the Hullabaloo A-Go-Go, where a  live act performs to an audience of that week's guests - complete with  Go-Go dancers in cages.  My only disappointment with this section is that  the cameras focus mainly on the dancers - providing only brief glimpses of  the performers.  And, with performers like The Yardbirds, that today feels  like an opportunity missed.Hullabaloo was broadcast from January 1965  to August 1966, and - for the first three months - included a segment from  London hosted by Brian Epstein.  Many of the bonus songs on these tapes  come from these London segments, and feature Brian's somewhat shy  introductions.Here are the details:Volume One: April 11, 1966 (in  colour); Paul Anka (host) - What now my love; The Cyrkle - Red rubber ball;  Lesley Gore - Young love; Peter &amp; Gordon - Woman; Wrong from the start;  plus Academy Award Song Medley, including What's new pussycat by The  CyrkleDecember 6, 1965; Frankie Avalon (host) - Do I hear a waltz?; The  Hollies - Look through any window; Nancy Sinatra - So long babe; Lola  Falana - Loverly; The Yardbirds - I'm a man; plus TV Theme Song  MedleyBonus Songs; Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers - I'll be there; It's  gonna be alright; The Bobby Fuller Four - I fought the law; The Vogues -  Five o'clock world; Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles - Going to a  Go-GoVolume Two; November 29, 1965 (in colour); Michael Landon (host) -  I like it like that; The Byrds - The times they are a-changin'; Jackie  DeShannon - A lifetime of loneliness; Chad &amp; Jill - The cruel war; Paul  Revere &amp; The Raiders - Steppin' out; plus, Top Pop Medley, including Do  you believe in magic by The ByrdsMarch 14, 1966; Gary Lewis (host) &amp;  The Playboys - Run for your life; The Mamas &amp; The Papas - California  dreamin'; Dionne Warwick - Message to Michael; Bobby Rydell - The joker;  Noel Harrison - (It's all over now) Baby Blue; plus, Top Pop Medley,  including Nowhere man by the Mamas &amp; PapasBonus Songs: The Moody  Blues - Go now; The Marvelettes - Don't mess with Bill; The Turtles - You  baby; The Animals - I'm crying;Volume Three; September 20, 1965 (in  colour); Jerry Lewis &amp; Gary Lewis (host) - Help; Gary Lewis &amp; The  Playboys - Everybody loves a clown; Barry McGuire - Eve of destruction;  Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders - Ooh poo pah doo;Joannie Sommers - Before  and after; plus Top Pop Medley, including It ain't me babe by Gary Lewis  &amp; The PlayboysSeptember 13, 1965; Sammy Davis Jr (host) - I know a  place; The Lovin' Spoonful - Do you believe in magic; The Supremes -  Nothing but heartaches; Sonny &amp; Cher - I got you babe; The Strangeloves  - I want Candy; Sammy Davis Jr &amp; The Supremes - Toot-toot-tootsie;  plus, Top Pop Medley, including (I can't get no) Satisfaction by Sonny  &amp; CherBonus Songs: The Searchers - Love potion #9; What have they  done to the rain; Marvin Gaye - Ain't that peculiar; Dusty Springfield -  Some of your lovin'; The Young Rascals - Good lovin';Volume Four; May 4,  1965; Trini Lopez (host) - What'd I say; Sad tomorrows; I've lost my love  for you; Sir Douglas Quintet - She's about a mover; Herman's Hermits - Mrs  Brown you've got a lovely daughter; Silhouettes; Can't you hear my  heartbeat; Chuck Berry - Johnny B Goode; The Four Seasons - medley: Dawn  (go away), Rag doll, Toy soldier, Bye bye baby; Vikki Carr - There goes my  heart; Martha &amp; The Vandellas - Nowhere to run; Freddie &amp; The  Dreamers - You were made for me; The Travellers Three - San Francisco Bay  blues; Trini Lopez &amp; Chuck Berry - Memphis; Trini Lopez &amp; Vikki  Carr - If I had a hammer; Entire cast - Do the Freddie; plus, Top Pop  Medley, including Do you wanna dance by The Four SeasonsBonus Songs:  Wayne Fontana &amp; The Mindbenders - Game of love; The Four Tops -  Something about you; Gene Pitney - Town without pity; Johnny Rivers -  Midnight Special",0.9765625,875,0.07316605322867761,0.030706650774201177,0.04137966102356246,0.028389257991742776,0.04487381039686596,0.07410161409401583,0.17945443206864378,0.0375606824788001,0.022246077941934617,0.04222826743592191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0346946538311814,0.18601141575939945,0.04941769819972995,0.17370109229343622,0.029869594189937298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027744483454787867,0.06734666540596516,0.09024351338443354,0.02758614245820252,0.022596010891029458,0.0,0.027605017907578418,0.023910492518099697,0.019779649160409862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02389942069934772,0.0,0.023067842199604748,0.15128514950933358,0.0,0.04174477812202502,0.10827321800994089,0.0,0.0,0.0905407411226241,0.14054034618472624,0.06096968145483045,0.05556568580180809,0.024474826797404915,0.05858415088917812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12007570851756663,0.02769990699537105,0.01950947244539385,0.17529090786268214,0.05585924762097583,0.05965458004379371,0.05498454071094265,0.02475196415080875,0.0,0.024134413994723772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026537061740498,0.0,0.03158395073280042,0.09664188856762994,0.022276378435912923,0.04989640189064779,0.0,0.02763023801942566,0.09973117528382545,0.7613780997225403,0.112405860417677,0.029599684508361757,0.0,0.07106721805283699,0.07016268413458669,0.03921202942713384,0.05055716449623679,0.16172814481662903,0.0,0.061608767651436344,0.025508189168039392,0.0,0.018046403096352623,0.05728672450973461,0.0,0.0,0.025724477835508283,0.02864683851637389,0.09749912664298911,0.0,0.0,0.04718380543454783,0.0,0.10638215551132084,0.0,0.1945423053266064,

1138317,B0012Q3SZ0,A42GFMF12V7XR,3,3,1262217600,Poor 1980's transfers cut by 4 minutes for syndication.,"Sadly I must add to the complaints about SHOUT using the old, poorly transfered, 1980's filmchain transfers that Columbia Pictures Television made for syndicating the shows. Columbia hacked off 4 minutes as well as the original Screen Gems logo at the end.Then the old reel-to-reel 1"" video tapes were copied & sent over to SFM who was going to synduicate the shows for FREE to TV stations in exchange for commercial time (called barter in the industry).  Now SFM replaced the Columbia Television logo with their tacky computer graphic SFM logo, replacing the original music as well.Now that Sony owns Columbia Pictures, they retrieved the old edited 1"" reel-to-reel video tapes from SFM & converted them over to more modern Beta SP cartridge tape, complete with all of the 20 year old video tape glitches.  Now they tagger their new Sony Television logo to the end, often after the SFM logo.With the copyright owners not interested in releasing this show to home video, SHOUT Factory contracted the rights to do so.  Unfortunetaly SHOUT does not own the show & releases only what they are given & Sony gave them the 3rd generation dubs of the 20+ year old video tape film transfers.  SHOUT also removed all evidence of the previous TV syndicators logos (abruptly cutting the end credits) in hopes that we would not notice they are the cut syndication versions.Based on the very good bonus material in this DVD, some effort was put into this release. But nobody wanted to invest the money to re-master the original fim negatives for this release, or the posterity of preserving the show.It would have been nice if Sony had accessed Columbia's oroginal transfers before the edits were made, but it is possible they were erased.",1.0,293,0.05109676159219911,0.06433354040570127,0.08669457682015246,0.05947836804247416,0.0,0.0,0.08355004292692901,0.1180401455217871,0.04660778424419561,0.0,0.0,0.060090989294286655,0.0,0.07268881033373437,0.0,0.0,0.06065356069899017,0.0,0.06006907470109408,0.0,0.048346606770266726,0.0,0.14109807845680353,0.047267322943826746,0.0,0.047340929180301555,0.0,0.05783530571329473,0.0,0.04144036638280772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04832946351373026,0.15847884795886638,0.06073618935845182,0.02915317802852755,0.056710836822605595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051277238611000905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12262295648154863,0.11300067343877875,0.03901025861662709,0.0,0.057599088183338004,0.05185786940835618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202474535199798,0.046671266845017184,0.052269005348965905,0.0,0.0,0.10447345172891087,0.6871476375067679,0.11775082564676682,0.12402866814212105,0.06362721912759307,0.0,0.2449965377173416,0.10953755906020278,0.05296118760775122,0.33883682775463425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051647672016828856,0.07561808100232167,0.0,0.0,0.061800040139283634,0.10779076796201274,0.18005407591411435,0.051067633926696956,0.0,0.0,0.04942742332499136,0.0,0.11144069000490331,0.11106474378685005,0.0,

853711,B0002ZMITY,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,22,29,1096243200,"Worth a watch if you like Ali G, but not much else","Ali G is, in my opinion, one of the best icons of British comedy to come out in the past 10 years. Taking the Mickey out of wannabe ghetto kids, white guys who pretend to be black and ignorant meatheaded idiots all at once whilst winding people up who think his politically incorrect and often stupid comments are serious, he has often reduced me to a fit of laughter on the living room floor. However, this full length film severely misses the mark.First off, the humour lacks any subtlty. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't really a gangster. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't well-endowed and that he didn't really get loads of girls. We didn't need to know that he lived with his mum. We knew he was stupid. Having it all spelt out ruins the image.Secondly, due to the lack of real life situations, there is no opportunity for Sacha Baron Cohen to utilise his quick wit and annoy people. Every joke is pre-planned for the film and rather than being an extension of the hilarious TV show, the film simply takes his character and puts it into a ridiculously unrealistic situation that, although may raise a smile, certainly won't make you laugh out loud.If this is all you've seen of Ali G then do yourself a favour and find some episodes of The 11 O'Clock Show or Da Ali G Show (the latter can be found on his Ali G Aiiiiii video). This film could be worth a watch if you like Ali G, but be warned: the quick wit and comedy genius is replaced with purile humour not much better than The Bloodhound Gang.

1037587,B000LAZDQA,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,11,26,1174089600,Long Ride on a Short Bus,"I purchased this DVD sight unseen because so many people told me I had to see it.  Nay, so many people insisted that I simply HAD to own it.  It was, they implied, the most revolutionary film ever released, and the next logical step in the Progression of Cinema - the Cinema of the Future.  I'm sorry, but in the end, I was completely disappointed.Not that it didn't seem to have several things going for it, at least initially.  To begin with, the film opens with the most candid and realistic depiction of sex I have ever seen in a non-pornographic film, and for a few minutes I thought I was viewing something genuinely revolutionary.  And, also initially, it seemed to have a few candid and profound things to say about troubled relationships, until I figured out half-way through it that the characters in those relationships weren't really very interesting, or (with one exception) very likable, either.This cinematic sex-fest was immediately different from pornography in that, not only did it appear that the characters were really having sex, they seemed to be doing so in a perfectly natural manner.  That is, the opening sequence seemed inhabited by real people, none of them extremely attractive (well, not to me), engaging in sex acts that appeared quite convincing.  As anyone knows, the point of pornography is sexual titillation.  Despite claims of ""redeeming social value"", all pornographic films exist so that the viewer may achieve prurient satisfaction from watching fantasy sex scenes with beautiful people.  The sex in Shortbus is anything but arousing; the participants not only appear to be really having sex with each other (and I believe they actually were), the sex seemed downright mundane.  So I was immediately struck by the believability of the opening scene, including the act involving a dominatrix prostitute, and one character's self-filmed auto-fellatio.  Believe it or not, that's where reality ended, and surrealism began to seep in.The basic plot concerns a sex therapist named Sofia, played by the amazingly talented Sook-Yin Lee.  Ms. Lee was easily the most engaging thing about Shortbus, and her performance alone was the most enjoyable aspect of the film; she also presented the most likable character.  In the film, Sofia remarks several times that she does not want to be referred to as a sex therapist, but she prefers to be called a relationship counselor.  I kept thinking that neither her character nor the film's creators seemed to be aware that a sex therapist and a relationship counselor are not the same thing.  Anyway, Sofia is having her first session with a gay couple, James and Jamie, one of whom is a former child star and the other a former prostitute, when she inadvertently blurts out to them that she has never achieved an orgasm, despite her ""perfect"" relationship with her husband, Rob (who may or may not be gay himself).  In a sort of bizarre role reversal, James and Jamie suggest to Sofia that she try Shortbus.  What is Shortbus, exactly?  I spent the rest of the film trying to figure that out.Shortbus appears to be some sort of combination sexual workshop / voyeur's retreat / cabaret, where those who are sexually confused, no longer attracted to their partners, or otherwise sexually hung up / inhibited / you-pretty-much-name-it can go to work out their sexual problems through uninhibited sexual play with a variety of partners and fellow sufferers.  The biggest problem I had was that virtually all of the patrons of Shortbus seemed totally immersed in their own shallow worlds, endlessly crying about their sexual problems until working them out through hours of joyous, uninhibited sex.  At one early point, one character remarks how hot the gay couple is.  Aside from their youth, I didn't get what was supposed to be so hot about them, as I am generally neither into twinks nor vapid, shallow people.  I didn't find much attractive about the rest of the cast, either.The film takes place in New York City.  I am a gay man who has lived all my life in New York City, and I have never met people who even vaguely resemble the characters in Shortbus, nor would I want to.  I can imagine (in fact, in the wild 1970's, I have even been to) places in NYC that resemble Shortbus (if for nothing else, the wild sexual orgies reflected therein) but such places, few and far between (and now largely extinct) would have been organized and run by the Mafia purely for profit, and patronized solely by the sexually compulsive, for no other reason than the sex itself.  One would certainly not expect to find such a place filled with whole rooms of the sexually repressed, working their way to sexual health through a sort of sexual group therapy.  And the first thing I noticed about the mythical Shortbus club (if one could call it a club - I still don't know what to call it) is that it seemed to be operated entirely on someone's charity.  I never saw anyone collect an entrance fee, or discuss ""terms of membership"".  I kept wondering how such a multi-roomed sex orgy / cabaret / sex therapy ""establishment"" could exist on the Island of Manhattan virtually for free, where a hamburger and a beer is likely to set you back $[...] these days, and even then you are hustled out the door of most restaurants in less than an hour.  I got the impression that some of the inhabitants of Shortbus had been there for days, a prospect that seemed to me to be possible for the super-rich only.As I say, there were some aspects of the film I thought were genuinely worthwhile, mostly the comedic moments, and a few of those were genuinely funny (especially the appearance of a character clearly based on former mayor Ed Koch).  The celebrated ""Star Spangled Banner scene"" struck me as puerile and tasteless, and I have never been accused of being a prude.  I sure didn't enjoy it for the drama, which was strained throughout, and bordered on bad soap opera.  Soap opera with sex.  I have nothing against sex, but the soap opera-lives of the main characters were boring as could be.  At one point, I glanced at the digital readout on my DVD player, and sighed as I realized I needed to sit through this movie for another hour, never a good sign.  At the film's climax, everyone's self-absorbed problems seemed to be magically solved, and the whole cast gathered together for a good natured sing along.  As the credits started to roll, I realized with a jolt that the few minutes of entertainment I managed to glean from the proceedings were not worth the amount of time I had wasted watching the film as a whole, and I rolled my eyes as I yanked the disc from the machine and filed it on my shelf, probably never to be watched again.  Revolutionary?  Perhaps, but the lapses in logic, the extreme surrealism (especially for a film touted for its realism) and the shallowness of its main characters all contributed to my ultimate  dissatisfaction.I have heard nothing but great things about the director's earlier work, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but after reading various reviews, I decided it probably wasn't for me.  Now I guess I'll never know, because there is no way I intend to subject myself to another film by John Cameron Mitchell.  And I expect to be very, very cautious in the future when someone tells me about a film I simply MUST own.",0.4230769230769231,1262,0.11817797301213118,0.01859904415889766,0.05012739085853468,0.034390794809206815,0.04077015695817234,0.24685875434711138,0.0362319000651028,0.113752684589176,0.06737234044944206,0.17904387932077184,0.03633639131196508,0.06949003312351443,0.0,0.08405832383725315,0.08450045304211812,0.02993234129656608,0.0,0.01809203828291655,0.034732345395707825,0.049703233774054806,0.195680345899743,0.03360971385228053,0.14277176126038219,0.06832571479520202,0.016708949651546547,0.027372845542001145,0.014132754605623882,0.08360191263541802,0.028965210792624933,0.10782495095230156,0.0,0.08996722324988388,0.0,0.0,0.035917198874364516,0.02794442278162086,0.1924304383991787,0.01755903780201263,0.08428282387467316,0.1311623581354409,0.03777991310444916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03692938725460251,0.10096854764918398,0.0,0.1064534081634333,0.010911547335236546,0.0,0.03342551665837132,0.07272995747896716,0.05033357078171938,0.1181690384265351,0.2613510156001631,0.06766798638021478,0.09635421126832444,0.049956273720288165,0.0749614273542211,0.05151235727603168,0.08770940893640897,0.11395609859867956,0.0,0.04877646397819948,0.016073520579899706,0.0,0.114782552883041,0.0,0.08095692674720988,0.045333438786197534,0.0,0.033471316740014585,0.21142539815458283,0.5250212957166955,0.10212648606651803,0.0717142150485516,0.018394844288051763,0.043045473651110354,0.042497596697271656,0.023750759151108667,0.015311258494595996,0.3183663376453932,0.0,0.0,0.015450331598797482,0.0597260667755903,0.10930721509371827,0.0,0.05508801877154275,0.0,0.015581337826305134,0.12145989901267448,0.04429147715965983,0.030488714469417935,0.016833913135794555,0.05715854114570528,0.0,0.11813222836129879,0.04816378970817255,0.03535033130916994,

Just some thoughts on this Kevin Costner movie...Field Of Dreams (1989) stars Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan, Burt Lancaster, Ray Liotta, and Frank Whaley.  It's a good baseball fantasy movie.  The 1919 Black Sox are featured in this movie, which I think is cool.  I'm a fan of the Deadball Era in general, so seeing players from the 1900s and 1910s was neat.  The acting in this movie is OK.  The best acting comes from Ray Liotta in his role as ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson.  I thought Amy Madigan was a little over the top, bordering on camp.  This is one of those movies that requires the viewer to really, I mean REALLY suspend disbelief.  I found it rather strange that Costner and Madigan's characters had virtually no reaction when Joe Jackson suddenly appeared.While I think The Natural (1984) is not only the best baseball fantasy movie ever, but the best baseball movie ever, Field Of Dreams is good as well.  But it's not in the same league (no pun intended) as The Natural.  Still, a solid baseball movie.",1.0,191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194606836253618,0.06428934525058541,0.18165696636485135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283620500148762,0.11186388084771594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05428544835121756,0.14548336002480564,0.0,0.14570991151818852,0.0,0.08900519512424448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07705746143051324,0.0,0.0,0.24388979381502482,0.0,0.22432528599260634,0.13091205367039946,0.0,0.07672372381189782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40658703751240544,0.09537516429659645,0.0,0.0,0.17862228057961796,0.12580643182967427,0.21737688736461452,0.12006906982500798,0.06411355542470756,0.08864166998875389,0.0,0.09140276153444148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17309646621693464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07182438410248691,0.08043898035392376,0.0,0.0,0.107185738788819,0.4909731017455865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685719768806493,0.0,0.04345419232196419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11637185922206394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08294188313459304,0.0,0.0,0.08114808306695,0.08960953620104249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1352534,B003L77GLU,A2RJT770ZA4WQM,16,18,1289606400,The fun continues...,"After the insanely funny, original and stylishly quirky Season One, I seriously doubted that the creator of ""Bored to Death"", the real Jonathan Ames, would be able to match, much less surpass, what I so admired about his HBO series.  But I'm happy to say that the adventures of Jonathan (Jason Schwartzman), George (Ted Danson), and Ray (Zach Galifianakos) continue in high hilarity and unmatched style.As the season opens we find Jonathan, as usual, down on his luck.  His second novel has been rejected and he has to pay back his advance to his publisher (we don't see Bebe Neuwirth this season, worse luck).  To help make ends meet, he is teaching a night class in writing at a Brooklyn public high school.  The class, in Ames' gifted hands, offers all kinds of opportunities for fun, from a dark, angry Asian writer to a Lolita-like student who has an immediate crush on Jonathan.  Jonathan is a bit ashamed of this venue, but as always, aspires earnestly to please.Ames explores some of society's taboos this season, played out in Jonathan's now full-time occupation as an unlicensed private detective.  S and M, adultery (of course), transgenderism, menage a trois, all are explored with Ames' usual witty, sometimes uproarious, but always somehow endearingly earnest, goofiness.  He borrows from older movies (""Chinatown"" and ""On the Waterfront"", even ""Casablanca"") and once again I am reminded of Woody Allen, but Ames puts his own stamp of genius on these monoliths, and makes them his own.Some old friends re-appear -- Oliver Platt and Kristen Wiig among them -- and some new ones enhance the episodes (Kevin Bacon, F. Murray Abraham, Mary Kay Place).  But always it is the magical chemistry of Schwartzman, Danson, and Galifianakos that make it work.  ""The Onion"", in reviewing the series, said Ted Danson hasn't seemed to have this much fun since ""Body Heat"". That may be true, but how lucky for us!  And I have to put a plug in here for Jason Schwartzman.  He is absolutely the center of the show, so funny, so literate, so horny, yet somehow so innocent and just plain nice.  I love this character.  The series has been renewed for a third season, and I await it eagerly.",0.8888888888888888,372,0.048617607835860686,0.061212153973655974,0.08248825964699791,0.0,0.08945366955178982,0.3446749057157779,0.03974814738857054,0.14975063846296185,0.04434643029957989,0.08417991357429697,0.0,0.11435089273542341,0.0,0.20748610859520383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05954352404402288,0.0,0.05452685225422506,0.0,0.0,0.13425216845549884,0.08994793794073971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19065742602362248,0.07885945874430202,0.1961700027888019,0.0,0.0,0.3334959977696876,0.059104357434095416,0.0,0.18094757257225752,0.0,0.11095480280115202,0.08093894227650596,0.0,0.04743594557369558,0.04512209608303634,0.05603201321713781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05896756411025552,0.11000822702829123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26879503980509795,0.14847011011267147,0.039639461884290336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04811073263483979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05290028929604213,0.1973156041404152,0.0,0.06421690430961217,0.22203416400270123,0.1491989271829601,0.0,0.0,0.1325393664136595,0.3269040280112633,0.0,0.11801094551280407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302786596386619,0.05039157413115184,0.2686640584582707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11760315221976203,0.0,0.0,0.04858989340984951,0.0,0.0,0.04702926386470593,0.0,0.035344573672833744,0.052838007630641975,0.0,

He has become too much of an action hero in the Rambo sense for my liking. I didn't like the story of this one, and the evil villan was very weak in terms of portrayal. We get an impression of how frightening and powerful this villan is through what other characters say and do, but when we see him ourselves, he is rather disappointing! It is not all the fault of the actor, even though he does not have the physical stature to carry off such a role. This is made even more acute by the fact that there is a great build up where we are told that he is just getting stronger and stronger until the day he dies, but it isn't really followed up with the dramatic ending that it could have been. Very run'o the mill, in fact. Also, he bore too much of a resemblence to Blofeld to be convincing in his own right. Somehing went wrong with this Bond movie.

653597,B00005JPNO,A36NMMVWY6BP1V,0,0,1399507200,Cool! But Kids Be Warned!,"One of my several nerdy obsessions has always been the Transformers franchise. For some reason, I've always loved the idea of giant robots that turn into vehicles fighting each other over whatever. When I heard that they were coming out with a new theatrical film, I knew that I wanted to see it. Unfortunately, due to it's content, I was not able to in theaters.Eventually, my family got a DVD player that cuts out immoral content (such as language, sexuality, etc.) called ClearPlay. This player allowed me to finally see this film. Once I did, I was pleasantly surprised.The film's premise is very similar to what we see in most Transformers incarnations. The alien robots' planet has died, so they relocate to earth, where they continue to rage their war. In this movie, they are fighting over a giant cube called the ""Allspark"", which can give (or take) life to robots. It's plot isn't very complicated (or important for that matter), but it gets the job done.What makes the movie are the action scenes and high-budget special effects. Seeing massive robots blow each other up is really cool, especially with the modern Spielberg effects. The action scenes are very thought out and are some of the most impressive scenes in film today (although they are beaten by its sequels'). Between the currently three films in the series, this one has the best blend of action and story, whereas the other two are more about the action than anything. In this case, however, it is a good thing. It's hard for me to watch an action movie when there isn't any real good plot to back up the fighting.There are some negatives to the movie. The human characters aren't particularly interesting, and some of the acting isn't very good. Also, despite it referencing the series many times, the mature themes in the movie don't fit too well with the rest of the film. This is especially true considering that, similar to the G.I. Joe films (though not as bad), the dialogue is at times very similar to a Saturday morning cartoon.What I should warn parents though is that, despite this film being based on a toy, this film is not appropriate for all audiences. The film has a lot of language and unnecessary sexual content. Micheal Bay really pulled out all the stops to make sure that this movie was designed for teenagers (particularly guys). It's a lot worse than movies such as Captain America or Thor, where the content barely makes the PG-13 mark. I would recommend using the ClearPlay DVD player I mentioned earlier (although it doesn't cut out Megan Fox's bad clothing). If you want your kids to watch a cleaner version of Transformers, check out the TV show Transformers: Prime (it's better than the movies anyway).In the end, Transformers is a really enjoyable action flick. The dialogue isn't great and the story isn't anything spectacular, but the action scenes and special effects make it all worth it. Top that off with Transformers legend Peter Cullen returning to voice Optimus Prime, and you've got an enjoyable film that is sure to please most Transformers fans. Well... most, anyway.Final Score: 8.4/10",0.0,532,0.030212122268561962,0.0,0.07689021006308426,0.035167937686056784,0.05558860919267128,0.12239375647660114,0.17290302004052502,0.06979392035771469,0.027557912328975656,0.0,0.0,0.03553016393263959,0.03632301583825197,0.04297891210574032,0.028803314797028353,0.030608734673198395,0.0,0.03700174296506976,0.07103441286212167,0.0,0.25727427620633053,0.0,0.1042843094494394,0.0,0.0,0.08397420283407714,0.028904236500509998,0.0,0.11847899810048351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028575894349315095,0.14992675644618825,0.035911653142891575,0.1551373152627635,0.20118943149993318,0.038633641275607145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037763895744754215,0.06883345018490339,0.03031883341010597,0.14514530590834132,0.13389744047718036,0.073287655895905,0.0,0.05949877289477785,0.0,0.07250361155409686,0.13362843577481967,0.02306570252846892,0.04926578342362739,0.0,0.09198643371901488,0.10535280622594938,0.17938282875222938,0.0,0.0,0.09975737142732675,0.09862044304916165,0.08174436413945049,0.0,0.03990589111789852,0.027595447860351497,0.12362095218967191,0.06459586212356644,0.10268304538294425,0.20590768045428282,0.5513958336611949,0.03481142670113326,0.0,0.0,0.058690919800968785,0.14485977432316793,0.14572478870406141,0.0,0.2838220547216609,0.03722623349918541,0.038159738135999384,0.06319787628170327,0.15268930292612148,0.06706636500340218,0.07096543200891782,0.0,0.03654067910979165,0.06373374279726762,0.03548702231454561,0.09058469962184915,0.06235536087705775,0.034428631932265,0.0,0.0,0.08785578960931163,0.03283477772813593,0.048198876300450486,

But it's Cynthia Stevenson as the bitter sister that elevates this film to near greatness.  The parents, brother, aunt, and eligible bachelor are familiar archetypes that are only occasionally funny.  This story has a lot of heart and the personality conflicts don't get fixed by some magic transformation.  They simply have to accept each others' flaws.

So I shall add only one small opinion to the others.  Simply this: Lettie wandering off into the desert would have been the better conclusion.  The author of the original book understood this, and wrote it into his novel.  Here's a poor dear that's had so much on her plate: loveless marriage, murder, distate from relatives, horrible weather, jealousy, culture shock, &amp;tc.  Such high drama would dent most anyone's armour.  The sweet tied-up ending might have allowed audiences to leave the theaters relieved and all in smiles, but it doesn't fit.  This is melodrama!  Pull out all the stops and do it correctly. Be that as it may, Miss Gish is outstanding in her role, a consummate tragedienne, as mentioned by another reviewer.  And so beautiful to look at, pure pleasure to watch on the screen.

While they keep Jack isolated from his friends, they force Sawyer and Kate to work for them, keeping them locked in cages at night.  But they soon tell Jack what they want from him.  Their leader Ben (Michael Emerson) has a tumor, and they want Jack to remove it.Meanwhile, back at the beach camp, the rest of the survivors of flight 815 are recovering from the explosion of the hatch.  Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) lost all his clothes when things went boom, but he seems to have gained a new power.  Hurly (Jorge Garcia) returns with news of the capture of Jack, Sawyer, and Kate, and various parties set out to rescue them.  But this season has plenty of surprises in store for the castaways.  What will they learn next?This season can pretty much be divided into two parts.  The first part was slow, with the story only moving forward at a snail's pace.  After it return from its hiatus, the pace improved dramatically.  I'm not sure that we got that many answers, but I at least feel that the story moved forward.  What these revelations mean to the show and the cast aways remains to be seen, but I am once again confident that the show will bring us resolution.And that leaves out the cliffhanger ending.  That had to be one of the best shocks of the season.  I never saw it coming, and it left my mouth hanging open.  Yes, it truly was a rattlesnake in a mailbox.This set will certainly wet your appetite for season 4 (and hopefully we'll get that sooner rather then later).

I can now see why there were quite a few negative reviews and low-star ratings.  There was not much to like about this movie.  Here is a breakdown for you of the good and bad:GOOD:- Decent looking sets, dark and dreary prison establishment was well done.- Seeing the real( human ) Bishop towards the end of the movie was kind of cool.- An interesting premise and start to the movie.  I really thought it might go somewhere and had my hopes up after a fairly cool beginning and initial concept.BAD:- Killing off Hicks and Newt...BAD....very bad.- CGI Alien looks absolutely awful. It was also acting like it was a half-dog (which in fact it WAS) which made it look even dumber.- Over the top, Friday the 13th style violence got silly really fast, almost laughable.- No characters that you liked.... I ENJOYED watching them get shredded up!- One Alien killing almost the entire prison population was a little far fetched. I mean c'mon... it was hard to believe. When one of the moron prisoners let the Alien out after they conveniently trapped it I almost shut it off....how DUMB can you be?  Again, laughable.- No plot, no real point. After everything Ripley had been through for goodness sakes you'd think someone would have rescued her or something or given her a break. The mean old company thing was getting old. I mean what the heck... isn't there someone on Earth that cares?  This was another hard to swallow issue.- The movie dragged at times and I was getting fidgety which means I'm bored.  I don't move much during good, captivating movies, I sit and get into them. It just seemed to be one pointless conversation after another, then a feeble attempt at killing the Alien, then a bunch of guys you could care less about get splattered. Lather, rinse, repeat... for over two hours.- Is everyone in space British?  I like our British friends and all but at times you could have sworn you were watching some BBC Sci-fi movie with the massive accents.- The Alien survived a hot-lead drowning which was WAY cheesey. We know from other Alien films that these critters are tough as nails but they have their limits. Not this one!Overall, I would skip this movie and just let the Alien ""Saga"" end at the 2nd film , Aliens. This one and Resurrection are both dogs and I suggest not wasting your time.",0.625,437,0.07947619676655517,0.20012951727857592,0.033711310811346915,0.04625649781510759,0.03655793527928621,0.26160044389927245,0.06497710857402458,0.030600053504743065,0.14498803117927372,0.06880531224006073,0.0,0.0467329351238064,0.0,0.05653029676241415,0.0,0.08051952782521905,0.0,0.04866850760195465,0.0,0.08913615934063275,0.03759929507211278,0.04520592396888144,0.08229928593357112,0.036759932937564126,0.13484378549621517,0.1104515301578216,0.0,0.13493605055468227,0.0,0.0966848762061562,0.0,0.09680657138114063,0.0,0.0,0.048309550287335905,0.0,0.04929978226110814,0.047234709068529473,0.0453450207247459,0.19846881373191358,0.0,0.1163167639885965,0.14752402458475747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04772751807027495,0.17611571989724073,0.09639548173356068,0.08991634807247163,0.039129460518523035,0.1353998777758905,0.09536422577230554,0.13182142288169085,0.030338390272883674,0.19439831447933584,0.0,0.080660028239873,0.04619029122975087,0.0393237987600996,0.0,0.0,0.08747412059741987,0.08647718364289421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03629637839597722,0.04064975572288272,0.0,0.0,0.08124930374996367,0.4007975198263271,0.04578757780784442,0.09645745177187408,0.09896614246225215,0.11579452402535391,0.07621380467963307,0.10648459322476313,0.04118806785542635,0.13175718751662516,0.0,0.10038324450357328,0.08312436322653827,0.040166543004270014,0.3528503938946695,0.0,0.049396528617250725,0.048062068879141724,0.0419145950605356,0.14002857245805486,0.03971544571408032,0.04100810004724043,0.1811363466312516,0.0,0.0,0.02888924832887565,0.08637537053207635,0.2218864616585781,

What a marvel. Who knew? Luckily a friend of mine has control over one tv guide that goes out to all parts of Iceland, so hopefully people will rely on his accurate account of the film which would state that this is the film, starring Sarandon and GEENA DAVIS, that launched Brad Pitt into stardom. This is the film that inspired many women to action, renewed friendships and made some women feel powerful. Although most women probably did not end their lives the way Thelma and Louise do in this film, women everywhere gathered some sense of togetherness from this film when two friends go on the run as events and circumstances around them escalate. Soon they are running from the law and feel that they have no alternatives although the detective on the case, played by Harvey Keitel, seems sympathetic and sincere in his desire to bring the twosome back peacefully. The film is witty, full of surprising events, and you will enjoy it although the end might not be the happiest one in film history.",0.25,216,0.0,0.0,0.051895118166008655,0.0,0.0,0.27879725869512617,0.10002561889108146,0.047105655469805253,0.0,0.05295937362283199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05832022400790045,0.0,0.07261408533530317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5209224537368751,0.0,0.0,0.11317632080490582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0599733204159256,0.049612162355664124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989109921278193,0.0,0.0,0.18972994259374548,0.07271300787934089,0.10470603866100958,0.03394693977580197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07646338189770736,0.0,0.0,0.07347163697928814,0.045185359033278846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06947809194926431,0.0978689871174822,0.16910467517216224,0.23351425831354097,0.0997521134438001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06053496984474507,0.07864981734510701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055874565554519987,0.1251522901891041,0.0,0.0,0.2501500011438938,0.41132455055271927,0.07048529718024525,0.0742431951950178,0.0,0.0,0.17598504646692958,0.1967065800264914,0.0,0.10141336321301939,0.0,0.07726487356947921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07604090816664492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061137870309515646,0.06312777956408452,0.13942044800915787,0.059174219845675655,0.13062849437343835,0.0,0.06648302828506641,0.04879593342953299,

Discs one and four (Fantasy Mission Force and Fire Dragon)are basically hacked up versions of the Fantasy Mission Force I had previously seen. The Fantasy Mission Force in this set is pretty shabby and lacking some of the elements that made the original strange enough to be worthwhile. Fire Dragon, with even poorer dubbing , picture quality and butchered editing is incredibly bizarre.....even missing over half of the Jackie scenes. It is nonsensical to the point of absurdity.....which is worth watching if you have the time and a little ""movie helper"" to get through.

571986,B000058TIM,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,28,29,993513600,Surprisingly good effort all around...,"I was so pleased to watch this DVD. Never having seen the film before, it was a real treat.Don't let the low budget or the Roger Corman and William Shatner names keep you from seeing this film.A black and white documentary-style telling about the early days of integration, &quot;The Intruder&quot; follows the efforts of Patrick Henry Society rabble-rouser Adam Cramer (Shatner), as he tries to convince a small Southern town to fight against court-ordered integration of local schools.Worming his way into the hearts of the townspeople, he soon finds that his racist views can lead to outcomes that cannot always be predicted or controlled.Written by Charles Beaumont, a big hand behind &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, every moment is filled with tension thanks in no small part to Shatner's presence.Shatner gives a wonderful performance as the racist villian. For those who consider his only contribution to entertainment to be Captain Kirk or T.J. Hooker, they have a pleasant surprise awaiting them.Here is a young Shatner, a daring Shatner, a Shatner with youthful energy, even at times a subtle Shatner, five years or so away from the role that made him a pop icon. His stage training serves him well in the role of Cramer, and his stage roots show. His speech on the town hall steps is frightening and mesmerizing and believable.Truly a very important work, both socially and culturally, every scene of &quot;The Intruder&quot; is a lesson for film students, history students, and anyone interested in the struggle of the Civil Rights Era. The film should be mandatory viewing in high school history classes.Included on the disc is a discussion between Shatner and Corman as they discuss the film, the dangers of shooting the film in the South at that time, how certain scenes were shot, and other behind-the-scenes reminiscences.",0.9655172413793104,299,0.045302535000085034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20646814582223835,0.0,0.10465473069691156,0.08264518968346661,0.11765994823970373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04319005348620129,0.04589724818119798,0.0,0.055483449353159596,0.05325741346951609,0.05080884771277159,0.2571854392055722,0.0,0.06254897999944836,0.0838146874791356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03674114738340106,0.09139691166326128,0.0,0.11849733610476902,0.2663622993021112,0.05507422805242681,0.0,0.140507799960571,0.05384887923314352,0.12923645519276036,0.025139995079770674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05145320612968553,0.0,0.20037344066340984,0.06917321377219819,0.0,0.05106751635698624,0.18390934146876028,0.052658213911425666,0.0,0.0,0.5122662563437795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059838167375595955,0.08275775739445262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12350194822656493,0.5004365145044717,0.0,0.05498208599172936,0.0,0.0,0.08688585248059234,0.04855815660836627,0.04695554043903468,0.17524132546511711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04579097375855053,0.06704320693720714,0.053205695693968505,0.05631341351521237,0.0,0.047783801616017085,0.0532121529286404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04382249491690477,0.0,0.06586908970439222,0.0,0.03613667489420396,

Series is the best Scooby Doo series of all time..even better than ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"".The animation is fantastic, bright, colorful,and clean. The various destinations that Mystery Inc visits are also beautiful and captures the culture of the particular country that they are in.Scooby and Shaggy are closer than ever, funnier than ever, hungrier than ever, and scared out of their minds, more than ever.The jokes are hilarious, including the ones that make Fred look like a putz...albeit ""a good putz"".The references to the old Scooby shows, such as ""Scooby and Shaggy, you go that way, and Daphne, Velma and I will go this way"", and Scooby and Shaggy always thinking of where the nearest plate of food is, connects the classic Scooby with the updated, yet still classic Scooby. The end of one episode, with Scooby and Shaggy doing their ""Lady and The Tramp"" impression with a plate of Spaghetti and Meatballs, is priceless.The Halloween episode where the gang goes to see a Kiss Concert, visits a Halloween festival, etc. is my favorite episode, as is the Christmas episode, which takes the classic ""Headless Horseman"" tale, and ""winterizes"" it. The ending of the Xmas show is very touching I must say. Scooby and Shaggy holding one another as they look at the Christmas tree....and present each other with a box of Scooby Snacks as Xmas gifts....very nice. I almost had tears in my eyes.Ok, so I'm sensitive, so what? Cant a man be sensitive?  Ahem, sorry for the outburst.All three seasons of ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" are fantastic, and in my view, along with the direct to DVD movies, are Scooby Doo at his best.It is wholesome family entertainment.Scooby Doooby Doooo!",1.0,291,0.0,0.0,0.08021818536785061,0.05503512362608755,0.0,0.3830736723252121,0.27057995746582947,0.14562950566036154,0.08625203589935686,0.04093164251646543,0.0,0.0,0.11368546458287791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05558170240848933,0.05302627501626552,0.0,0.0,0.032639388263512294,0.0,0.0,0.04380439436655687,0.0,0.053514803862990096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04633117121846032,0.0,0.0,0.11731193409083096,0.0,0.21580266032149348,0.05247433677471066,0.0,0.0,0.04388033743547053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047446647563456484,0.0,0.0,0.057344778623405555,0.0,0.1862220270688703,0.0,0.0,0.26139780886780867,0.0,0.0770971703106256,0.0,0.0,0.05495635225812682,0.046786726804523344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05144447501890377,0.12792365666452607,0.0,0.06244965714760929,0.08636951635147103,0.0,0.0,0.26781847656243835,0.12889188726986744,0.5449845249748602,0.10895442258798939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067777200348645,0.02533867901466786,0.04900479961547644,0.07838112963704273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557881656793218,0.0,0.0,0.11754214813305972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14175810327078228,0.0,0.05387816685709451,0.0,0.05048057093949984,0.1718594606534542,0.0,0.07542754253927993,

Money can corrupt elected official who may have been of sound character. Claude Rains portrays a senior senator who has become compromised by a rich campaign donor. Jimmy Stewart is appointed to fill out the term of a recently decease U.S. Senator and becomes caught up in a land deal that threatens a wilderness area within his state. The story focuses on Jimmy Stewart tenacious belief in right and wrong and putting the public's  interest first. The tactics that money and power can bring to bare on the untested and naive public servant is shown in all it's ugliness. Jean Arthur's character provides administrative and emotional support to Jimmy Stewart and is a delight to watch.

1552061,B008FYZHPG,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,22,23,1348012800,The Ultimate Goldfoot Choice,"This double-bill of both AIP's Dr. Goldfoot series, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" and the DVD premiere in Reg. 1 of ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"", it's somewhat controversial sequel is a pleasant way to get both films in one's collection.  AIP got Vincent Price to appear in both films, ""Bikini Machine"" becoming the first production by AIP that had a million dollar budget.  Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman and Susan Hart also star and directed by veteran Norman Taurog (considered ""the star's director"" having directed 10 Elvis vehicles in his career, and which included an Oscar win for directing Jackie Cooper in ""Skippy"" in 1931 among many others).  Many of the successful plot mechanics of ""Bikini Machine"" were recruited to be included in the sequel ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"", but what happened was the producers decided to take advantage of tax write-off by having the production foreign made and it was considered a coup that famed horror director Mario Bava agreed to direct what would become his only comedy.  Besides Price, ""Girl Bombs"" included Fabian in the cast and Laura Antonelli (who would later hit it big in Italian movies) and the blundering Italian comedy team of Franco and Ciccio.  A lot of ""Girl Bombs"" fails, but it is not entirely as bad as critics of the film generally agree.  I think some of the Goldfoot plot mechanics, the obligatory chases, in ""Bikini Machine"" mostly with go carts, but Bava was terribly inventive to parodying itself in ""Girl Bombs"" with everything, even a big balloon.  A lot went wrong with the production of ""Girl Bombs"" which included their reportedly losing the soundtrack which had to be re-dubbed with the actors doing a lot of lip reading as the script went through many changes.  I still like ""Girl Bombs"" anyway and this is a good way to get a good copy of both films as it well presented thanks to TGG Direct.  And, too, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" was not exactly without fault as the prototype for success.  Both films are presented as letterboxed.",0.9565217391304348,349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0568681947530938,0.0449446862912834,0.3463537177958815,0.039941749153280075,0.225720045964371,0.0,0.08458992966037414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042483568011885,0.13972890847632788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05743297859653009,0.05479243682895444,0.046224944294023095,0.05557660890220426,0.06745303602848342,0.0,0.1105188534519599,0.09052680055025333,0.0,0.11059447450070115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574867446073697,0.0,0.0,0.33335301270836437,0.0,0.08362142373916531,0.13555528754318794,0.0,0.0,0.045341872802279894,0.0,0.18319793986950245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05925477811197403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0781611466476138,0.3241251155256097,0.0,0.03983253427324756,0.055071385988122244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06609222385100454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049975210712117045,0.0,0.0,0.06659246372513067,0.49274442490534504,0.05629169987007749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05236528376977141,0.0,0.24297537925692755,0.060196555039824066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14459925175567645,0.0,0.12145715919786398,0.0,0.05153021667198299,0.05738416947295392,0.0976531215398928,0.0,0.16701810864925012,0.047258329848289746,0.0,0.14206690759890758,0.10619073266036302,0.0,
238217,6300271617,A1RH0M04HCGDR,7,7,1031961600,Landmark In History,"Almost 20 years have passed since Leone's gangster epic was first brought to our screens back in 1983. It's gritty realism and devoted marriage to cinema has yet to lose one shred of its impact and bravery of a time now gone, and will be as strong today as it truly ever will. After 16 years in the making, Leone along with his 322 page script set out to make what was to be his final masterpiece. Set over 4 decades in the Jewish district of New York, the film follows the deacy of five friends, Noodles, Max, Cockeye, Patsy and Dominic, and opens with a visually exciting entrance that will send shivers down your rewind finger. From here on in we are introduced into thier way of life and as the movie slowly unfolds, thier greed for more pulsates into a manic frenzy sending the film into a violent turn into the corruption of society. With a spot-on cast and a sharply written script, the near 4 hours it runs for is a healthy documentry into film-making. 1989 saw the death of Leone and the birth of the Director's Cut (the one to watch).

Empire Strikes Back (episode 5) was the best of the bunch; things went down hill from here.While Revenge of the Sith was the better of the final three installments, it still is weak when compared with episodes 4 & 5. Yes, the effects are great and there is a lot of action. It's just that the characters are weak, the acting is poor and the script - let's just say that George had too many ""yes"" men working for him.His last three movies have all had terrible scripts that not even good actors could make interesting. I still cring at the thought of Sidius lying on the edge of the building... all funked out from bad effects of the force and looking up saying ""no...No...NO!!!"".  If this doesn't suck I don't know what does.I watched it - twice for that matter.  After all I was reared on Star Wars.  I had to see how it ended... uh .. began... um middled. What ever, I had to know the whole story.Here's a word to the wise.  Once you've watched episodes 1, 2 & 3 do yourself a favor and jump right to Empire Stikes Back and renew your appreciation for the Star Wars saga.",0.29411764705882354,213,0.0,0.08872498315239641,0.17934598700611448,0.0,0.0,0.17842672234111936,0.1152272376792251,0.0,0.06427867712174459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847232322711217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364977455327245,0.0863063595166721,0.0,0.07903486045747422,0.0,0.0,0.14594554281058147,0.1303765471448623,0.0,0.13057957381026744,0.06741897075829353,0.31905202124215876,0.0,0.05715208250559625,0.0,0.0,0.09216328302273914,0.06905590956481718,0.08566980210874818,0.06665311451816301,0.0,0.0,0.12061897478864816,0.15642440972199545,0.0,0.13751365369875612,0.0,0.0,0.08808407663319208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052052505774727836,0.08547152473137835,0.0,0.0,0.2401115445210432,0.056371423466476764,0.27272663484270204,0.10760124553083457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06973490827185572,0.0,0.0,0.07756117120368039,0.07667721149901408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07533474443337478,0.0,0.19211140743621308,0.541527458097061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844812188291237,0.0,0.03776691761747749,0.0,0.15576785009475988,0.08682998243799678,0.0,0.0737043473358521,0.0,0.2085758974444056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408588717861825,0.07272176608987789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05123078506599249,0.0,0.05621180534945704,
853079,B0002ZDVEU,APZC5PRJVM0PY,5,6,1095379200,Ruined by the camera work,"Like the majority of reviewers I have seen the first Bourne Identity and I loved the movie.  The protaganist, Jason Bourne, is played by Matt Damon, who's previous performances have run the gambit from bad to good, but has been steadily better than most actors.The story, adapted from the Robert Ludlam novels in a take this-leave that nature, is much better than most adaptations if not completely accurate.  I think the first movie is better than the first book in most places, and is certainly smoother.  The second movie however, does deviate entirely from the book, with the only real connection being the manipulation of Bourne via Marie.  Although this doesn't give the second book much credit, I did find the storyline in the movie easier to get into than the storyline in the book of the same name.  The book's storyline would not fair well in today's climate, and I feel a lot of it would be lost on viewers.As the storyline from the book is missing, so is the Bourne charachter.  The novel Bourne relies on his smarts as much as his skills, but movie Bourne falls back on his skills more often than not as he stumbles from one situation to the next with little thought, planning or strategy.  As many reviewers have pointed out, he never tries to conceal who he is, which he did heavily in the books.  He also never waits for a perfect situation to present itself, instead he plunges into things head first again relying on his amazing skills to save his life - not like the novel Bourne at all.  He doesn't try and recruit allies or study his advesaries, another side of Bourne dropped for the movies.  While all of this cuts heavily into the Ludlam character, it doesn't ruin Bourne, it merely supplants him with someone else, a little more cinema Bond than true-to-life covert agent, that actually fits the action movie mold better.  However, I couldn't help but miss the conflicted and brooding Bourne from the first film.  To his credit, Matt Damon still plays the roll very well.Now, onto the real bad stuff that I have pushed to the end of my diatribe.  After previously stating that the first film was smoother than the book of same name (Bourne Identity), this is sadly not the case with the second film.  If you can concentrate on the flow of the movie, the script, the setup and the acting, the Bourne Supremacy is great (not stupendous), but great.  However, the horrible camera work makes that impossible.  I am not arguing against the insertion of the shaky camera technique, as it worked so well in films such as Saving Private Ryan, but in the excessiveness of its insertion, and the excessiveness of the shaking.  Too much shaky cam, and way, way too much shaking of the shaky cam.  Instead of sticking with the formula of using the up close and personal hand-held camera angle strictly in an acton sense, the Director uses it exclusively throughout the film as if he couldn't tell when to start and when to stop.  I was one of those whose excitement at seeing the movie faded in the opening scene when the camera zooms onto Matt Damons upper lip and we watch as the upper half of his head bounces on and off the screen - no joke! And all we are doing is standing in a bathroom looking in the mirror, not running, not fighting, not performing anything at all that warrants this type of camera work.  I suffered, and eventually I was able to put the bouncing camera into the back of my mind and concentrate on the film.  However, at the rare occasions they switch to a stable platform you let out an involuntary sigh of relief because for a moment you can get your bearings and the screen stops spinning.  But alas, it is only for a moment and then the screen starts bouncing and spinning out of control again.The issue is only compounded during action sequences when a little jarring is to be expected.  With the Supremacy, the action scenese are a jumbled mess and a large portion of the film simply takes place out of the view of the lens, which is focusing on a shoulder, wall, floor, upper-right corner of the windshield, etc.  Added to that is the darkness that has been heavily layered over this film to the point that you cannot focus on the objects on the screen - when you do suddenly catch a glimpse of something, it is just that, a glimpse! The angle shifts, you are back in shadows and again the camera spins and dips and jumps and flips.  When other reviewers commented on members of the audience becoming sick they were not joking - I myself had to look away periodicly just to adjust, and in the screening of the film someone actually threw up.Without beating the dead horse anymore, this movie is ruined by the camera work.  I understand what the Director (Paul Greengrass) was going for, but he didn't succeed.  In an attempt to put the viewer on the same level as the actor, we forgoe the structure of a ""movie"" and enter a ""video game"" instead - only we don't have the luxury of directing the camera at all.  The scenes lose any cinema value because we (the viewers) simply can't see them.  The action scenes put you right in the action, but while you realize there is a conflict, you can't tell from where the blows are coming or who the assailant is, nor can we see how Bourne is responding to the attack because he is a blur - see my hands, see his head, see the floor, see my hands, hear a smack but your looking at the wall, someone fell can't tell who they are blur look at wall door wall fist noise - you see where I'm going.  Frankly, I won't watch another film Greengrass touches after this one.If I wasn't such a fan of the first one and if I didn't like the story so much, I wouldn't hesitate to give this movie the lowest possible rating because it is simply UNWATCHABLE.  Although this is the type of series that warrants having each installment, this movie will be impossible to watch on your TV - but at least maybe it won't be so overwhelming you need to throw up!",0.8333333333333334,1077,0.0,0.03490670002338441,0.05879945296868684,0.016136167371220145,0.038258730574721345,0.1825139708594831,0.05666671434137222,0.10674556186559347,0.10115556725819985,0.04800424099431356,0.0681961664601076,0.03260473656783515,0.0,0.0986004532540654,0.026431752271618876,0.08426556088396746,0.016454990937216935,0.01697757550758955,0.0,0.0,0.11804561354249685,0.1103877882786874,0.04784895510479242,0.08976362693181297,0.03135936923475413,0.012843344259494734,0.02652436444087975,0.01569041323206735,0.027180964667169773,0.05621276355465504,0.13983430978189051,0.0,0.01812970799960158,0.1222577030131753,0.016852356444724825,0.06555764203734772,0.13758232040993532,0.06590963062592668,0.18190937710182992,0.06923407840227178,0.017726342310656392,0.02705071158219993,0.03859683176011276,0.0,0.017327275422472675,0.0,0.027822488470774252,0.04994795906554944,0.1228728013229158,0.01681335272397244,0.09409955209140912,0.05459985549240782,0.01574434723072169,0.12197885695854103,0.24525189102251302,0.13758260487541457,0.045209413989215345,0.06250531465102037,0.042206298919830146,0.016113071793455842,0.05487102815275428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055837841682011,0.018753455962973713,0.0,0.0,0.050646673607472284,0.0,0.029638634258823366,0.10993323662155811,0.10392468580158083,0.7057310697039278,0.0,0.016824161571998755,0.01726172877633368,0.013464629537471729,0.03987976067352797,0.08172164473666102,0.0,0.1761888995878102,0.03416115779692911,0.0,0.0434957908944235,0.014011740863540447,0.041029572649760544,0.0488417930000278,0.034463078312206165,0.10059614855506603,0.043864599773449996,0.016282573538588915,0.0138543795906594,0.08583186326595095,0.03159390079569111,0.05363759644048458,0.014800783354439583,0.06046654220906824,0.030131278879516235,0.12163346856373637,

1307684,B002ZG98J6,A1GYO3ZLWWZ0FZ,5,6,1293062400,I watched the movie 1st... read the book 2nd... What were they thinking?,"The book was awesome. Hands down. A great book. I loved reading about the greek gods growing up. Good adventures. The stories of Hercules, the Iliad, the stories of Hermes... they were all truly awesome stories.  Mr. Riodran has done what JK Rowlings has done. He has taken a world that we are all familiar with... reintroduced it, creating a fantastic ride of adventure. A true treasure of a book.The movie... was awful. The entire story line was changed. The entire plot rearranged. Sub-plots became the major plots and the major plots became sub-plots.  They took out several major characters, including Ana-Beth and Ares.This is the third movie that I have seen directed by Chris Columbus - the first was HP 1 the second HP 2.  Columbus did what he did with the first two Harry Potter movies.  He ruined it. Destroyed it. There is no excuse for the creative liberty he took this time - because the books were fairly concise and they needed no changes.  The readers loved the book - why did you have to ruin it?!A shameful excuse to make a few bucks. Horrible directing - for the simple fact that he pretty much rewrote the entire book.Dissapointed. A shame that something like this was approved and allowed to be produced. A sham because the people who read this book will never know the real joy or enchantment of Mr. Riodran's writting.If I could give it no stars - I would.",0.8333333333333334,245,0.060660635852739515,0.0,0.10292135922166736,0.0,0.0,0.12287258449237984,0.04959412858607612,0.0,0.0,0.05251602568235568,0.14921146778183428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05783199785579066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13801466118554456,0.08375383184847608,0.0,0.0,0.056201817423494546,0.058034630913148186,0.0,0.17841376623803465,0.09839367100459795,0.30595389289251074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05737537753492839,0.0,0.0,0.06921966329109139,0.1683137695132038,0.0,0.0,0.05629925373223447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961418208447613,0.07357437136133331,0.0686291376480117,0.0,0.2066893740372105,0.0,0.16768902003249925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156420160997974,0.0,0.06002820300874357,0.07799140256121767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06484857361293113,0.0,0.16537058485714942,0.6409561060331348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05892053001542361,0.17451179248810791,0.13003990419939523,0.06287402989337178,0.10056438403064695,0.0,0.07661805280433664,0.06344511858043263,0.0,0.22442913859070737,0.0,0.0,0.0733672666086553,0.0,0.14250341760073615,0.12125211261769309,0.0,0.0,0.058678844490885534,0.06476747076182753,0.08819949842767232,0.06592646744133875,0.048387439614185526,

938015,B000B8QFYG,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,1,1,1135123200,Emperors' sequel can still pack a Groove,"The Emperor's New Groove was definitely one of the more original and satisfyingly funny Disney films, straying away from the typical outcast-becomes-hero storyline that has been plaguing the company's  storytelling for years. To add insult to injury, they have been releasing sequels to all their classics. So upon hearing that they were adding a second 'New Groove' movie, it was both a skeptical and an exciting anticipation. Does Kronk's New Groove live up to its predecessor? Not quite. But much like The Three Musketeers before it, it is still one of the better straight-to-home features that Disney has released, and that alone makes it worth a look.In this sequel we follow Izma's former henchman, Kronk, and his background and hardships following the events of the first film. Most of the characters make a comeback here, and we are even introduced to a new one, Ms. Birdwell. Her persona is pretty questionable (why'd they give her an English accent?), and the romance between her and Kronk may turn people off, but luckily it's kept to a minimum. The movie retains a very similar visual flair to the first film, so those who enjoyed Emperor should have no difficulty adjusting to this one. The soundtrack has its own share of funky tunes to groove to, while all of the other original characters' voices make a short, but sweet, return.Kronk's New Groove still lacks the quick wit humor found in its predecessor, which will disappoint those looking for the same kind of laughs. And while it borrows a lot of the same comedic slapstick cues used in the first film, they aren't as effectively funny the second time around. It tries hard to imitate Emperor, but everything comes off recycled and tired. However, the movie makes up for it in its richer well-made storyline, at least enough to keep you interested all the way through. It also goes as far to teach some moral values, even more so than the previous film. As a sequel, this is a three-star movie. But standing on its own, it does deserve four stars. Anyone who enjoyed The Emperor's New Groove should still look into it, and hope that Disney decides to produce more original content.",1.0,369,0.0,0.0,0.11045233339162802,0.050518535127026164,0.07985270934086923,0.24174962558216986,0.03548202411551095,0.10025855507137123,0.039586778572200186,0.0,0.0,0.10207774198893085,0.0,0.15434738456358588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09734909492579973,0.16425465814072746,0.14811348669974742,0.08988227738258164,0.04014696423400509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12764578664205833,0.0703955630824205,0.0,0.1585893790444242,0.0,0.04252889330417669,0.0,0.0,0.1076844508145667,0.051586877995636195,0.07428461288212672,0.2649234794123768,0.2774849894937817,0.0,0.04027919303280703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130658476278479,0.05212509403103743,0.1282285891683513,0.0,0.04910058481675072,0.0,0.04929183865841171,0.0347170034993181,0.19195646008370512,0.03313374568096964,0.1415400148092133,0.0,0.0,0.050446228318989095,0.0,0.055798799280779854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11892209442510798,0.04439519223006933,0.0,0.04916786308252365,0.14789258444458578,0.4794149439309798,0.05000640919926185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16647216934849127,0.06977759991447517,0.04498310401893649,0.3597429777542984,0.0,0.0,0.09078337664811358,0.0438674566717779,0.06422695859150189,0.0,0.05394788589655638,0.1049809401763861,0.04577657286905909,0.05097689831444725,0.0,0.0,0.0494565267708367,0.08396333334831353,0.046337762654368245,0.0,0.0,0.03461870080645771,

Release date was Tues Mar 2 and I got it delivered free on Mar 2 with my Prime membership. This Thomas is CGI animated and features Mr. Perkins in the middle of each episode, like Splish Splash Splosh. The first episode features Charlie and all of the other Sodor engines, while the next episode and those following have Hiro in them (he has returned for the summer from his homeland).When we got the package I told my 2 yr old that he got mail and he was so excited to open it up even though he had no idea what was inside. He was soooo happy to see a new Thomas movie that he made me take it to the sitters that day.

625716,B00005JN0T,A3MFRIOLO36IDZ,6,17,1106956800,You Robot; Me Bored,"This movie centres on digital effects and considerable noise. There is the ghost of a story here and, like a ghost, appears unexpectedly at times but, again like a ghost, is difficult to see and vanishes quickly.The movie holds your attention to a degree but in the way a series of explosions do. One goes off, then another then ... there's a pause, and then another. So when they stop you wait for the next one because you know it will happen shortly.I suppose my biggest problem with the film is the digital look. It is so excessive you want to tear your hair out. The actors look like people lost in a Twilight Zone episode where they've found themselves in a huge video game.As for the characters, it's fitting that James Cromwell plays a character who is seen only as a holographic image - something with no depth. This is pretty much what every character is.It's hard to fault the actors given what they have to work with. In fact, Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is quite good and effective given the little room she has to actually act. But she's about the only one.For instance, there is the movie's star, Will Smith as Del Spooner . He appears to have phoned in his performance. But to be fair he has to spend the majority of his time being an action figure. But riding motorcycles and jumping from ledges is not acting. As an actor in I, Robot, he's a great stunt man.The sad thing about this movie is that there actually are the seeds of a pretty good story here.

In fact, I am often heard to say ""I just don't feel like ""reading"" a movie""...no matter HOW good it is supposed to be.  Once I saw the theatrical trailer for this one though, I was hooked.  Amelie sucks you in.  It is hilarious, charming and just a wonderful feel-good movie.  Amelie tries to fix everyone else's life which is fun to watch....  including sending her reclusive father's garden gnome on a world tour complete with pictures sent back home.  It is hard to pin point one reason why this is such a good movie.  If you are like me, and don't normally watch foreign films, do yourself a favor and watch this one.  You will not be disappointed.",0.6666666666666666,139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325344392576053,0.07709373356476726,0.0,0.0,0.24490740782807244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06707180009362557,0.0,0.0,0.111933142927812,0.23097592616239407,0.0,0.0,0.08922126884763563,0.0,0.06509737928299389,0.0,0.0,0.2620960219584772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114858604594169,0.0,0.0,0.11463617511519927,0.08918963181656886,0.11698594664639445,0.0,0.2690037324652444,0.15698556186478482,0.0,0.1840092879650965,0.2625504141843125,0.0,0.0,0.1074197364325504,0.0,0.0,0.2089569493671314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10709907259174313,0.07543153144900512,0.0,0.07199150063185868,0.230648796026928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12853372134868188,0.04528917642801776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516096060101562,0.0,0.31265329383125023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06977471207968716,0.3322405595713665,0.0,0.0,0.09946126243493128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10745689945695362,0.0,0.10068059016119198,0.06855275842308195,0.20496448513930832,0.22565383144233384,

So much of this movie was to set the stage for dwarves in barrels bobbing down the river that there must be an amusement park ride tied into the deal.  I thought that perhaps this part of the franchise was farmed out to a lesser director but no.  It has a feel of someone having picked up scraps that were edited out of the other movies and just stapled all of them together for this POS movie.,0.42857142857142855,95,0.0,0.0,0.09993151428574377,0.0,0.10836985402506578,0.05965158022292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198089124345698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08378728122000334,0.0,0.11934330275936446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626415995114406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11548725463415796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14320554135948416,0.0,0.07307045879764096,0.14001935523895195,0.0672088458930091,0.06536971524587147,0.0,0.11493383162746955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341906382785174,0.0,0.0,0.2610327239623582,0.14287410112655885,0.13327094980391094,0.0,0.1337900593262707,0.0,0.45588952494862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13692335411457385,0.3497063741800788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10759451261021549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24084990357786168,0.33945625043309163,0.0,0.14296595100750326,0.0,0.11441780076531158,0.0,0.18939340641961,0.0,0.1301906783378994,0.0,0.0,0.12320410110647777,0.0,0.174327613539662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13836372177192643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396358830903535,

394821,6303998046,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0,0,1242259200,"It Takes Two, But It Gets The Job Done Fine","""It Takes Two"" is the friendly middle ground as far as Mary-Kate & Ashley movies are concerned: it retains their trademark ""adorable"" factor without the cloying cutesy-ness of their previous three films and exercises a family-friendly comprehensiveness that was forever lost on their later made-for-teen-girls DTV flicks. In short, this is probably the most perfect Mary-Kate & Ashley outing if there ever was such a thing, and is definitely the most tasteful of their offerings to introduce new fans to.The story: Amanda Lemmon (Mary-Kate Olsen) - a tough-talking orphan raised in New York City under the care of her case worker Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley,Cheers) - is set to be adopted by a creepy couple exploiting child labor. Alyssa Callaway (Ashley Olsen) is the well-bred young daughter of a wealthy widower (Steve Guttenberg,Police Academy series), who's looking to marry a gold-digging witch of a woman (Jane Sibbett, ""Santa Barbara"") promising to ship her off to boarding school. When all seems out of their control, the two identical strangers meet during a summer outing and concoct a plan involving them switching identities to bring their two guardians together in hopes of having them fall in love, thereby stopping the marriage and allowing Diane to adopt Amanda.Granted, the synopsis seems like the half-baked kind of plot that you'd find in some of the twins' later movies, but if you can suspend disbelief enough to allow for their chance meeting that kicks off most of the action, the absurdity is very digestible for the fact that it's not overdone and is pulled off marvelously by the cast. Alley, Guttenberg, and Philip Bosco (My Best Friend's Wedding) as the latter's colorful butler give exceptionally warm performances and end up as likeable as the girls themselves, while Sibbett is a perfectly hiss-able children's villain who looks best when being played a trick on. On the whole, the twins do a good job (and would both be nominated by the Young Artist Awards for their performances), but I was disappointed that their initial distinctive personalities dissolve into a collective persona: Amanda starts off as a slang-spewing stickball player and Alyssa as an eloquent little prude, but halfway into the movie, you can't tell the two apart. It's kinda sloppy on the part of director Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama, but thankfully this is not a fatal goof.The film is obviously aimed at children between six and twelve, but lacks the asininity to inspire grown-up headaches even if a parent doesn't really like the movie. It's mushy and a bit sing-songy in some parts, but makes up for it in handy humor - both physical and situational - and definite heart, allowing me to deem ""It Takes Two"" the most intelligent, competent, and integrating film that the Olsen twins have ever been a part of.

Where long ago there were just a few options outside of the printed page for them to see their heroes, many are popping up not just on TV but on the big screen as well, far more than at any one time (with the exception of perhaps the golden age of serials). These heroes are also being given a much better reception on DVD as well with some fantastic animated pieces coming out. And just in time for the release of the much touted GREEN LANTER in theaters is this gem, GREEN LANTER: EMERALD KNIGHTS.For those who don't know who the Green Lantern is watch GREEN LANTER: FIRST FLIGHT. In short you'll learn that a group of cosmic brains trusts known as the Guardians forged rings out of the greatest power that exists, that of will power, and entrusted them to those brave enough to wield them throughout the galaxy as a sort of space cop. Yeah you'll get that in this DVD as well but not as in depth.At present there is a force that is unstoppable that has sworn vengeance against the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps, an all powerful entity filled with anti-matter known as Krona. As the Lanterns charge their rings from the central battery, new recruit Arisia (Elizabeth Moss) talks to Hal Jordan (Nathan Fillion), Earth's Green Lantern, and is told tales of the most legendary of the Lanterns.Each story tells about the different Lanterns and how their nature has helped to change the Corps from what they were to what they are now. Stories range from the first Lantern to the man who trained Kilowog (one of the more well known Lantern's for those who read the comic, saw the earlier DVD or who have seen the new movie).The main point stressed in this direct to DVD feature is that the diversity of the Corps' make up has helped to make it what it is today. Each different group of aliens has helped to make the whole that much better. A nice idea and one that should take place in today's world. But not as something forced but as a fact of nature that merely exists. These Corps members aren't thrust upon the group but meld in to become a part of the whole.Through each story we see an act of heroism as well. Members are willing to give their lives to do what's right. They act not because they are told to but because inside they feel the need to do so, that they have no choice but to do the right thing. That's something missing from so many heroes depicted on the big screen today. Amazing that it has to come out in the form of a comic book rather than in that of an everyday person who makes the choice to do the right thing.The animation is top notch here as it has been all along in the new DC Universe titles. My copy is the blu-ray edition and the colors just feel like they leap off the screen at you. They're deep, bright, and dark when need by and just seem to glow just as the light of the lantern does. Cartoons have come such a far way from where they once were.With any luck we will have the chance to see more stories of the Green Lantern and the Green Lantern Corps. They are ripe for fans of the comic book and for fans of science fiction. At its heart these stories travel into that area more than most comics have currently or in the past. In so doing they have transported us to different worlds to meet different peoples only to discover they're not quite that different from us inside.The extras feature a few other animated pieces to enjoy as well as a look at the next DCU animated feature being worked on, BATMAN:YEAR ONE. Based on the Frank Miller comic, it was the story that changed the way Batman would look from then on. Unfortunately we don't get to see any animation from that, just who's doing voices and such.The DCU animated features are better than most. I'd have to say that many appear to be better than those coming from the Marvel comics group. Here's hoping that they continue to feature quality over quantity and that perhaps we will find ourselves transported once more to the world of the Green Lantern Corps down the road.",0.0,749,0.01945033364685108,0.0,0.033000886787744356,0.02264084977496785,0.053681283268552045,0.1280437696572415,0.11131364418698492,0.22466396524746976,0.0887078677632335,0.033677662852335165,0.04784342912821576,0.02287404826691932,0.0,0.09684323414340995,0.037086708305854484,0.0,0.09235277976168269,0.047642879224974594,0.09146282530533395,0.0,0.0,0.0442532652432577,0.08056493065501977,0.16193368344347742,0.044000706707353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11441381158434888,0.11042192288395278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023645743245062467,0.0,0.16891297694039326,0.023119648107808224,0.09987621909227425,0.05396842496571287,0.0248720432852625,0.13284312135719453,0.018051892364251122,0.0,0.07293632325902781,0.0,0.09759516732518604,0.07008257981919022,0.014367024978637838,0.0,0.06601610449930087,0.019152427858169334,0.02209108224121913,0.07779545258870657,0.2473332792576095,0.10394666226781553,0.06343387044743799,0.021925488974459,0.039480109141059525,0.022608444093085777,0.05774264778111009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465478435687407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0532972159234877,0.019896556293337416,0.06237948426831057,0.11017760105360519,0.2783797643984186,0.5418183371716914,0.08964532289934635,0.07081854804396612,0.02422013846846077,0.037784766062505325,0.24247500343149253,0.031272168786150634,0.040320080459326106,0.3117030402104744,0.0,0.0,0.040686310234175196,0.0,0.014392271245760443,0.022843501653021684,0.04835555810119312,0.09409844089073298,0.12309389101665895,0.06853882206773043,0.077756984002771,0.020071952624636093,0.0,0.1317042198982338,0.06230146938313006,0.05656088657124318,0.021138779207742067,0.04654510284548545,

1510854,B00664AM02,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0,1,1321142400,At least I didn't lose mine ....,"THE SONG OF LUNCH (2010, dir. Niall MacCormick) stars Alan Rickman as ""He"" and Emma Thompson as ""She"". ""He"" is a semi-lecherous, washed-up old poet with one sad book published. ""She"" is his old flame, his muse, now happily married to a successful author. They meet for lunch in an old haunt; apparently ""He"" wishes to try to get away with something. Poet Christopher Reid dashed this off, as a poem, and apparently it caught someone's attention and here we are.This is a Masterpiece Modern Classic production (or whatever they call those) - I'm normally not too enthralled by what I've been seeing there. Masterpiece Mystery, Masterpiece Classic of course, any day. The only thing that can save this recitation of lousy poetry is the presence of two legendary stars, all-time favorites of mine and my wife's.What saves this movie is the pair of powerhouse performances by the two great stars, and some occasionally funny lines (my favorite expression of Reid's is ""restaurant semaphore"" to describe how we call the wait staff). It is all a quiet, mostly two-star show set in a little restaurant. The funniest thing for me was seeing Emma's real-life husband, the handsome Greg Wise (Sense and Sensibility,Cranford), making his cameo appearance as 'Her' husband ... in a photo on the back of his ""newest book"".I emphasize: it takes power, skill and discipline especially for Emma, because she is an outsider watching Alan Rickman have an internal dialogue/meltdown in verse. Not truly horrid verse, mind you, but I've read - and yes, I have occasionally written - much better. They make it work, the setting is good, it's all of about 42 minutes and so I shall call it an attempt at 'eccentric old-school classic'. If you are an Anglophile, a fan of the stars (HOW CAN YOU NOT BE??), even if you're just into weird short films, this is for you.I can't say I'll ever stoop to adding it to my collection, much as I love the stars. I can get as much by reading Reid's original poem. It does hearten me that production companies are trying this sort of thing - very art-house - but I read someplace the real reason.Money's tight all over, and I suppose Emma and Alan still have bills to pay....",0.0,381,0.04681326975264679,0.0,0.15885377015333033,0.0,0.21533447188670846,0.26076524332482665,0.11481894083422718,0.216289447775756,0.04270060779604853,0.04052787845107984,0.05757503686918507,0.055053502489800024,0.0,0.0665952357863632,0.1338910256000236,0.18971126097085433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05250320525760121,0.0,0.0,0.12926968759967136,0.0,0.10590136857276411,0.04337229247022863,0.04478671866427207,0.0,0.0,0.11389913898710162,0.1416671808843495,0.05702125069227343,0.0,0.18349657723924379,0.11382165233059051,0.088555913994141,0.11615472806354521,0.05564461479725397,0.2670923840709216,0.20782684611310315,0.0,0.04567546234710728,0.0,0.05395250540449193,0.0,0.10665648850707614,0.0,0.0,0.03457870842112126,0.0,0.15888826197308023,0.13828880080230527,0.0,0.11234335329216212,0.2847012182079607,0.03573999022316674,0.0381683284028282,0.05277049990277171,0.04751057315110813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18187303349532524,0.06183363184538225,0.042758768587931546,0.047887243160968596,0.0,0.0,0.06381022626324058,0.2922879952647113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04547038828074502,0.13467494202658892,0.15053237643287193,0.04852139909940403,0.18108521831713173,0.05768153905843872,0.17738397513137666,0.048962121956727285,0.04731799681389513,0.03463947140516649,0.0,0.0,0.11323856383909721,0.0,0.0,0.09357316777605174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06806567148366453,0.0,0.18670874706933,

It was the ultimate adventure with a good versues evil premise.I was very disappointed when I saw The Phantom Menace. The film was too focused  on Anakin Skywalker, and it lowered its standards. I anxiously waited with anticipation for Attack Of The Clones, and aside from it being a little better, there were still alot of flaws in the film. The worst was the romance. It totally ruined the pace in the film, and talk about rehashing of certain scenes. Haven't I seen that scene with the  starship weaving through th easteroids before? Han Solo did it in the Empire Strikes Back and the ending was way too fast. I didn't know what had transpired until I read the book. And again I'm reminded of The Empire Strikes Back. The ending was the same.

541220,B00003CXXY,A2YP45I4D63NAN,3,3,1333670400,Excellente!,"NTSC/Region 0. Includes the Uncut version, not issued on the US pressing. The latest triumph from Giuseppe Tornatore, the writer and director of the Academy Award-winning Cinema Paradiso, Malena is an utterly unforgettable story of a boy's journey into manhood amid the chaos and intolerance of World War II. In a sleepy Italian village, the most beautiful woman in town, Malena (Monica Bellucci), becomes the subject of increasingly malicious gossip among the lustful townsmen and their jealous wives. But only her most ardent admirer, young Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), will learn the untold true story of the mysterious and elusive Malena! In a captivating motion picture nominated for two Academy Awards, the eventual struggles and hardships that Malena must bravely endure serve to inspire Renato to new heights of compassion, courage, and independence!The cut version of the film offered on the US DVD is heavily edited, with virtually all of the cuts affecting the first story, and specifically Renato's dreams and fantasies (most of which show Malena seducing or making love to Renato). This shorter version of the film runs at approximately 92 minutes.This Uncut Korean version of the film runs at approximately 104 minutes. Initially, it was available on DVD only in Italy, courtesy of local distributors Medusa. Later on, Korean distributors Spectrum also released the uncut version of the film on DVD (their release is essentially an NTSC-encoded replica of the Italian PAL-encoded release). Unlike the Italian DVD release, the Korean DVD release is English-friendly. However, interestingly enough, the uncut version of the film can only be seen as intended by director Tornatore if one turns on the English subtitles on the disc. If one turns on the Korean subtitles, plenty of the footage that is missing from the Miramax cut release is optically censored.Note: In 2001, Malena won Best Cinematography Award (Lajos Koltai) at the David di Donatello Awards as well as Silver Ribbon Award for Best Score (Ennio Morricone) granted by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.",1.0,332,0.0,0.0,0.03509960201083354,0.048161421927823245,0.07612691098376716,0.1676145300194251,0.0,0.09558065293312581,0.11321917039667401,0.035819418137908565,0.0,0.0,0.09948653271019872,0.029429157012298503,0.0788905285969948,0.04191773195324924,0.0,0.0,0.24319867430015843,0.0,0.23488620189901036,0.047067583598845636,0.057125677060528054,0.07654754353954951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05039661831197161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07826763781305923,0.1283250854786704,0.04917991764487706,0.1416372258128745,0.022960234367417495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04768439465697658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490790641698502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033097164226875725,0.388875174043762,0.25270222927531777,0.06746799324006991,0.13991913766066968,0.04199087518793846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05464990516907337,0.0,0.0,0.13269310522115257,0.0,0.05639686219342846,0.6557619642310489,0.09534638193626513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04434792658630952,0.0,0.06859159036829418,0.0,0.052258601724938986,0.0,0.0,0.0306151162547401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04364071196468759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047148965165078514,0.0,0.04417571754162879,0.03007895849586395,0.0,0.0,
1538043,B007TZN3ZS,A34K2MP7V1AHK1,9,10,1355270400,Spectacular 3D Presentation!!!!,"Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92"" Da-Lite screen. I just got done watching this and it blew my mind! The Chinese just schooled most American film makers and studios on how to really use 3D in a live-action movie. The only live action film that I have watched so far in 3D that this is comparable to is Avatar. Avatar has more jaw dropping visuals in 3D, but the action scenes in this film are truly spectacular and have to be seen to be believed. I would have loved to have watched this in Imax 3D. Holy smokes that must have been awesome!The most negative thing about this movie is that the story telling is lacking at times leaving the viewer somewhat confused as to what is going on. The central premise of the plot remains the same throughout, so that helps. Unlike what the official Blu-ray.com reviewer alluded to; Jet Li has a solid supporting role in this film. He isn't the main star, but he is in a large portion of the film. This movie is very much an ensemble action piece. My big complaint with most 3D films is that they are conversions and aren't shot in native 3D. If you are going to charge a significant premium for 3D content than shoot the dang movies in native 3D, don't convert it! When I see Blu-Ray 3D conversions at retail stores and on-line being sold for $35-$40 I feel sick to my stomach. For every great conversion there are 10 that are just OK and nothing special. I have never understood professional reviewers who refer to pop-outs in 3D as gimmicky.  3D is all about utilizing the technology to tell your story and take it to a level that isn't otherwise possible and that includes scenes with objects that extend beyond the screen.  Films that use the technology to only display depth are missing a real opportunity in most cases.  Not taking advantage of what 3D is capable of is like having an exotic sports car and never testing its limits.Once this movie got rolling I didn't want it to stop. Keep in mind that this movie is very much fantasy with characters flying around and doing things with super human strength very much like a comic book. Ghosting was an issue at times with the subtitles I was reading since the English dub just wasn't that great as usual so I left the English subtitles turned on for most of the film. The PQ, AQ, and 3D are an easy 5.0 on this release. If you own a 3D display, order this thing today! It's worth every penny and you will want to show it to your friends. It has a lot of replay value. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!",0.9,464,0.07081587483043433,0.0,0.030037873777458136,0.0,0.13029723485140368,0.2151641531905746,0.20263850576520095,0.0817969271413994,0.0968917866508611,0.06130776984174361,0.0,0.04164056433031209,0.0,0.05037033203052131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04336522232747812,0.0,0.0,0.20101316483677895,0.0,0.09777511873019826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06775024858877002,0.0,0.10414106908317582,0.1722987352181011,0.07143476911635989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043045379691623566,0.06698062914681611,0.2635662514167605,0.0,0.24242332490512614,0.13754390580597792,0.04527777096387872,0.13818935705562788,0.06572435071447948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035533000507035395,0.2126338503312846,0.13077069281246692,0.04294575386334968,0.12017758352881064,0.1045968638786786,0.0,0.028324208380819938,0.11745717287126034,0.16219495161037908,0.0,0.0798275603391887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03897114247505091,0.03852699085822849,0.0,0.0,0.046768819569863236,0.09702375908238924,0.0,0.07570491814582823,0.0401140841437072,0.3137150067591147,0.357123618782846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0343922283360524,0.03395448871564064,0.20873871486469045,0.0,0.31306649886108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10736908649956776,0.0524001951622272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616325945179447,0.036539550181411876,0.0,0.03425115520342348,0.0378051189051809,0.12870629678041567,0.03848163146255338,0.08473202148923599,

304346,6302256755,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0,0,1061164800,That's not his name.  Who is he?  Doctor who?,"23 November 1963.  One day after the assassination of President Kennedy, something earthshattering took place across the Atlantic.  At 5:15 PM, Greenwich Time, a legend was born on BBC1.""Have you ever wondered what it's like to be travelers in the fourth dimension?  Have you?  To be exiles?  Susan and I are cut off from our own planet without friends or protection, but one day, we shall get back.  Yes, one day...""That's what two teachers at Coal Hill School, Ian Chesterton (science) and Barbara Wright (history) discover when an extraordinary student, Susan Foreman, piques their curiosity.  She is brilliant in some things, outdoing even them, but not in others--she is eight years behind Britain's decimal currency conversion, for example.  Also, she flips through a book of the French Revolution Barbara loans her, peers closely at a page, and says, ""But that's not right!""  Ian and Barbara become curious and follow their mysterious pupil home.They meet Susan and her grandfather, an eccentric, Edwardian-looking gentlemen wearing a long coat and Astrakhan hat, who whisk them away in a time machine shaped like a police box.  Naturally, Ian and Barbara are befuddled, as the space within appears larger than the box.  However, it becomes clear when Susan explains the name of the machine, the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimensions In Space).The travellers then land during the dawn of man and become embroiled in power politics within a primitive tribe who have lost the secret of fire with the death of the firemaker, father of the current leader Za.  The problem is simple.  Without meat, they go hungry.  Without fire, they freeze to death.  And the leader is the one who makes fire.  Kal, a newcomer the Za's tribe took in, vies for the leadership.  And Hur, a woman of the tribe, is to be given to whoever will become leader, although she clearly favours Za.  Then there's the Old Mother, a pyrophobic ancient who believes fire will bring about evil.  She is played by Eileen Way, who would later play Karela, Lady Adrasta's vizier, in the 1979 Who story, The Creature From The Pit.One will observe that the cavemen speak English and that the travellers understand them.  We learn why this is in The Masque Of Mandragora (1976), where it's a Time Lord gift that is shared by the Doctor to whoever else is part of the TARDIS crew.Having seen the first story so late since I first got into the show, it's interesting to see Ian and Barbara's personalities.  Ian is initially skeptical about time travel and the TARDIS, yet Barbara's mind is more open.  And the Doctor is shown as a tetchy anti-hero, but who can blame him?  After all, Ian and Barbara barged their way into the TARDIS and blew his cover.And for those not in the know, the title of my review is the line spoken by Ian to Barbara, when the latter calls him Dr. Foreman, after the name on the junkyard where they found the TARDIS, and explains the name of the show.  Funny thing is, the Time Lord was never called Doctor Who, except for a goof in The War Machines and in the Peter Cushing movies, but always simply the Doctor.The beginning of a legend in TV history.  I'll conclude with something the Doctor tells Ian, who demands proof they have landed back in time.  ""If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cry of strange birds and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you?""  All I can say is, if the Doctor landed that TARDIS and asked me if I wanted to go places, I wouldn't wait to pack my bags.  To tweak a well-known bumper sticker, I'd say ""Dematerialize, Doctor.

1270092,B002IFT1ZA,A38UC8E9LNQZDS,0,0,1367193600,Game of Thrones: 1st season,"I liked it very much.  Enough to immediately order the 2nd season.  It has what is so sadly lacking in most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  A real story line.  Charactors that are more than one dimensional (at least some of them).  Complex subplots.  And, just like in the real world, the good guys don't always win.  In hours of programming, I never had a moment of boredom.  In addition, the acting & direction are excellent, the sets, costuming, supurb.  If the option existed, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  There was nothing about it I didn't like.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that whatever that magic something is that elevates a film to instant classical greatness wasn't quite there.  That said, I would recommend the series highly to anyone who enjoys costume drama.  They won't be disappointed.",0.0,148,0.09876615045574061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05001452752787138,0.16149587279449956,0.0,0.09008929896202458,0.08550529714974685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209620324029845,0.0,0.0,0.09345031053838229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150641231341863,0.0,0.11179124327528996,0.09682963057195004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341717392851463,0.24506203921850842,0.0,0.16905262159714624,0.27404432627230996,0.0,0.09636561620553867,0.18333011141401243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911499879440917,0.11862327142940292,0.0,0.0,0.11174026845096355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2730271245839168,0.0,0.08052714295746687,0.11133465277176278,0.0,0.0,0.09773643890482824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13361484664562925,0.0,0.0,0.09021200599684814,0.1010320084014095,0.10558484737686237,0.11189337643341303,0.4038784584604075,0.4269227382999944,0.0,0.11986898696550684,0.0,0.19186590613927762,0.09471193144663273,0.0,0.0,0.16373644858869704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998310183689143,0.07308199710439078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09870984889564627,0.0,0.0,0.09553944666232962,0.0,0.0,0.1073398475105613,0.0,

The biggest news was not only the Fantasia Anthology, but the Toy Story Ultimate Toy Box!  Coming in a custom-slip case, a clear plastic holder featuring Woody and Buzz can be lifted to reveal the understructure wireframe.  Each DVD comes in different packaging (Woody is on the cover of TS1, Buzz on TS2, and the little squeak alien is on the special disc 3).  The first Toy Story  has indepth articles on the development, including the first attempt to match Tom Hank's voice to a Woody doll stand-in.  There is even a short 2 minute animation test that was used to help greenlight the project.  Also included was the first OScar-winning animated short: Tin Toy, the basis for Toy Story.  The Toy Story 2 disc features the animated short &quot;Luxo Jr,&quot; as well as sound and various features.  The joy of this set is Disc 3, which contains animated menus based on different scenes in the film.  You get to see Wire-frame models, animation tests, deleted animation, character 3-D renders, errors in production, as well as a redone &quot;crossing the street&quot; sequence that was intended before TS2 was remade for the big screen.  The most fun of all are the audio commentaries by John Lasseter and the other directors, writers, and producers on the film.  TS2 will make you laugh til it hurts.  There are even links to merchandise, posters, Tv previews, and other goodies you'll have to discover on your own, as well as a look into hidden gags in the two movies.",0.0,278,0.0,0.0,0.04044964831042499,0.05550241220710003,0.0,0.14487234332978213,0.07796496566852373,0.22029901052624018,0.0,0.08255836438916085,0.0,0.056074081510814715,0.0,0.03391488743525734,0.045457696867717036,0.04830702966250898,0.0,0.0,0.11210726368882135,0.10695301399721933,0.09022955357018891,0.1627255376975957,0.0987495618560034,0.0,0.05393228137080127,0.0,0.0,0.0539691838136957,0.046746202813766555,0.03867019847197827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17746199773143834,0.05667615182807308,0.10881749162524602,0.026459941198202643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057267465257454964,0.0,0.05783167787002966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03814198954837975,0.18453208764403892,0.25481775437241516,0.0,0.053748756738278315,0.0,0.11084594402485536,0.0,0.0,0.3594414657512986,0.0,0.05188127635864167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038917492666417,0.0,0.09748970547436314,0.5954128304241004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262663203872577,0.0,0.025553822991484194,0.0,0.18444216685759143,0.0,0.060224103404816674,0.0,0.0,0.17640808079601408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15087790315485528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054335632026233725,0.0,0.0509091880263494,0.0,0.0,0.1141019665793735,

He plays Jack Butler who designs and builds cars for a big Detroit auto maker.  Due to cutbacks, he is laid off from his job.  His wife, played by Teri Garr, has been a housewife to their three kids and hasn't worked in years.  Jack and her make a bet as to who will get a job first.  Of she does and Jack is forced to stay at home and watch the kids.  He obviously has no idea how tough the job is and the film goes through his transformation from an inept house dad to a growing into the role.  Some hilarious scenes include a trip to the supermarket gone awry, Jack's addiction to soap operas and his confrontations with his wife's smug boss played with oily charm by Martin Mull.  Teri Garr is very funny as is Ann Jillian as her best friend.  The real star is of course Mr. Keaton, who shows he cannot only be funny, but touching and caring.  a first rate performance.",0.95,188,0.0,0.09133845378907361,0.0,0.0,0.06673968593014713,0.29389189568485186,0.0,0.1675891659157282,0.06617206080301945,0.0628050366376848,0.0,0.08531503185093656,0.08721882789614019,0.051600483214368185,0.13832504257395728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13728155734930392,0.24758202109745883,0.05008149807076263,0.13421690039789366,0.08205634722801776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14224588881398473,0.0,0.3658967944143654,0.1767288037629526,0.0,0.42654006440201664,0.08819327976189793,0.0,0.13500155134835767,0.08623106376638567,0.24834382072285147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08239474547917883,0.0,0.0802171520790997,0.0,0.0,0.081777120008467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394802597318809,0.0,0.0,0.07420965952690323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24389689397974174,0.08358919996581865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038879374636055335,0.0,0.28062322049940863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07332751274177182,0.053679919942948566,0.08520109988282996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105258497890447,0.07745680144819928,0.10547966374455675,0.0,0.0,

I think Kong is TRULY AMAZING!!!I really enjoyed the all-action sequences in Skull Island because it developes the drama and the danger of this menacing Island!

This is one of the best films ever made.

It magically transforms into a character study so compelling you can't take your eyes off the screen.  Definately a film you don't just rent once, buy it and sit down to watch it uninterrupted.If a great movie stays with you after you've left the theater, this is one of the best.

I had, up to that point, seen only Kurosawa's samurai based films, but then I saw Stray Dog and was sold on the fact that the man truly was a master of not just samurai films, but cinema, as an art form, in general.I've not seen this film in about 8 months, so it's not exactly fresh in my mind, but there are two things from this film that will always stick with me until my dying day:-The final shot of the film, of the criminal behind the glass.  This was so haunting, so effective that to this day the thought of it sends shivers down my spine.  If this was Kurosawa's intention or not, I don't know.-The first, I think, 45-50 minutes, are based solely in Mifune's apartment.  The fact that you can stay in one spot for that length of time and still keep an audience's interest just goes to show the directorial and acting brilliance that Mifune and Kurosawa are so widely reguarded for.",1.0,183,0.07124670451171687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108993728284918,0.1443154460360672,0.17474684407196248,0.054863042238895814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15203032530186178,0.0,0.07218200215640493,0.0,0.08725809541006813,0.0,0.0,0.20223608890497113,0.08105000586906261,0.09836996308311713,0.06590713160485016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064258493299514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06738812595705145,0.2651697360078442,0.0,0.0,0.07907468316601159,0.0,0.13903007358704786,0.06612420457688847,0.0,0.0,0.08116206538308876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2104664207414065,0.0,0.22797221779648763,0.23634351784478286,0.05439390446632157,0.11617934956439227,0.08031321532065783,0.0723079542267591,0.08281488456783007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09410670351060353,0.2603040861675335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3399023238066059,0.37640563480395073,0.0,0.0,0.08871853203272217,0.06920292760981747,0.0,0.22910033415371459,0.0738463645542484,0.11811417491283595,0.08778749253773892,0.08998889793482387,0.07451711563301691,0.0,0.26359493757712005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0760702354413384,0.05179572810457291,0.0,0.056831676157161955,
1148502,B00152R4IS,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,29,39,1215907200,An awful decade to be young ... and the series lets you forget all that,"I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignor any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbiness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric.",0.7435897435897436,298,0.09657514823065336,0.06079662396679034,0.04096414991042317,0.0,0.04442321301526377,0.2934301106645709,0.19739161369811462,0.0,0.0,0.04180423509795152,0.0,0.05678731897667192,0.11610904416383201,0.034346269773004416,0.04603589862589264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624701134036009,0.0,0.10986355628017558,0.16667602086482466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04734079379653472,0.07832413251729908,0.09741916530373876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17971923569481926,0.0,0.055100800946444144,0.02679649992370396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047547990511696135,0.0,0.03862713875163494,0.18687925401777952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04778413976456325,0.06208335238482336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13065077013809692,0.0,0.2551239079286834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05470558164524004,0.06581982088161623,0.6493697729631726,0.11127714444876335,0.0,0.060129134677780506,0.046902400873953386,0.09261086694645385,0.025878856294970307,0.10009899618512962,0.24015624361557378,0.0,0.12198025461991051,0.05050410076718597,0.0,0.03573038268061045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05093233440559476,0.056718366386627105,0.0482600478247573,0.0996616220162737,0.0,0.09342002478292193,0.0,0.14041856823261528,0.0,0.0,

Robert got his practice playing African Americans in this film and then later used it in Tropic Thunder.

1687079,B00H9KKGTO,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,5,13,1388188800,A satirical look at the king of Wall Street hedonism and one of the best films of the year,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Anytime Martin Scorsese makes a movie, film lovers line up to see what's poppin' this time around.  Rarely does he disappoint and ""Wolf"" is no exception.  In an award-worthy performance, Scorsese regular, Leonardo DiCaprio gives perhaps his greatest performance as Jordan Belfort, a real life self-made man who skirted the law selling penny stocks in the early 1990's.  Fired from his dream job of being a Wall Street broker after the market collapse of 1987, he fumbled around until he answered a want ad for a stock seller located in a strip center.  He quickly determined this was an easy, if shady, way to earn a living.  Commissions on penny stocks was 50% of the sale.Belfort was a great salesman and started his own company using the haughty title of Stratton Oakmont, recruiting friends with no experience as salesmen.  His first partner was a stranger he met in a caf&eacute;.  Donnie Azoff (excellent Jonah Hill) was just as crazy as Belfort, but without the charm and sales skills.  Still he had connections as did many of his core crew.""Wolf"" earns its `R' rating as Belfort's success is played out in unconventional ways.  Often, he would reward his staff (mostly men) with booze, drugs and women.  Not just strippers mind you but prostitutes.  He even had 3 classes of whores.  If memory serves they were blue chips, NASDAQ and pink sheets (penny stocks).After Jordan's first marriage fails, he marries Naomi Lapaglia (stunningly beautiful Margot Robbie) who he oogled and pursued after a chance meeting at a party.  The Australian Ms. Robbie, in her first big screen role, pulls off a convincing Queens accent as well as her clothes.  She's very good and very good to look at.There are many good scenes in the film including a lunch meeting between Belfort and his first boss, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey again great in this brief appearance).  He gave Jordan some advice.  Drugs.  Another memorable scene takes place on Belfort's huge yacht which he named after Naomi.  Belfort had requested a meeting with the FBI after he discovered they had subpoenaed a list of attendees at his recent wedding.  Agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) was in charge of an investigation of fraud and comes to the boat.  Belfort pulls out the charm offensive and it appears Denham is lapping it up.  Belfort goes a bit overboard, however and makes some not-so-subtle hints of bribery.  It's a great piece of acting between the two and certainly a well written scene of which there are many.This movie doesn't pull many punches when it comes to debauchery, raunchiness and perversion so be aware.  There are many naked bodies (of both sexes) and piles of pills and crank.  It is also one of the most entertaining and funny movies I've seen this year.  The sets for the period look authentic and the soundtrack is a big plus.  The film runs 3 hours and while there was a scene or two that could have been shortened, the time went by quickly.  This is one of the best films of 2013.",0.38461538461538464,515,0.0,0.20741342233983073,0.0,0.03835203781131966,0.0909323910603348,0.3003193573893458,0.08081041505331972,0.20296813887349954,0.09015900549047057,0.057047637873453794,0.0,0.03874705997125439,0.03961169657674061,0.04687021675491249,0.031411162862272336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03695214202177716,0.09352261764704983,0.14992395769175032,0.04549047845609632,0.030478276665004692,0.0,0.09157721533227223,0.09456366600772208,0.14917032222279808,0.0,0.0267210172493877,0.4320610834349651,0.08026395125791659,0.0,0.258292481359426,0.0,0.06232630359850319,0.18393874184258788,0.0,0.11278895062538902,0.09141878928903088,0.04213152571577986,0.0642934526865401,0.0,0.0,0.2059151677352652,0.0,0.0,0.03957168536598104,0.04867349862690168,0.03996155496967225,0.0,0.0,0.0748415390613943,0.05271205222216598,0.3096701630022648,0.05030813597393402,0.05372630051651737,0.0,0.03343829082437989,0.0,0.065208041601433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03584984135791516,0.0,0.042667859550522144,0.0,0.06018787164651438,0.06740678789546098,0.0,0.0,0.022455053284386187,0.30065956739286703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600119685352148,0.06319014315569667,0.10594579370023868,0.0682994351228463,0.09103507752483368,0.0,0.08322943090530716,0.0689198030998545,0.06660550836369789,0.17065660323973855,0.0,0.04095548999081367,0.0,0.06950418689426995,0.038700012317133985,0.032928741856076006,0.03400050323456349,0.07509159083739755,0.06374224682568536,0.0,0.0718576803206085,0.03580763387939633,0.02628139788633228,

I kept hoping she'd hit him over the head with a roasted pig or something. Instead, she puts up with his mistress and her one stab at freedom (having an affair) only leads to more sorrow. Defeat followed by yet another defeat, ending with resignation to what her husband wants. Yes, it's all true, but the real Georgiana had an adoring public and was admired by many. There are hints of her spirit here, but in the movie it's more about how Georgiana was a victim forever. It's hard to like a movie when it's all about victimhood. You kept wanting Ralph Fiennes to get his comeuppance, but it never does. Instead, we're asked to feel a little sorry for him, even though everything in the movie is done according to his terms (eventually even his wife's love affair). The movie's ending moral seems to be: well, life was really bad for women, what can you do? Just bear up and suffer some more.",1.0,208,0.12927003957113326,0.0,0.10966459543548375,0.0,0.11892480849513844,0.0981922438430475,0.052843453375442974,0.0,0.05895667284802875,0.05595678830796644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18389590837895672,0.12324210826679173,0.06548352193291666,0.15344784967518613,0.0,0.0,0.1449822124607671,0.0,0.0,0.08924124356007379,0.0,0.07310893993505103,0.0,0.0,0.07315896375033296,0.06336771311798484,0.0,0.0,0.31491666240506244,0.16906510118372642,0.25335348210261904,0.07857670260255267,0.0,0.08018733989575548,0.0,0.11063223069152593,0.2510779707075736,0.0,0.06306405060187588,0.0599878871650712,0.07449215303109778,0.08079108534464582,0.0,0.19458994438566862,0.07763001251429713,0.19097110838596332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341043931022447,0.0,0.1072054353726335,0.049346157348467014,0.10539792133871709,0.07286015959432199,0.06559778566785246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07113943225223027,0.0,0.0,0.2511118573973724,0.0,0.059036975376648655,0.06611785345351666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24834563042409505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06278090510900881,0.0,0.03463997558995877,0.0,0.32145958545457476,0.0,0.0,0.13520387437741266,0.0,0.14348001740518784,0.0,0.0,0.07817416784709186,0.1363502931072205,0.0,0.19379452394247554,0.06670070953967132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18795636563351975,0.0,0.10311540829964935,
1014496,B000HEWER6,A1OZCK6PFT2FGC,6,12,1165104000,You too will not remember this film,"This is an example of a film hyped-up more by the people who created it than by an actual audience. This is the type of movie that you'll NEVER hear about within the context of film discourse (not even in that of cult movies), and the reason for this is that there is no trace of it in the minds of those who have viewed it; the people have simply forgotten about it. Even if this movie was merely a high school film project (as I had presumed), it probably received a failing grade. 'Head Trauma' seems to be more of a hastily-assembled portrayal of depressing inner city life in a dead end town from which there is no escape, and I suppose that's considered scary by some. WHAT was the deal with this movie?! It was almost as if the director's vision was to put the viewers to sleep as soon as possible - even the actors looked bored. The scariest and most unjustifiable aspect about this particular movie is that at one time, its shelf price was $25. I am not surprised whatsoever by the 'currently unavailable' status of this movie.",0.5,193,0.19066782270162821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693936391450152,0.09655292854066695,0.0,0.1957632872457032,0.05797239372174967,0.05502259212550682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423691731030183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21384261095664023,0.1804056061608781,0.0,0.04387568241188609,0.058792751045955854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719375779861587,0.0,0.1030899569621517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12022775734196507,0.1182729235396108,0.0,0.21757046068379085,0.21161677264111262,0.08127192786586483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12756084906959528,0.07633398278264036,0.2347285673957465,0.07708604323547172,0.0,0.0,0.14436971034471244,0.10168181742957977,0.31624693567193213,0.0,0.05181915377969302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634277947222451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06501401872396151,0.0,0.072003300593871,0.21657956123687994,0.36629926615261366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346556117808316,0.0,0.2384316387752234,0.06587497924985282,0.10536427715112114,0.0,0.0,0.0664733257448009,0.0,0.23514104110708134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06351971089046891,0.0,0.07242603074761501,0.12295911904479105,0.0,0.046204610541297986,0.0,0.05069695048883783,

The reluctant hero is annoying as all get out; ok, I get why he's apathetic, but after getting attacked and having his side kicks willing to die for him; this gets OLD.  True, his side kicks have little or no attracting value and I personally wouldn't enjoy hanging with any of them.I think the writer, himself, got pretty fed up with the ""full of hangups"" four heroes and started to write the bad guys better; they were certainly more interesting and even redeeming in some ways.Unlike Story of Saiunkoku and other animes, I'm not waiting with bated breath for the english version sequel to come out on DVD.",0.23529411764705882,135,0.0,0.12231287066810356,0.08241317433611624,0.0,0.0,0.2459722598758646,0.0,0.07480716363399446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909908114259833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11420513963221052,0.10895443788140699,0.0,0.11051375942992558,0.13412996481284523,0.0,0.32964913362256276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07878767656583062,0.09799571907890485,0.0,0.12705277945610574,0.19039567516089423,0.0,0.0,0.12052190948474553,0.0,0.1662807085362032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803240939651755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974898352382457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22067239874235065,0.07771148985161393,0.26855036790616854,0.07416748226220629,0.15841351954035304,0.0,0.09859374805223006,0.11292021675028263,0.1922677584927144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09937541212378098,0.10385359935055821,0.0,0.0,0.3732645281638676,0.0,0.11790352551668357,0.0,0.09435996471207135,0.0931589638716626,0.10412805832028336,0.0,0.3221034069428445,0.0,0.0,0.10160599622636922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11410808297748777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118744066901377,0.0,0.0,
1225682,B001P3SA9E,A2582KMXLK2P06,0,5,1280188800,pretty lousy,"There's two things you need to know right away- the first half of Passengers is NOTHING but lengthy love story segments involving Anne Hathaway's character and one of her patients.  She's a therapist trying to help the survivors of a plane accident cope with their daily stress, and she becomes really close with one of the patients.The second thing you need to know- everything taking place for the first 80% of film leads to an ending that's intended to shock the viewers.  It fails though, because for one thing it's poorly and predictably executed, and second of all, the weak writing you experience throughout the movie makes the conclusion incredibly underwhelming.A missed opportunity for a thriller pretty much sums up Passengers.  Movie writers need to understand that in order for a thriller to work, you can't revolve ALL the events around one unexpected twist at the end (which, in my opinion at least, wasn't that unexpected anyway).  You need to tell a solid story the entire time leading up to a satisfying conclusion.  That's how a good thriller works, and that's what needs to be accomplished in order for me to rate these kind of movies favorably.",0.0,197,0.0,0.0,0.11933801906642402,0.0,0.06470753394614505,0.17808950131662074,0.0,0.0,0.12831438479285978,0.06089269051213999,0.08650585807328197,0.0,0.0,0.05002930374478998,0.0,0.0712597694628292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06655074045191987,0.16002894241353124,0.24278285036278757,0.0,0.0,0.06516639121338665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567380044852162,0.0,0.0,0.08550788881427834,0.0,0.13089089864461156,0.0,0.04013033621044852,0.07806438619625143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810630444896321,0.0,0.08012509899343075,0.0,0.0,0.10390825627541643,0.08530998617506125,0.0795759539039051,0.06925913281079882,0.0,0.0,0.27221118988018184,0.0,0.22938997032421407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07741458297254865,0.0,0.0,0.18217481832911533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503847281608997,0.0,0.23968540347154577,0.4053779908765002,0.08104399831878849,0.0,0.0,0.06831875703507173,0.0,0.0,0.07290286714964508,0.42755199751768697,0.0,0.08883915559940739,0.1471300967667213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07029632642263131,0.0,0.0801528191415906,0.0,0.0,0.10226792091174325,0.0,0.28052783382001106,

531519,B00003CXPC,A1XD6U515FOYLP,1,1,1311379200,Replace the amount of blood shed with an equal amount of happy tears.,"Without a single shot being fired and with no endless car chases or agonizingly contrived kick-fights, Billy Elliot generates an emotional high, simply from a  plain, ordinary family living life with such great intensity, that it makes one want to cry at the happy ending. A happy ending. What a strange thing to find in a movie these days. The movie ends without generating hatred for anyone; even more strange.  The happiness comes only after sharing in the protagonist's heartrending battle, shared by many youths today, to be unconventional against the wishes of a conventional father. Unlike most movies with this theme, however, the father grows along with the son. The fact that the movie is English and you are not familiar with the cast makes the movie totally believable. One is not blinded by the celebrity of the actors and makes it easy to accept the ordinariness of the family, which is vital to the dynamics of the movie. Need an emotional high? Want to replace the amount of blood shed for an equal amount of tears, both happy and sad? This movie is for you.",1.0,187,0.0,0.09226351251158722,0.0,0.0,0.20224683884145656,0.14843418883130424,0.05991136491416554,0.0,0.06684223901923814,0.06344111426489801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13972597265178188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08218692838909568,0.0,0.0,0.15176614225990734,0.06778811199127655,0.0,0.0,0.07010777383177381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09091254782041502,0.0,0.16723933356226184,0.08133146364600446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09159704536160988,0.0,0.07353890546534354,0.08801317307919612,0.324770781385695,0.08888029967718253,0.0,0.0,0.08322922400200139,0.11723925662204612,0.24308872903361775,0.0,0.11949509207232921,0.08260534333640475,0.07437161320221876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09988659684028883,0.6335152353272253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854627529518114,0.0,0.24297027413522962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07323830232286437,0.0,0.08350729972756873,0.0,0.0,0.26636985497060467,0.0,0.11690728861002793,

1558404,B008JFUO36,A1SVYMPTQSA8AD,1,2,1376179200,NEARLY CLASSIC!,"Oblivion is only a imaginative, more expressive enemy boss away from being a certified classic. The visuals, sound fx, acting and score are all first rate. Even the idea of Cruise as a lone patrolman/repairman is well conceived, as his character slowly evolves from an optimistic boy scout into a reluctant revolutionary. My one gripe with the film is that after spending much of the movie building toward a confrontation with the enemy and the truth, which happens to be one and the same, the director elects to represent the big baddie as a faceless, featureless, expressionless machine. Cold, calculating logic is lethal to be sure but it's also not very interesting and does not give us the memorable villain that this movie desperately deserved. From the previews I had hoped that Freeman was the bad guy since we never get to see him in such roles and I can't help but think that this plot twist is probably what begin to calm my wild expectations. The ""scavs"" are human? Really? Wow. That could only mean that the real aliens must really be repulsive, menacing, mesmerizing and unforgettable. Right? Wrong. 2001 was a great movie but the whole computer/robot/intelligent machine as the villain is a let down of the lowest order.",0.5,211,0.0,0.0886150877865384,0.05970794928343306,0.08192741721108196,0.06474976181667606,0.213846866151303,0.11508451644117408,0.21678972413218217,0.0,0.18279728649460578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15018585798797596,0.0,0.07130627329531108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893696734330376,0.06659417119143603,0.08006668832160019,0.0,0.1953225928040487,0.07960973841143912,0.0,0.06733546516388247,0.079664210311216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204912895534348,0.06897037644689877,0.0,0.0,0.04365877250225098,0.08365998074842557,0.2409391506168942,0.03905766534681412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063091775005802,0.0,0.15596409956417848,0.0,0.07962788484415131,0.13860866207205916,0.0,0.11260320287812978,0.11673807162136138,0.0,0.11476983463771855,0.15867767337544914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549302068220282,0.07658223858483294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878101854161185,0.5746602634220472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544027851436878,0.0,0.1944686437240349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114116463791002,0.10415877696164329,0.0,0.0,0.08512536303176768,0.0742372353930459,0.0,0.0703422015161475,0.0,0.08020512654171845,0.0,0.0,0.10233466053633367,0.0,0.0,
1095748,B000UNYPGM,A2V0V7VVM9CT0Z,117,147,1235174400,Bad Packagaing Rears Its Ugly Head (Again)...,"This is not a review of the BBC show Absolutely Fabulous. I like the show or I wouldn't have purchased this set. This is a review of the packaging. And when it comes to DVD's the packaging and transfer are as important as the show itself at least to those of us who care about quality.I am amazed (though I shouldn't be by now) at how much time, effort, and money corporations put into the external packages of DVD sets and how little thought they put into the containers for the DVDs themselves (see Stargate SG1 Box Set...see Milestone I Am Cuba set...see The Wire box set...see the early Buffy and Angel season sets). I guess they assume (probably rightly I am sad to say if comments on Amazon are a guide) that for most consumers a sexy cover is more important than DVD substance. The recent Absolutely Fabulous DVD Complete set proves this point (if further proof is needed) once again.This Absolutely Fabulous box may be ""cool"" and ""sexy"" to some. But for someone like me who cares more about the DVD's than the sexy container it leaves much to be desired. All the DVD's in the set are (unfortunately) packaged in cardboard (very tightly in cardboard I might add) and inevitably get scratched when you try to remove them (quite a task given the tightness of the cardboard holder). Now you may want to spend new money on used looking ""new"" discs but I don't. That is why I will be returning my set to Amazon for a refund and urging consumers out there not to buy this set until WB changes the packaging to something that is more DVD friendly.",0.7959183673469388,283,0.10334989442723942,0.0,0.04383778483500239,0.0,0.0,0.20934282103665114,0.12674318068536436,0.07958388619103898,0.09427034964698354,0.1789472079780232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07351132087380646,0.049265316699135586,0.0,0.0,0.06328794440639322,0.4252415059855256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14269467435900363,0.0,0.05844974790014815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041909285023487286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12564232122704247,0.09775267152413239,0.09616326961902749,0.12284689993087809,0.17689836562520003,0.0573525485359868,0.0,0.0,0.09591923737304553,0.0,0.0,0.05886651843285933,0.15557239926266808,0.06206429288917367,0.0,0.0,0.1169261421488079,0.050883481823654375,0.0,0.08267366470871618,0.14284916629491085,0.07890335872524716,0.0,0.0,0.052444667348482334,0.0,0.05113619694550538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22490778782759052,0.0,0.0,0.20476563665727698,0.0,0.05286045549956298,0.0,0.11708635588346401,0.10565562151281864,0.44673625253486676,0.0,0.06271605752993693,0.0,0.05019260407584415,0.09910751882949886,0.16616554765798183,0.05356047014961853,0.2855591144241292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05223209146748416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10665288433448201,0.0,0.09997343908440982,0.05517343472795047,0.0,0.0,0.08243957066112179,

231394,6300267865,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,12,13,989884800,A Powerhouse,"Lightning in a bottle - that's James Dean at his quirky best in &quot;East of Eden&quot;. Fans may prefer &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; as Dean's ultimate showcase, but nothing tops this, his initial screen appearance. Here he's in a dynamic face-off with his thespic opposite - the classically trained Raymond Massey, as the father. They play off one another brilliantly. Massey seems genuinely perplexed by the eccentric Dean whose off-screen antics matched those on film. Fortunately, this combination deepens the movie's core, resulting in an uncommon emotional powerhouse, driven by Dean's intense expressive yearning. Brilliant too, is Julie Harris, still looking like a teenager at thirty. Watch her scenes with Dean, especially in the farm field, where she too appears fascinated with Dean, the person. Again, the results are electric. (Whatever happened to Dean's movie brother, that credible performer, Richard Davalos, whose subsequent career appears blighted by the shadow of genius.) Often overlooked but contributing greatly - Leonard Rosenman's fine dramatic score, alternately lyrical then jarring in the manner of the movie itself, and Jo Van Fleet's commanding turn, her scenes the only ones Kazan's camera does not allow Dean to dominate. The film has many emotional highlights, not including an over-wrought closing. Despite the latter, it's an intensity that endures. Director Elia Kazan may have been a treacherous friend, but his artistry with actors remains undeniable. The film however remains Dean's ultimate showcase. Don't miss it.",0.9230769230769231,237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18501837861050885,0.03394744400611199,0.05480779655325467,0.10324383733363696,0.12229652395932067,0.0,0.0,0.07883789404645665,0.08059715343652601,0.14304888623290127,0.19173505794625456,0.0,0.0,0.08210318131221957,0.0,0.0,0.19028866258434457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06572327330578072,0.05436873735152113,0.06762356429844361,0.16331151033694113,0.0,0.2627713598595332,0.0,0.0,0.2495044019887396,0.0,0.03824824965477925,0.07440321747426387,0.0,0.0,0.06221780949938263,0.0,0.08379432240027905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485525403913813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725219387343042,0.11119056980550968,0.051180495972212775,0.05465793263761995,0.07556858132475885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5053601847644821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08681546917182159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370665887648248,0.45076036587387547,0.0,0.0,0.08347734026287362,0.0,0.06428588149120365,0.071855286264332,0.0,0.07409092511006798,0.1652026068847581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873261182086029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19494324444205086,0.0,0.0,

The biggest problem is Mike White's character, an infantile gay stalker obsessed with the childhood friend who has moved on in the world. The premise is workable, but White's own script never develops him beyond a single defining note, which makes for an increasingly unbelievable lead easily outshone by the supporting players - not so much Chris Weitz as the object of his obsession but definitely by Paul Weitz as a spectacularly bad lookalike actor Chuck casts in a frightening autobiographical play and Lupe Ontiveros as the show's down to earth director. It does pick up as it goes along and it's not unwatchable, it's just one of those films that really offers too few reasons to see it.",0.3333333333333333,146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18369608989295216,0.15167172838054638,0.0,0.46127688583014903,0.0,0.086433128169059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14202654494040187,0.19036476648771722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06892282487820992,0.0,0.0,0.0924993623485687,0.0,0.0,0.09788034366023804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13057241133197384,0.09783501990023738,0.0,0.0,0.12386062238956277,0.0,0.2278493831671704,0.3878252322695469,0.12766732148412224,0.09741129420317247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11295277914481568,0.0,0.0,0.15972852638979104,0.11039591342025384,0.15244415813419313,0.08140095526644783,0.0,0.10132500430566624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10988485671997937,0.10863250604004426,0.0,0.0,0.13187155189733185,0.09119091023165436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13608700173547758,0.33565415492071143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.220684237017165,0.12301645309276678,0.0,0.10442069815283286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137716010199175,0.09657615976825551,0.0,0.07258125927270058,0.0,0.0,

344797,6302906652,AUTBHG6070SL4,4,8,1077321600,Compelling imagery,"This has my vote for best feature-length animation ever. Although mostly drawn, it includes a lot of processed live action. The imagery, in many cases, is a layered composite of ink wash, cel animation, and photography. All of the photography is heavily processed, with hand-drawn extras - it effectively extends the animation instead of competing with it. The main characters are all well drawn, and I am impressed with the motion. Even the cartoony characters create very natural-looking action.The only problem with this movie is that it took on a story so widely known and well loved. Tolkien purists will cringe at every detail lost; many were lost in reducing this to reasonable length and to the animation technology of its time. What's worse is that so many Tolkien fans have built up pictures of their own for the story's places and people. No director can hope to compete with the fan's personal fantasies. It is nearly impossible for an adaptation of such well-loved text to be considered on its own merits. It is almost as hard to look, today, at a movie made under technological and economic limits of an earlier decade.If you can watch this for just for itself, the rewards are significant. Bakshi communicates just with pictures better than most do with action, script, music and all the rest combined.

1138350,B0012Q3SZK,A1C1319ULO1EBI,2,4,1292025600,My Life In Hell,"HELP....why am I addicted to bad movies? I know there are better ways to use my time.  I could be helping the poor, saving the sea lions, or just doing the dishes...but instead I'm watching KINKY KILLERS.  What can be said about this pile of puss that the other reviewers haven't already said?  This reminds me of the slop I used to sit through at the triple feature drive-in when I was a teenager.  I used to eat that stuff up because it seemed a bit un-wholesome, naughty and subversive.  Actually it was really just crap but, being young, I didn't know the difference.  Now I know the difference and I'm still subjecting myself to this kind of torture.  Anyway, this turkey makes no sense whatsoever.  The acting is pathetic, the continuity doesn't exist, and you will hate everyone in it.  The ""rock star"" was a dufuss, the cops were unlikeable, and the women weren't naked enough to keep me interested.  Charles Durning is funny only because he looks like he's already dead and is spouting off some of the most inane dialogue this side of Ed Wood.  Unfortunately, he's only in it for a few seconds.  Michael Pare should know better, but when has he ever had a good role.  The satanic plot line unfolds so badly that you don't really care.  Even the ""kinky"" is a falsehood.  What was so kinky about it?  It says this is from the best-selling author Kenneth Del Vecchio.  I guess I can cross him off my book list, but then again, I've never heard of him anyway.  Besides that, he can't act (yes, he even has a part in this bomb).  I can't say that I was bored, just dumbfounded.  If that was the intended purpose then they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.  Hmmmm....I wonder if there is a re-hab group just for bad movie addicts.  My life is spiraling down to the darkest pits of hell and I don't know how to get out.  I always feel like I just need one more!  Help me please!!!",0.5,345,0.09755727549998182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482070836574062,0.03987980011781272,0.0,0.044493313336014605,0.08445873198716755,0.11998443525622612,0.0,0.05864491133100424,0.138782225615188,0.0,0.19767593515443524,0.0,0.11948148495940279,0.0,0.10941490921296512,0.0,0.0,0.0673484174123764,0.045122930523267414,0.0551737202093971,0.045193197441038044,0.0,0.05521147209022895,0.09564445817398094,0.0,0.2952296275792363,0.0,0.1275897393420169,0.0,0.05930012127411131,0.09227376921466429,0.1210312681232874,0.0,0.1948140324752303,0.16241405206534942,0.0,0.23796530809161506,0.09054309651702956,0.0,0.0,0.16670139398707307,0.04895092700762706,0.0585856749409977,0.036030431133067115,0.05916287486715663,0.0,0.1440945987079852,0.05540125520284529,0.0,0.18877973478125987,0.0,0.03977075462837075,0.10997194223963368,0.04950521613375057,0.05669872427541071,0.048270083690759406,0.0,0.0,0.10737475155369103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910783180098109,0.04989769993288169,0.0,0.0,0.19946753953008708,0.44512493011789145,0.05620439231380631,0.0,0.12148124366997014,0.09475875579797498,0.04677633959934039,0.1829942310846033,0.050558479728042206,0.2156431361777036,0.0,0.0,0.05101770551421572,0.0,0.2165624708273985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057295167513217435,0.0975016630580282,0.10067513738208932,0.0,0.0,0.052081039868157535,0.0,0.0,0.07781894651812564,

230873,6300262731,A28SC4ZQGE4E8T,1,1,1225324800,Remember The Alamo!,"Hadn't seen this movie in a few years (quite a few) and caught it on AMC just the other night during their Fear Fest '08. I taped it and have been watching it with glee every day too.David and Jack are attacked early in the movie by a Werewolf, David's life is spared by the patrons of the Slaughtered Lamb pub, but now he has inherited the bloodline of the beast, and is the last one apparently and needs to die in order for all the people he will kill (plus Jack) to cross over to  the other side, as they currently walk the earth in limbo.Jack wants him to commit suicide, but David seems to think he's going crazy, hallucinating, basically losing his mind.As many have stated, the tranformation scenes...especially the first time David turns are really good, there is some blood and gore, but it's not anything like in today's movies. Even seeing Jacks's tore up face in the first scene of him as the undead is not too bad, and he's more concerned about his would be girlfriend going off to sleep with some other guy right after his funeral ""love mocks me, even in death"" I believe was the line he used.To me there are so many funny scenes in this movie. David and Jacks relationship seems to get even better when Jack becomes a member of the undead....I love his lines when trying to get David to kill himself. ""Can I have a piece of your toast?"" And holding up the Mickey Mouse figurine and mimicking ""Hi-Ya, David!"" Plus his increasing decomposition as the movie goes along. The classic porn theatre scene is priceless with all David's fresh kills sitting there decomposing trying to come with ideas on how David should off himself.David has an insatiable appetite for people when he turns, and for his love interest the Nurse Alex whom he is frisky for throughout. While at the theatre I spoke of earlier he turns into the Werewolf again and this begins the final showdown outside the theatre that has plenty of action and special effects to finish out this classic.Very entertaining lighthearted, 80's horror movie that has a decent story and some very memorable lines/quotes to remember.",1.0,374,0.040201361333344746,0.05061565201223591,0.06820862809670605,0.0,0.036984124192064524,0.28500786122586524,0.09860190823623723,0.12382714400662216,0.03666957194472253,0.03480371899451905,0.0,0.04727774321154978,0.0,0.08578398233255784,0.0766535005690964,0.04072910838952118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526295024074372,0.0,0.09146586061327373,0.11101163084958744,0.0,0.09094385429995948,0.03724638784396352,0.0,0.0,0.15765251347491366,0.09781201924521493,0.3244216042673692,0.0,0.1051542529745339,0.23636926807306904,0.04887273840385501,0.0,0.19949805762905357,0.04778536678892657,0.13762094591753044,0.08923668630185688,0.0,0.039224257899221494,0.037310961388232824,0.138996753018897,0.10050005787043877,0.0915923210592713,0.040343355103970004,0.0,0.14847405009551493,0.048759625519769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06431731519661635,0.1555845484913287,0.0613841446497336,0.03277743190594173,0.0,0.0,0.1401863196806411,0.039782231844786846,0.10337381107805396,0.0,0.04424694276429294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036719518103627405,0.12337094006104933,0.04297681524628652,0.0,0.054797666907810495,0.4633942616878004,0.046321365010420223,0.0,0.0,0.11714444551088182,0.0385511489624303,0.0861807843419981,0.04166823441091257,0.28880193378038443,0.09906919154352065,0.0,0.08409341910232183,0.08126960144149734,0.02974699083642682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12445850566569738,0.0,0.0,0.04292306630388678,0.11690414569073451,0.043691163170037135,0.0,

Enjoy the magnificient acting, the superb cinematography, the pacing, the soundtrack and do your absolute best to ignore the plot holes, because there's loads of them. In all aspects save for plotting, this movie is a brooding work of art.Depends on your cerebral make-up, I guess, whether or not you are able to engage the ""Suspension of Disbelief"" button and ignore the obvious errors in the plot. If you are a right-brained plot fetishist, this is probably not the movie for you. But if you enjoyed Chris Nolan's previous works - Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins - odds are, you'll enjoy this one too.I had the chance to compare the normal DVD vs the Blu-Ray release and...well, if you are looking for a movie to show off your HD system, look no further.

Unfortunately, many only consider cinema art if it's bleak or message oriented. The Cohen brothers are once again attacked by pro critics for lacking substance, all style, etc. But oh what style. They don't appreciate the subtle satire and parody of early movies within this film. It's full of fun with lots of visual details and throw away gags. The settings, the acting, the voice-over, and the musical choices and timing were extraordinary, as were the directing and editing. Those are the elements of cinema. When all or almost all are synchronized well, you have a movie that's art. But not everyone is able to appreciate how all those elements come together in one movie. Nevertheless, the users on IMDB gave it higher ratings than the paid critics. They were appreciative. So was I.

1571554,B008N9AB54,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,2,4,1349395200,A Fun Movie!,"My kids have really come to like this series. Not only does it have great music, but the stories are fun and lively too. From a parent's perspective, I have to say that I love some of the messages that are shared within the series. Underlying messages of friendship and teamwork are things that I always try and have my daughters show in their daily lives, so anything that can reinforce this (without me telling them) is always a good thing in my book. This was a great movie (ans some great episodes as well), and when my kids saw that it was coming out on DVD they hoped that we would get it for our collection. Though I was used to the shorter shows, they did a great job on this movie and the songs are just as good as you find in the regular series as well. I will also put a plug in for the bonus feature on this DVD as your kids will love singing along playing Pirate-oke!",0.5,172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08102295098342037,0.0,0.1762383577231355,0.2276280017601385,0.2679954981800508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04950927631796798,0.0,0.07051906288136808,0.0,0.0,0.1636552533401926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09610370182396856,0.06438875369378523,0.07873085900528617,0.12897804397545107,0.26636836747154713,0.0,0.0,0.2258044989917341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17270714517130897,0.0,0.03971320317211008,0.11587942398214768,0.0,0.0679135394474251,0.06460082570769038,0.16044087638260915,0.0,0.07929224212886263,0.0,0.0,0.10282818641451831,0.0,0.0,0.2741568870408093,0.0,0.05568004032071915,0.07696620070834419,0.15942230977933453,0.0,0.07846294799540657,0.0,0.0,0.06887962491576331,0.0,0.0,0.07660990044914046,0.0,0.2824946547036572,0.0,0.0919386598343844,0.06357679086315193,0.14240434624289453,0.0,0.0,0.2846328047351773,0.2340125123823422,0.08020158999505733,0.08447750863172442,0.0,0.0,0.13349621463994787,0.1865185732786193,0.0,0.11539304368159735,0.08576503174645071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15451331985444364,0.0,0.0,0.08418559196854353,0.1468353352064853,0.0,0.0,0.07182984957770805,0.0,0.0,0.14863543698509668,0.0,0.07564761431754445,0.055522379884898145,
312084,6302426200,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0,0,1346803200,The great detective makes a pretty good film...,"I remember growing up on this cute little movie.  I got to watch this with my little ones last night, and I was really excited to do so.  It isn't as wonderful as I remember, to be completely honest, and there were some moments where my children were truly terrified (my daughter has this thing about children in peril) but overall this is a really good film.  It isn't particularly funny, so it isn't that type of cartoon.  Instead, it utilizes the best facets of Sherlockian wonderment to create a story that is a tad too copycat and yet completely forgivable.  From the aptly named Basil of Baker Street to the clever update on the Watson-esque character (Dr. Dawson), `The Great Mouse Detective' is fun and has charm and warms the heart, even after all these years.  The action scenes are well animated, especially the final one, which makes up for the seemingly lazy plot (Ratigan's scheme seems somewhat silly).  I also wasn't really a fan of the songs here, which is a shame since Disney is usually on top of those things.  Ratigan's theme song is like a poor man's version of Gaston's theme in `Beauty and the Beast'.  Overall, this can't touch `Feivel Goes West', which is much smarter and more engaging overall, but it is a fun blast from the past that one can still enjoy today.",0.0,230,0.07083055537994935,0.08917943631852226,0.060088201612551566,0.08244917506053169,0.0,0.25107688432350894,0.0579087182644122,0.10908517883730445,0.0,0.061320479304882665,0.0,0.0,0.08515718829773367,0.10076154819628017,0.0,0.1435207799775232,0.08407823228344923,0.0,0.0,0.07943968039987445,0.06701827868474573,0.0,0.04889769404517822,0.13104434140678706,0.0,0.06562420399173667,0.06776429361584119,0.0,0.13888354418997012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787363008629331,0.0,0.323298107591444,0.19653202781544218,0.0,0.0,0.06573797576094423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108073341622242,0.0,0.05231912094008073,0.0,0.08013499803490981,0.20923709485387232,0.0,0.0,0.23496304487520414,0.16222857558274267,0.1155007506624236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338753285396977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12939183024166723,0.07245552482508044,0.0757206122229265,0.0,0.14482155772370564,0.4082258887089492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879871609662587,0.0,0.1898018069403117,0.0,0.19570712462321227,0.08727472932925087,0.0,0.14816372832319524,0.0,0.0524110580324737,0.08318715443569097,0.0,0.0,0.07471001802926612,0.16639450065614755,0.0,0.0,0.2421477477540602,0.0,0.0,0.05149319134265939,0.0,0.0,

I go to a movie thinking I'm going to see the original story, and oops, guess what? It's changed so much I don't recognize it.Flicka was originally called My Friend Flicka and the orignal horse was a sorrel, not a black. The original character was a 10-year-old boy, not a female teenager. The ranch was located in southern Wyoming. The original story may be dated some, but that's no excuse to change it so much. The orignal movie starred Roddy McDowell as Ken, the original character.

Ginger Snaps is one of the best werewolf films since the early 80's An American Werewolf In London, The Howling and Wolfen. The other werewolf film that can even rise up and stand up to Ginger Snaps is Neil Marshall's Dog Soldiers.This film takes the standard werewolf story and gives it a tone that is very close to some of David Cronenberg's films. The story deals with a couple of teenage sisters whose preoccupation with goth and death adds to the film's subtext of teenage angst and alienation within the confines of the high school environment. The sisters are played wonderfully by Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins. Isabelle plays the title role of Ginger while Perkins that of the younger sibling Brigitte.The werewolf angle is used as a metaphor for puberty, especially the body changes a girl goes through towards becoming a woman. It is this use of a standard horror convention to explain the idea and concept of sex which makes this film very Cronenberg. Ginger Snaps is not all subtext and metaphors. This film has scares and blood aplenty. The make-up FX used for the werewolf is believable and there's not a CGI to be seen to give the effects that artificial look to them. These effects --- like those in Dog Soldiers --- owes much to those films listed above.It seems that the upsurge in horror films these past 5 years have come from low to mid-budgeted efforts. It just goes to show that throwing loads and loads of cash to make a horror film doesn't mean it'll turn up good.

Loggerheads takes head on: sealed adoption files, the conflicts that erupt in a religious family and a gay son and finds time to have a tender romance blooming under the balmy beach sun. This movie is not lite by any means, but really stirs up feeling of comparsion for Mark (lost and needing a mother), fustration (as Grace races to find him) and forgiveness (as Elizabeth learns the about the time she has wasted away from her ill son).Loggerhead is an ideal title, for a creature such as a turtle that is both strangely beautiful and secretive, yet relies on the mercy and protection of others to defend it from poachers and environmental destructuon.....so does children, adoptive or not, rely on loving partents to thrive.",1.0,209,0.2203672256805093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13515444207389116,0.3719750347725827,0.06005498388931723,0.16969228953726276,0.06700247262230395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052248032204410336,0.14006092247345717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10141996977724849,0.13590122606473246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14403097251671826,0.059573890049667184,0.0,0.4473665581818876,0.09606868286689983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04556524127362098,0.0,0.20955029770084307,0.04076321534280821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851643964258553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11752030149404542,0.16244763940535517,0.16824123871164717,0.0,0.0,0.07454989615210288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084780961321966,0.0,0.0,0.09512700619867659,0.0,0.06709373401334659,0.0,0.07852703847413064,0.0,0.1501890661128286,0.423355928164006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07044048146532415,0.07873456570679233,0.15227201122203005,0.2435527202506473,0.0,0.0,0.07682755364056221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370748266150357,0.07105593264790737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

What is really annoying is the attempt to convert people by tricking them into buying one type of movie and then giving them this.  They were both produced by ""Faith Films"".

I actually have nothing against God or people who believe in God, but I do have something against people who try to ram their beliefs down your throat.

How do we react to personal tragedy?  Even someone who is so internally wounded can barricade himself in fantasy in order to cope as proactively as possible.  David Tennant gives a very tender and nuanced performance.  Every time I watch it, I find a new aspect to admire.

I'm a HUGE  fan of the original,so I just could not wait to see P2.I finally found a  rental copy and P2 is quite disappointing compared to the brilliance and  creativity of P1.However,the second time I watched it,it was actually quite  enjoyable. The acting is pretty good (especially by Andrew  Robinson) and  it has a good story that's  &quot;refreshing&quot; to P1.A tormented boy  who's badly  deformed and is killed by bullies,then returns as Pumpkinhead  to exact his revenge.Very good. Pumpkinhead is still very scary and looks  cool. The photography is very dark and adds plenty  of suspense.The music  is good and the film is overall quite entertaining.The ending is actually  quite heartbreaking.Pumpkinhead is gunned to death just when he becomes  good.I hate to admit it,but I actually cried when he died.You actually feel  sympathy for him while he's on his rampage. P2 does have some  flaws,though.The human characters are quite under-developed and the  script  is a bit weak (though the story is strong  throughout).Some scenes are also  very comedic (like when the present teens are together early  in the  film.)It turned me off,because P1 was very scary and suspenseful and  P2,though scary in parts,is also a bit comedic is places,whereas P1 wasn't  one bit funny.I sometimes felt myself not liking the film,but giving it a  chance,it was fun to watch.Overall,P2 isn't nearly as entertaining as  P1,nor scary,but I still liked it.I actually  give it 3.5 stars (4 1/2),but  I oddly don't have that option.Rent P2 to kill some time.Rated R for some  violence and bad language.",0.6666666666666666,285,0.04835561208027172,0.0,0.0,0.11257515359519787,0.0,0.29384355838790305,0.11860184498506741,0.11170773467612047,0.0,0.0,0.05947194381132168,0.0,0.0,0.13757865686780132,0.09220152788805379,0.0,0.0,0.05922264954470544,0.0,0.0,0.13725897823262662,0.0,0.0667643480185893,0.0,0.0,0.22400632991502223,0.0,0.0,0.04740749773285395,0.0784344924738758,0.14633464570079452,0.0,0.06324161790523457,0.09477109112354634,0.0,0.0,0.08998623148748347,0.0,0.3862490719994512,0.24150830958963854,0.0,0.09436063537172173,0.044878937314366665,0.0,0.0,0.055085233432135276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04761498639150396,0.0,0.07736313001700496,0.08020395851929978,0.03691750463310548,0.03942584852012448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18226315130434637,0.0,0.05261521456937555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044167528519009784,0.19785987743396358,0.10338805142756267,0.0,0.06591256206292172,0.4180401934513584,0.0,0.0,0.06021385759112487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10024003727319943,0.24049462760739376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29326180936791485,0.14312290944720357,0.056791391065283546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14970307025570678,0.0,0.04677582754668252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03857203648872499,

134578,0792833201,A190KRNWI4E0H,1,1,1199577600,It Says Things Only a Child Can Understand,"1982 was a banner year for Speilberg, who has a production credit on ""Poltergeist."" ET was released about a month after this fine ghost story, and both movies have withstood the test of time. Although the film was directed by Tobe Hooper, Speilberg's presence on the set is undeniable. Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams play ""yuppie"" parents to three children. The youngest, played with cuteness by the late Heather O'Rourke, is abducted by a supernatuarl force and suspended into a ""phantom zone"" somewhere within the confines of the cursed house. The classic ""They're here"" became a well known tagline for the film. The cast is excellent, of course, but perhaps the best of the lot comes in the form of a creepy seer played by Zelda Rubenstein, whose shrilly, infantile voice provides enough goose bumps to last the duration of the film.Although I can not say that ""Poltergeist"" is genuinely terrifying, it is good fun with a spooky premise. I liked when Jobeth Williams plunged into the pool and the corpses began to surface, and there's a few touching moments, too, especially considering the unfortunate and premature deaths of two of the children in real life. The music is both whimiscal and eerie. This film also spawned two sequels, neither of which come close to entertaining viewers as this offering.",1.0,221,0.0666098399184668,0.08386533107542773,0.0,0.07753611873762478,0.0,0.23611548691527848,0.0,0.05129245606541626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08008276442266166,0.04737863877593598,0.2540151493756795,0.06748426669814395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520989305169727,0.0,0.09196786768817279,0.0,0.0,0.06171372932512386,0.0,0.0,0.0653038127131641,0.054021743940478095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08263733641088318,0.15835163420774617,0.22802484475547471,0.036964179770766124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08079007134672023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053283843222477076,0.33144278034963653,0.10170770125785139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120850361319081,0.0,0.04539726640559311,0.6398335895107776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469907571965125,0.0638755946538192,0.10709503469551032,0.06904030937613809,0.14723612059374958,0.0820741234960662,0.16826451488411226,0.0,0.0,0.14786382092192948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025812962415236,0.0,0.0,0.06873864353450371,0.07590614261502332,0.0644336872370911,0.0,0.09684953658280845,0.0,0.0,

I had to get it!The quality is not great. The sound is 1.0 and terrible. and there is no bonus features...well, except trailers to NRNS 2 + 3 plus King of the kick boxers... but I dont consider trailers any kind of bonus.After seeing the movie again, and refreshing my memory.. I gotta say... the acting is not great, the movie is pretty well dated, and the plot goes from one thing to the other with no preperation ... but theres just somthign about the movie thats terrific!Jason is a kid from L.A who's father is a Karate intstructor. His father is asked by a group who are trying to take over all martial arts training dojo's to front for orginized crime.... that bit is kind of corney to me... then Vanne Dammes charactor prooves that Jasons father is no match for him. and the buisness is closed down , and they move to Seattle. Jason is a Bruce Lee fanatic, and learns that Bruce Lee is buried in the Seattle area.... and after a confrentation, he asks for Bruce Lee's help! And wullah, Bruce Lee's ghost comes to train Jason! And Jasons martial arts skills improve from beeing taught by the best!A great thing about this movie that I have to mention is the way the plot goes from one thing to the other without previous information, but yet, either accidently, or ingeniously able to let you know straight away what has happend! like for exsample, Jason has a girl freind, and he speaks about what they did and how they met previously, without you witnessing any of it... but yet, you understand what had happend before hand very easily! I dont know if there was a great number of deleted scenes? or unshot scenes? But it works out very intresting, and easy to follow and figure out what has been happning! Which like i said, the creators where either geniouses, or accidently did that without knowing?!The movie is good IMO. And its also the first movie Jean Cluade Vanne Damme appeared in I belive? I dont know why its not available on DVD yet for regoin 1, but its on region 4!I honestly beleive this is a movie that should be remade! I think with todays advancments, this movie beeing made again would really be worth it, not to say theres anything wrong with this version, but I reckon it would be a movie that should be seen again, and the things that could be done for it would make it incredible! I think so anyway!",0.0,488,0.10312127256721482,0.08655677775090258,0.02916054040671713,0.08002444527648878,0.0,0.31331959593788045,0.056205693415123124,0.026469279158745192,0.0,0.14879279680054328,0.0,0.08084868907224783,0.041326409571887913,0.19559654765951542,0.06554178153216354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122880652494429,0.0,0.0,0.07820693653204647,0.1898386897572737,0.15898810873489466,0.038880300220913454,0.03184713805380312,0.13154285660661968,0.07781380709365592,0.10109936127628436,0.05575543581610169,0.06934833293111986,0.0,0.04495552730447208,0.0336841823138,0.0835762573023429,0.032512143788433444,0.06396703026674573,0.0,0.31379030414736875,0.2289027123938742,0.1318659515816766,0.033538295353838926,0.06380470198769873,0.0,0.0,0.03915753261313391,0.0,0.0,0.25390239668921255,0.0,0.0,0.03384728113744457,0.15616256628895578,0.1099877080643448,0.11402653399993701,0.10497175388735132,0.05605200715466618,0.0,0.13954307655720527,0.07990990687611096,0.06803077039078101,0.0,0.0,0.03783289001275703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031396643540693575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18741670954513176,0.3301837189138178,0.0,0.0,0.04280323319845603,0.06677542967925507,0.09888828159251091,0.09210998352453204,0.0,0.26593226314737023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06948873076035453,0.05086971267236258,0.0,0.042728373178834204,0.0,0.10876933113640923,0.0,0.13741665116461818,0.0,0.03917107958679443,0.0997522863321675,0.0,0.0749682589853769,0.11207302928567768,0.10967627312484951,

1260907,B002BWP3W0,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,3,4,1294358400,Dyno-Mite and Outtasite! One of the best movies of 2009,"Black Dynamite is one of the best films of 2009. A hilarious send up of the blaxploitation films' of the 1970's, it surpasses the quality of its 1980s contemporary I'm Gonna Git You Sucka and is on par with the Naked Gun and Airplane! parodies from that decade. You'll be talking about this movie for days and reciting the one-liners verbatim. This is one of the most fun movies I've had the pleasure to watch in a long time.Michael Jai White is Black Dynamite, a former government agent now neighborhood enforcer out for revenge when finds out his brother has been killed by The Man. That's the premise of this movie and that's all you really need to know. On his quest for revenge as he cleans up the streets there are tons of jokes based on the gaffes you'll be talking about for weeks on end. It's a conspiracy that leads all the way up to the White House and the President in a Kung-Fu climax that has to be seen to believed.Black Dynamite was one of the best movies of 2009. Forget that Avatar nonsense, THIS movie should have been nominated for some Oscars! Everything from the set design to the music is the highest quality. For a film costing about $3 million dollars the set design, costumes and cinematography and production values had the feel of a big-budget period film, and the quality was on the screen in every frame. My only complaint about this fantiastic film is there wasn't enough Salli Richardson in it!In their portrayal of the bad acting of those 1970s flicks, the entire cast gives a great performance with several standouts. Michael Jai White is awesome as Black Dynamite. This is gonna be his signature role; he takes his craft to the next level in this one. Tommy Davidson is hilarious as Cream Corn. Byron Minns steals scenes as Bullhorn. Minns feels like he was channeling the spirit of the late Rudy Ray Moore, in some frames it was like Dolemite was speaking through him! His rhymes and his one-liners are unforgettable. Kym Whitley is hilarious as Honey Bee; she channels the late Lady Reed in her portrayal of the character. Nicole Ari Parker disappears into her character and Salli Richardson is a delight to watch as Gloria.Director Scott Sanders crafts a beautiful film that looks like it could have come from the 1970's. Cinematically, there's no distinction between this 2009 film and the classic blaxploitation movies that came from the late Samuel Z Arkoff's American Interantional pictures in the 1970's. Everything here is so period accurate it's not funny! White, Sanders and Minns must have sat down and meticulously studied every blaxploitation film from the 1970's frame-by-frame. I've watched dozens of Blaxploitation films from Dolemite to Foxy Brown to Black Samurai, and all the gags the in-jokes made about the genre and this film are right on the money.Black Dynamite is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Video. I highly recommend you pick this one up NOW!",0.75,505,0.15121435903795646,0.0,0.07696846800518749,0.0,0.0,0.2297218638515961,0.07417671371986598,0.13972991156096431,0.0,0.10472923075922082,0.0,0.0711326522225589,0.07271996994427955,0.0,0.0576652609371085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20030587648354958,0.0,0.12526853853644335,0.167857947619492,0.0,0.0,0.028933654888946427,0.0684624888989857,0.059299792308422396,0.0735824922630443,0.09152153680925035,0.07367510896405395,0.03955297143251324,0.1778170001337429,0.0,0.0,0.18759918764661862,0.03594820359671634,0.22431530648036718,0.10069709985627338,0.03867296213660756,0.0,0.08420540386126511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03632325826897733,0.06701685985048639,0.11004337080177991,0.0,0.02977966501939823,0.03434891043220273,0.024192468289454767,0.2675288824176453,0.1385350711584532,0.17260573943396898,0.034091433309714515,0.0,0.0,0.05985513415456594,0.0,0.0,0.03328630109817742,0.0,0.0,0.03916526849701551,0.0,0.027623534179262523,0.06187338606290124,0.0,0.0,0.16489380067569154,0.5664822229933252,0.03484685735755978,0.0,0.0,0.08812598208256256,0.0,0.16208122851370316,0.031346378081297865,0.1671240737860309,0.0,0.0,0.1265243966583841,0.0,0.11189104058790338,0.07103765978232261,0.03759346681118949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031209412711189714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04397260409398561,0.0,0.12061983135998482,
994652,B000FS2W6M,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,75,78,1156550400,The greatest set of Halloween specials ever assembled by one TV series,"This DVD contains the Halloween special episodes of Roseanne from seasons 2 through 8. Oddly enough, the Halloween special episode from season 9, ""Satan, Darling"", is not included. Many people who hate season 9 of Roseanne - and there are a lot of you - will cheer at this news, but I, personally, am disappointed since that particular episode was officially as much a part of the Roseanne Halloween collection as any, and also because it is interesting to contrast the writing, acting, and overall atmosphere of season 9 with all of the others. I include a brief synopsis of all of the Halloween episodes included on this DVD below:Season 2 (Boo) - The Conners are welcoming the neighborhood kids to their ""Tunnel of Terror"" as Roseanne and Dan decide to find out who can scare the other the most. First Dan pretends he cuts off his hand while repairing the garbage disposal. Roseanne thinks this is on the level and comes to his aid until she realizes it's a stunt and he is using fake blood. Later Dan hears Roseanne on the phone talking to Bev about her moving in with them. A horrified Dan nearly has a heart attack and Roseanne is declared the winner.Season 3 (Trick or Treat) - DJ decides he wants to dress as a witch for Halloween this year, and this has Dan very upset as he believes it might mean DJ is having trouble with his own gender identity. You see, Dan believes only girls should dress as witches. Meanwhile, Roseanne decides to find out what it's like to be one of the guys by dressing up in Dan's clothes. She then goes to the Lobo and enjoys conversing with a group of men there on a variety of subjects. You even see Roseanne trying to make conversation with ""another"" man at the urinal. Unfortunately, the restroom scene has been cut from most (if not all) syndicated showings of this episode. We also get another look at Crystal's desperation for male companionship as she shows an interest in Roseanne ( alias Bob) after ""Bob"" pays her some well placed compliments.Season 4 (Trick Me Up, Trick Me Down) - Dan and Roseanne scare the wits out of their next-door neighbor, the snobby Kathy Bowman, when they have her convinced that Roseanne has murdered Dan in a fit of homicidal rage. Roseanne then spends the rest of the episode expecting Kathy to retaliate for the prank that has been played on her. When she doesn't, Dan finally has to fake a retaliation at the end of the episode so that Roseanne will stop obsessing over this. Meanwhile, Jackie flirts with a stranger at the Lobo Lounge costume party who turns out to be her ex-boyfriend Booker (George Clooney) in a Moose costume. This is George Clooney's final appearance on Roseanne. Booker hadn't appeared on Roseanne since the season one finale, ""Let's Call It Quits"". There are some good gags in this episode, but it wasn't as good as the previous two Halloween specials. This is the only episode with video commentary.Season 5 (Halloween IV) - Roseanne sends everyone to a party while she stays home, depressed over the absence of Becky. She is subsequently visited by the ghosts of Halloween past, present, and future. She has her normal smart-mouth retorts even to the ghosts though, comparing the ghost of Halloween present to a big piece of candy corn.Season 6  (Halloween V) - Roseanne believes that Darlene and David are dating other people, and this is all part of a prank the two are playing on her in which Roseanne finally gets bested. To me, this was the best Halloween episode since the one during season three.Season 7 (Skeleton in the Closet) - Dan and Jackie's husband, Fred, convince Roseanne that Fred is hiding his true sexual orientation when all of the guests at Leon's Halloween party at ""The Lunch Box"" seem to know Fred a little too well. There are also some hilarious scenes with Jackie speculating that her mother wears a wig and may be bald. This leads her to the conclusion that she may go bald as she ages too. Jackie then puts on the wig and begins doing an imitation of her mother, even getting the voice down pat: ""Oh Roseanne! Roseanne, a woman your size should not wear horizontal stripes, you should wear black! Or stay at home!"". For some reason, this particular episode isn't aired much in syndication, not even during the Roseanne Halloween episode marathons.Season 8 (Halloween: The Final Chapter) - This episode begins with Halloween at the Connors. They have a seance around the table and Dan and David fool some trick or treaters. Then Roseanne and Jackie play with the ouija board. They ask when is Roseanne going to have her baby, and it spells out the word ""NOW"". The scene suddenly changes and Roseanne is in the hospital. Jerry Garcia appears from beyond the grave via a videotape with a message especially for Roseanne. Meanwhile the doctors and nurses are dancing around Roseanne's bedside as though they are accompanying vocalists of some type. In the end, we see that all of this strange stuff was Roseanne halucinating while she was having the baby. Roseanne and Dan's new son Jerry Garcia Connor is born, which is particularly strange since the show has been saying the baby is a girl for months. This is the second poorest of the Halloween episodes, the poorest being the one from season nine that is not included in the DVD. It gives a foreshadowing of what we see a lot more of the following year - the absurd and the bizarre replacing the great original comedy of the earlier years.If you are a Roseanne fan, I highly recommend this DVD set. If you are not familiar with Roseanne, some of the unexplained subplots in the Halloween episodes may leave you somewhat confused.",0.9615384615384616,990,0.017476192074837978,0.022003455286607285,0.08895423286005788,0.06102864556294362,0.03215521249346737,0.21239588314242286,0.14287956345504363,0.14803165670647048,0.1434677869649317,0.045389244883287376,0.021493743298818962,0.06165723451841887,0.021011036427163513,0.024861137408711015,0.03332253572326416,0.01770561238834909,0.0,0.0,0.08217966497464915,0.07840136819963137,0.0,0.019880855962980604,0.07238786892743464,0.08083220823487813,0.019767393603831694,0.03238323312773548,0.016719645987434927,0.0,0.13706827406778982,0.042520491318270105,0.07051569998328594,0.2341570602058293,0.0,0.06850240211488443,0.0,0.04958914973794175,0.14092825887800822,0.0,0.17947825680077895,0.07758530647765814,0.0,0.0,0.01621968774417544,0.0,0.02184451292970669,0.059725029538404285,0.017537919099161883,0.04197962695680605,0.0,0.0,0.03954379886088785,0.0,0.0,0.08387937996380614,0.29952713133885106,0.12008113158381145,0.05699555206186858,0.039400255400186615,0.05320952198136904,0.04062753047405638,0.08646994801001517,0.04493829357986514,0.0,0.0,0.07606261662839063,0.0,0.22632101847703395,0.023083549440671598,0.01596257763396223,0.12513987266564927,0.0,0.0,0.11910722925439454,0.5707611074834513,0.04027331638738966,0.02121023681047688,0.08704751283739937,0.06789948606542978,0.0670352706105307,0.17795496170401176,0.0,0.19314914485607443,0.04306700476526954,0.04414697565845562,0.03655679050955542,0.017664615295739906,0.051726022031462156,0.0,0.0,0.0634108310225107,0.036866762317203684,0.0,0.03493245957280865,0.07213887550807717,0.039830461373993514,0.050715727389096514,0.03731872385851468,0.15246045681106327,0.0,0.09758218386170418,

556117,B00004WMP2,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,23,24,1257552000,Not enough and too much at the same time,"When I ordered this, I did it for a number of reasons. First, my wife and I are big fans of 70s kitsch and the Brady shows are the epitome of it. We already own the 5 seasons of the original series, and were looking forward to a fresh dose of camp. We've both read Maureen McCormick's autobiography and it provided a lot of information regarding what was happening behind the scenes in the lives of the cast members.Well, on the one hand we were deeply satisfied because the show exceeds all expectations in terms of trashy glitz, over-the-top acting, and ""what where they THINKING?"" moments. The show made Ed Wood's body of work look positively brilliant by comparison. As others have said, it's deliciously bad. The bonus interview really doesn't provide a lot of new information, but it was interesting to learn exactly what mistakes were made post-Brady that derailed most of the careers of the participants. Susan Olsen in particular knowingly discusses the irony in the fact that the last pooch that played ""Tiger"" on the Brady Bunch went on to have a more successful career than any of the humans on the show.On the other hand...The show lasted less than a season and, depending on the source, ran either 9 or 10 episodes. This collection only consists of two episodes. There is no reason given as to what happened with the remaining episodes and apparently there is no plan to release them to the public. Even the most addicted fans of campy trash would likely be unable to handle more than a couple of episodes in a single sitting, but it was quite a letdown to know that this set would only be a teaser and we'd be unable to acquire the remainder of the series.Caveat Emptor - buyer beware. The two episodes provided are enough to sate your curiosity and interest in just how bad television can get, but we still wound up feeling we got less than half of what we wanted.The old cliche says that half a loaf is better than none at all, but nonetheless, we thought we were paying for all the episodes, and not just enough to leave us wanting.",0.9583333333333334,369,0.0,0.0,0.09119845266133697,0.0,0.0,0.18146200271979676,0.0878905568745218,0.05518775872394285,0.032686072270024805,0.09306873361123653,0.044072014736747496,0.0,0.0,0.10195342886682952,0.034163227527291375,0.03630461196330271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04018967527709776,0.0,0.040764857233024664,0.049476091433965426,0.0,0.040532207447691475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05812431689041076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04356358077783145,0.0,0.13336959467148807,0.0,0.061335433515702205,0.11931405070654816,0.0,0.06992647366403537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07192152788319742,0.0860774557582615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03528535049390641,0.08139872244328981,0.02866518889148263,0.35661353726950024,0.16414753283289502,0.029216744327380095,0.08078856309426818,0.03636796073312867,0.04165251945361833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03944029592441085,0.0,0.09695590007084615,0.0,0.18932738090002568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20298498438650947,0.12211217678498275,0.533528962430259,0.0,0.043490696631359016,0.0,0.0696125172076851,0.03436324926230396,0.057614076110630345,0.0,0.21782429947533422,0.0,0.09052151292367945,0.03747907908981694,0.0,0.07954652105791604,0.0,0.0,0.3900637093000534,0.03779687115341252,0.16836273548945369,0.17906884013640537,0.036979430947459334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02605114507794789,0.07788978388349092,0.0,

I streamed these four movies online so I did not get to watch any special features, including the 2008 cast reunion at ComicCon :( The four movies in this collection are all SUPER-cheesy flicks given the MSTie treatment. Werewolf is the kind of movie that after about 2 minutes you would walk out of in a theater...bad acting and thick accents, horrible plot and special effects...perfect for Mike, Tom Servo and Crow tee it up and drive it out of the park. Laserblast is ""like Porky's, without the charm"". I noticed a continuity error in Laserblast when Billy finds the laser, he puts the necklace on, but when he is shooting it is back in his hand. There are lots of laugh-out-loud moments so definitely worth checking out...I could care less about the Joel versus Mike argument, they are both VERY funny and make these stinkers smell like roses.",0.0,165,0.1832126854428455,0.11533725753349706,0.07771307680571346,0.0,0.0,0.2319442404420409,0.22468294354457663,0.0,0.08355849811060709,0.0,0.11266545976184275,0.0,0.0,0.06515829833393152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421106023217742,0.06324020608001438,0.08474091997598175,0.10361631558107341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18481386998516963,0.0,0.0,0.0897686191949655,0.0,0.0,0.2272968729577189,0.0,0.26132928337161654,0.15250689648745028,0.0,0.0,0.17004004853742383,0.0,0.0,0.10435514215592993,0.0,0.0,0.0676651947455622,0.22221590603835215,0.0,0.09020327888343589,0.0,0.07327953362037062,0.20258775891513062,0.13987528794903714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626051102477366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1673446196050255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1248667629304285,0.3959740305744034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897853097062472,0.08784602428942642,0.04909477070298793,0.0,0.05062225994159921,0.0,0.0,0.095811314783934,0.09259401566966576,0.0,0.10758733908520256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1890680339581995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09955851081919137,0.07307203946015091,

It is very well written with top-notch performances.  The whole cast is wonderful.  I just have a doubt about Ron Rifkin in the role of Uncle Saul.  He is a great actor, but he was so good in Alias as the bad guy, it took me a while to get used to him in this new role.I was also a bit disappointed with the arrival of Rob Lowe as Calista's love interest...even though I like Rob Lowe (and loved him in The West Wing); I wanted to see the relationship between Kitty and Matthew develop.  They had great chemistry.  I felt with the arrival of Rob Lowe, they were playing the ""known-actor"" card too heavily; and this show does not need that.  It would have been nicer to see new faces getting their chance in this show.Wonderful show that is not medical, criminal, or reality.  Thank you ABC for daring to put out so many different types of shows out there.Keep it up.",1.0,190,0.07692180553850587,0.0,0.0,0.08953959737850331,0.0,0.1558107810356826,0.0,0.11846623069161466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18092369258161517,0.0,0.0547133943432775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08627129372318876,0.0,0.0,0.1593083193735327,0.0,0.08700657444628958,0.07126772098557585,0.14718370590236865,0.08706610753228808,0.0,0.18715478466815968,0.1551881250302701,0.0,0.2012035097961936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2862916258047821,0.0,0.17555046709513591,0.17074663153057412,0.0,0.07505220317038175,0.07139127684165815,0.08865272925749584,0.09614905629708545,0.08762696679500086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12306558405546632,0.21264106464686836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15613517655411666,0.0,0.15223967549149897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16739555676613926,0.0,0.0,0.30480810011873627,0.14051920319882721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10485056570336093,0.3324992186487496,0.08863189985196561,0.0,0.0,0.07471523317155321,0.1475285356227171,0.1236745718511134,0.07972853948681007,0.21253744661485996,0.09478013721449335,0.0,0.0804527187228797,0.07775115407708283,0.11383655521025425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113489224810289,0.09035200524329223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16776443004448252,0.08359923757927895,0.0613585592730064,

It would seem that Frank's wife was the glue who held the family together, and when all of the kids bug out on a planned visit home, he decides to set out on a trip around the country, dropping in on each of their lives in order to help put things right. But their relationships aren't as simple as they once seemed, and Frank's paternal intuition is telling him that his sons and daughters are hiding something from him, and if the Goodes want to become the family they once were, the truth will have to come out before Frank returns home. The supporting players, in this case the adult children, are all beautifully cast. There's no stupidity or attitude in its form, just pure feeling. If you come from a family of secrets, which may be the majority of us, this is a good movie as long as you are not expecting a straight out comedy.",0.6666666666666666,190,0.07745322514152735,0.0,0.13141291870101304,0.0,0.0,0.15688721057116717,0.18996958174326836,0.23856932564674624,0.0,0.06705395523034287,0.0,0.09108680819995553,0.0,0.11018277120928212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329701107180998,0.0,0.07176007895519529,0.0,0.08766760974583496,0.15186918073557976,0.06281591880541033,0.0781301264518815,0.0,0.20259353813151262,0.3035977145947438,0.0,0.14651702776677197,0.19217966084178498,0.0,0.08838163480713819,0.04298156160503409,0.09904302945544222,0.07557070649639541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05721096822750578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796895711483844,0.06195789556870259,0.21411011011934022,0.17739697679338512,0.06315004588827852,0.0,0.07860692359921573,0.0,0.30658286759567843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10557493307373897,0.40919549299596625,0.1784884388996608,0.0,0.0,0.07523140851707093,0.14854774669409163,0.08301932411151557,0.0,0.21400577623500555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05731150145469527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097620830798173,0.0,0.07992857571971261,0.08826286868100326,0.07492281756542084,0.08269694875835312,0.0563078140630781,0.08417678868245788,0.1235649182299271,

She gets sent into a geisha house to live as a servant to geishas, who were basically high class prostitutes for their age.  There, she works and slaves, always under the thumb of the hen of the household, Hatsumomo.  Then she blossoms and her beauty shows thru until she is met one day by the Chairman, a very rich, handsome, and eligible patron of geishas.  She is rescued from her servitude by a rival geisha house and is pruned to become Japan's next great geisha.  She accomplishes this, only to lose many things in turn, such as her old friends, her family, and most importantly, her sense of self-worth and self-respect.  Later, a world war upsets everything and things begin anew.  At the end, she encounters again the Chairman, and they finally reveal their hearts and histories to each other.  This movie is a potpourri of sadness, melancholy, drama, frustration, tragedy and only the occasionally happy moment.  The characters all have one of two flaws; either they are too innocent to keep away from evil, or too evil to leave the innocent alone.  Even the setting is depressing; overcrowded cities, poor countrysides, and of course, a male-dominated society with no sense of justice but a burdensome sense of honor.  All in all, a sad story meant for rainy days.",1.0,237,0.0,0.0,0.1365765320566341,0.0,0.0,0.298928274977531,0.04387423656197433,0.08264781340626608,0.04894984801737816,0.0,0.06600115196960628,0.0,0.0,0.038170729161443026,0.15348599685783726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06018705705689315,0.0,0.0,0.07409416268125614,0.09928505771337096,0.0,0.0,0.05134126151750153,0.0,0.0,0.043522764901134055,0.0,0.45756423373067956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06657699478620281,0.0637882123439749,0.15309069685046353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06707826540641817,0.0,0.0,0.06445372729830129,0.07927861495253723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609503500373427,0.0,0.29669753027244905,0.0,0.08750853773883342,0.12098694062527057,0.054463752508470915,0.062377776073917895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4864770835272653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05736932456555252,0.0,0.0,0.28351601917081515,0.12366786177027601,0.0,0.0668245177617937,0.05212498628273886,0.15438463956854473,0.057520937276258295,0.0,0.2075870666093333,0.13224648153979307,0.06778138197994445,0.0,0.054242992596027884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06303396019806133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05191117533012207,0.0,0.07802709250041381,0.0,0.0,

However, I was very disappointed that she has a very small role and is in only 2 scenes. This forced me to sit through a very unoriginal and unfunny gross out/romantic comedy. Jerry O'Connell has never impressed me in any of his work and he should stay away from films. Ryan Reynolds could be very funny, but hes stuck being cast as a moron who thinks he can get away with anything because of his good looks, but he tries to hard. Bridget Wilson is wasted in her role, and should get a new agent. There are a couple of funny scenes but for the most part I was bored and uninterested. Skip it, unless you're a die hard Alyssa Milano or Ryan Reynolds fan.",0.45454545454545453,143,0.0,0.0,0.0856784536778277,0.0,0.0,0.25571788786892163,0.08257077599612204,0.0777710864290307,0.0,0.08743553151253121,0.12421335986257741,0.0,0.0,0.2155105347129709,0.0,0.10232157203171585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555989914431569,0.0,0.13944430692787688,0.09342663146551503,0.2284734065278313,0.09357211850181,0.0,0.0,0.19803101088329614,0.0,0.3056351758816272,0.12301861218337162,0.0,0.19793931208377907,0.0,0.0,0.18794563348884716,0.0,0.11524592678780064,0.056046144798840423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23010251506584606,0.0,0.12130112557846143,0.07460069131097138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2233524476363137,0.0,0.08234499826766051,0.22769594084478326,0.10250011534520505,0.0,0.09994278446655269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098923654200185,0.0,0.13079198779720028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883263154270367,0.048506697872467926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09809858594515646,0.0,0.1623805494672013,0.0,0.1116218050230225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40833859157223595,0.1494635648041507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09769619635031757,0.0,0.07342301634559133,0.0,0.0805617227546272,

In fact it's my favorite in the series now.

697792,B0000640VJ,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,11,14,1008547200,A world uniquely Andersonian,"Wes Anderson's follow up to his cult classic ""Rushmore"" (a sort of 90s equivalent to ""Heathers"" in terms of its intelligent and brutally hilarious examination of young people) cements a filmmaking style that can now rightly be coined ""Andersonian."" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" once again displays Anderson's remarkable ability to create completely self-enclosed, whimsical, fairy-tale environments and then populate them with extraordinary, but always real, characters who must overcome real human dilemmas. In this case, the central dilemma is whether or not three precocious, brilliant children (similar to J.D. Salinger's Glass family) who grew up to become troubled, lonely adults can find it within themselves to forgive their selfish, but genuinely regretful father, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) -- the rejected patriarch of the Tenenbaum family.Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have lovingly drawn the characters of Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Richie (Luke Wilson) and have infused each of them with a poignancy that stays with you long after you leave the theater. You get a strong sense that inside each of their cold, brittle hearts is a tenderness that longs for the love and acceptance of their father, to whom they feel they were never quite good enough.In one particularly revealing scene, Royal confronts the older Margot (played beautifully by Paltrow in a role that harkens back to her small, dark, but always unforgettable early performances in films like ""Hard 8"" and ""Se7en"") on a staircase. He says to her, ""You were a genius once,"" to which she replies glumly, ""No, I wasn't."" He says, ""Well, that's what people said, anyway,"" as if he had needed confirmation from others as to the brilliance of his own children. This is a small example of the type of honesty that Anderson and Wilson bring to their treatment of each of their characters. There are simply no easy solutions to the problems that the central characters in this film deal with, and Anderson and Wilson do them (and us) the justice of allowing them to grow only as quickly as each of them are able. Even something as simple as Margot attempting, but failing, to quit smoking in the film exemplifies this treatment.Some reviewers have criticized Anderson by saying that he spent more time fabricating his unique, filmic world than in developing his characters. While it is true that ""Rushmore"" presented us with a much more fully realized character (Max Fischer), it is unfair to compare that film to ""Tenenbaums,"" since the latter is clearly meant to be an exploration of an entire family (thus the tagline, ""Family isn't a word, it's a sentence""), and ensemble pieces are rarely, if ever, as tight as singe-character pieces. No, the gift that ""Tenenbaums"" presents us with is, by the end, making us want to be a part of this grand family, as troubled and unpredictable and loopy though it may be. Not only this, but the film made me want to get on better terms with my own family, and for that, I feel like I owe a debt of thanks to Mr. Anderson and Mr. Wilson.",0.7857142857142857,513,0.0,0.0427339660588362,0.0,0.0,0.062450180728972945,0.27500282245123536,0.08324797631541382,0.23522676696312075,0.0,0.11753683985922038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071001899126424,0.09707594275834493,0.06877383838120679,0.04028951598050875,0.0,0.0,0.038066764560026126,0.1284581721914614,0.0,0.046862650941605064,0.031397621856895895,0.0767824067933514,0.0314465152706797,0.0,0.03841747206462344,0.0,0.08258108597634567,0.13695192370695414,0.08268502901379517,0.0,0.13304180133508445,0.0,0.06420631105992987,0.16843294286642385,0.0,0.13555629594847068,0.09417634101366258,0.043402378921148815,0.0,0.06300206731316414,0.039117560738998705,0.0,0.03866494832913271,0.06812246801822724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0383999543786922,0.03342149744700635,0.11564858317608884,0.05430205589257721,0.3377763932790968,0.05182562803652659,0.02767344896052546,0.07652112611630947,0.03444692173328396,0.0,0.0,0.08727681573506535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043954890702486905,0.0,0.0,0.03472002141380499,0.0,0.038452570500190554,0.30072102284965146,0.3097286473384565,0.19554184935479382,0.20596709202088112,0.04226478762819235,0.0329677122881083,0.06509620742972466,0.10914153724932353,0.035179807910349775,0.39388043094651987,0.0,0.0,0.07099869654590985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03580035383173413,0.07973471505268911,0.03392200275573736,0.0,0.03867832488791069,0.06566496472681992,0.0,0.17272544740775944,0.0,0.10829659455820247,
643130,B00005JOUX,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,1,2,1161648000,NIGHT OF THE CREEPS... taken to an all new level,"I've been waiting for a handful of movies from the 80s to come out on DVD and one of those was a little gem with no stars called NIGHT OF THE CREEPS. I absolutely loved it when I was in high school. Aliens crash land in 1950s America and spread like a virus through the community in the form of large wormlike leachs that dives into people's mouths and turns them into zombies. It was just a well done movie that was never, throughout the entire movie, uninteresting.So, when I saw that SLITHER was coming out, I was disappointed and excited in the same breath. No, it wasn't NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, but it looked similar. A remake? Something similar?  More something similar than remake, SLITHER was not a disappointment.Although the theme was the same, the comedy was prominent and the wormlike leaches were again on the loose, I wouldn't call SLITHER a remake. It was a whole other direction, and a pleasant one... if you like blood, guts, more guts, shocks and more shocks and some tongue and cheek comedy mixed in... SLITHER is the movie for you.NATHAN FILLION plays Bill Pardy, a small town sheriff who unknowningly finds himself in the biggest mess this side of hell. As the virus like worms destroy everything and everyone they come in contact with... feeding, growing and craving more and more, the town becomes more and more void of life and the blood splattering insanity boils over.SLITHER is a horror movie lovers dream, and is in the same note, a great comedy. I wouldn't recommend this to the queasy, but if your not, go along for the SLITHER ride.",0.5,278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38564244411732285,0.0,0.039094947042479955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970648461518771,0.0,0.07222369587947602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0596847102470725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514642481615799,0.04696487315802983,0.0,0.0,0.048571978311253386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09604043480166728,0.25194366100112464,0.1206951124653998,0.08689990608673197,0.14086990187833606,0.0,0.0495358363516365,0.1413586726508658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35664391382714133,0.0,0.15000485193407995,0.06157793568765758,0.0,0.0,0.11532552931399728,0.08122555201278761,0.19648582651866248,0.07752128674471971,0.08278843704787409,0.0,0.0,0.059013197124767554,0.10048098966865787,0.06527476188031467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046372631048001094,0.051934551259183837,0.0,0.057517735081104956,0.10380495664332234,0.48767912899358073,0.0,0.061617522470826226,0.0,0.0,0.04868577529438513,0.05441833011588506,0.0,0.05611145165296461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375671115005624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05355052316966171,0.05963398750085169,0.0,0.1047847513999336,0.0,0.049111151688137636,0.0,0.07381840906515955,0.0,0.08099555835875333,

779943,B0000DZ3IE,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,0,0,1346544000,Pretty bad and felt different than the Vacation series of movies,"This is a made for TV spin off with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) from the National Lampoon's Vacation series of movies. There is no Chevy Chase, but instead his character daughter Audrey is here. This movie doesn't feel very Christmas at all. They should have called it Tropical Vacation since the bulk of it is Eddie stuck on an island with his wife, his kid, Audrey from the Vacation series, Uncle Nick (played by Ed Asner) and their Hawaiian guide. The movie throws a lot of jokes at you per minute and nothing is all that funny but it does have its laughable moments. Its still pretty bad and doesn't feel like one of the Vacation movies simply because the family is put into a lot of peril that the original movies strayed away from. There's just not enough gags that appeal to vacations. The acting isn't that good and some of the delivery is stuff. Eddie's family barely feels like they did from the Vacation series. Mainly because in the series they have a lot of kids... while in this series they have one. Sure its explained, but I think it would have been a lot more hilarious to have 6 terrible kids. Everything about this movie felt low budget and that's just sad. I really only watched it because I never knew it existed until now. Take a pass on this movie.",0.0,234,0.05763118674161437,0.0,0.09778136990525482,0.0,0.05301907440681668,0.14592026531620444,0.0,0.0,0.10513628784647626,0.0,0.21263956047050522,0.0677756264310123,0.0,0.12297674857956513,0.054943813582151786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039785543423110255,0.21324810657024137,0.0,0.0533950458912846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28043939606690726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694251261212748,0.0,0.0,0.07149826170359662,0.06850333684210186,0.2301696890965147,0.19188962619281377,0.22108701021443006,0.1124608946969309,0.1069752322785586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05783474376654184,0.0,0.17027753137784618,0.2096999945210956,0.0,0.0,0.06545570420968976,0.04610146373004768,0.22304026209123168,0.08799804250282423,0.09397703144520414,0.06496505265311082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06343078285459466,0.0,0.38982901241742457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05895334095937272,0.0,0.0,0.19638977822060602,0.3044730781395638,0.06640459796638193,0.0,0.0,0.11195596684733466,0.2210620129537553,0.15443198660516788,0.0,0.06369473617888667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058252549438004626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08379473266224177,0.06263403775638408,0.04597092544699689,

However, even with those similarities, I found myself laughing with the audience and feel it was actually a really good movie. He's believable as a 30 something son living at home still... having a nude scene with Bradshaw may have been a bit much for me though.

536888,B00003CXT9,A16688KNH19Z1D,0,1,994464000,Stupid Fun,"It still puzzles me why people were calling &quot;The Mummy&quot; a surprise hit. Why? They advertised the film right, they made it fun, they got actors that didn't have huge price tags attached to their names, and made really cool special effects. That signals to me a &quot;hit.&quot; What really surprises me is that &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; turned out to be the giant hit that it was. Sure, it made a ton of money opening weekend due to the success of the previous film, but movies make money on good word-of-mouth and repeat viewers. When I saw this movie for the first time, I figured it would have neither of these factors going for it. Why, you ask? Because, compared to the first film, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; is just dumb fun.I loved the character development and the story line from the first film (which can be compared to &quot;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&quot;). However, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; can be compared to &quot;Temple Of Doom,&quot; in that neither spend an appropriate time on story development and focus mainly on action, as well as new characters that just show up with little explanation. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie, but it's just surprising that so many others did as well.Here's my main point about &quot;The Mummy Returns:&quot; things happen and you just have to go with the flow, rather than ask questions every five minutes. How do Rick and Evelyn have a kid? Well, it's ten years or so after their first bout with the Mummy, they're married, live in a luxurious mansion they bought with the sack of valuables they carried off at the end of the first movie, and the bad guys are now after the famous O'Connell family of explorers. Why is the Mummy coming back? Just another one of your average bad guys wanting to rule the world schemes. How can there be so many Magi warriors? They apparently live all over the desert in tribes, plus it's also a movie about mummies coming back from the dead, so nothing is to be taken too seriously. And that is the most important thing, not to take anything too seriously with &quot;The Mummy Returns.&quot;Some personal highlights in my viewing experience were: pop-culture references to both &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; within the movie, the Pigmy Mummies, the complete cheese-factor of the CG Rock/Scorpion King, and the zany fun that I had watching &quot;The Mummy Returns.&quot; This was definitely a worthy follow-up, not the one I expected, not serious at all, but worthy to add to your adventure films collection.",0.0,431,0.03724594619676258,0.04689462717268997,0.031597125171700415,0.021677773962092417,0.01713261260445744,0.09430550815050644,0.015225526562864862,0.043021482890157565,0.03397379736438433,0.08061278288366662,0.022904154493342602,0.0,0.0,0.03973877357049004,0.0,0.05660234365471437,0.022106090367002396,0.022808144946134968,0.0,0.0,0.07048255343196957,0.10592715054455408,0.025712644377598952,0.03445455469920718,0.021064522393256253,0.017254104234890048,0.0,0.021078935511243437,0.0,0.06041422620817628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04527984438100585,0.0,0.04620797452104686,0.0,0.05312654199992158,0.09301097761015263,0.0,0.09085168703668828,0.0,0.0,0.04655588298584679,0.08485888410402224,0.0,0.022367156991318693,0.06877946788441357,0.022587523512260482,0.0,0.036675478708728476,0.0,0.044691756358753186,0.11325812436896618,0.042653603132997105,0.030367789167978956,0.0,0.018900370137715873,0.0,0.018428814569135716,0.023943563587571406,0.8423299677230683,0.040994115495366315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024598283104688704,0.06804014343287251,0.019050214733012525,0.0398173617828134,0.021098193354617937,0.11423069997490275,0.3130514432116786,0.042916035967858826,0.0,0.0,0.018088756077060588,0.12500967389143583,0.02994194179937922,0.03860498166005308,0.1440764623814288,0.045893045105989384,0.0,0.038955633086844674,0.0,0.027560131882652373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0589289176885005,0.04374892012092309,0.01861235708840018,0.01921815021518143,0.02122206048913757,0.0,0.0,0.06769368897223178,0.020239597102342518,0.02971013981528618,
368461,6303305520,A2N5QMIZROR30U,4,6,998784000,"Incomprehensible, but Beautiful","&quot;Akira&quot; is the best example of why anime can often times be so frustrating to watch. Many praise &quot;Akira&quot; as the greatest film of its kind, a landmark in animation. True, from a visual standpoint, &quot;Akira&quot; is dazzling, especially in this new DVD version where the colors are more vibrant than ever before. But can anyone make sense of the damn thing? I've seen it a few times and still couldn't tell you what happens in the last 30 minutes. And to be quite honest, I don't think I care. The characters are never devloped all that well, and their faces are drawn in such a manner that it is easy to confuse them. The new voice dubbing doesn't help either; everyone in Kaneda's gang sounds exactly the same. Then there's the seemingly requisite misogyny found in many anime releases, but not the best -- &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; still stands taller than all other films in the genre. Is &quot;Akira&quot; a masterpiece? No. But I suspect that it will always be seen as one because of its cult film status. But it just doesn't work for me; I'm more interested in the fates of the characters in &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; on PSX than I am in these street thugs.",0.6666666666666666,208,0.0,0.0,0.06376206438278872,0.0,0.0,0.057091718151590934,0.0921739873188917,0.057877386987559,0.0,0.09760452745696749,0.04621990657383777,0.0,0.0903637981697084,0.10692222684292557,0.0,0.07614790397790284,0.0,0.046026162146230835,0.044179559425629254,0.0,0.07111585445465919,0.0,0.02594367806164539,0.034764136342675646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23311581594835112,0.0,0.08576623279558014,0.08341929014051665,0.09611213392455704,0.03666720365627835,0.0,0.0,0.09394839537490081,0.04281067978724193,0.07542669240935133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04268288356036544,0.030062214318988874,0.1038870665181422,0.0286912366694247,0.03064065033716839,0.0,0.0,0.04368249487142181,0.0,0.0,0.8498984850940519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03432574943611179,0.0,0.0,0.12772659117506144,0.07683805838570643,0.23464203530575192,0.04330164585491354,0.045610257373971876,0.04679650090371434,0.036502574943846657,0.0,0.02014065109176079,0.0,0.06230186598456508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044136657069143735,0.0,0.0,0.03963893785952741,0.0,0.03755918630372537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04012488439578082,0.0,0.0,0.029977091862468084,

I am definitely not a 'jump-up-and-down-and-say-yeah' aerobics person but this is a great exception.  Ellen Barrett cues very well and she's enthusiastic (using the word 'beautiful!' quite liberally) but she's not annoying.  The setting is gorgeous and the music doesn't dominate over Barret's cues.  Also, the girl with dark hair is so consistently high-energy that it's motivating- I don't think I've ever seen anyone smile so much.This is a great workout though it is brief (why I didn't give it full 5 stars).  This is good because you feel like you zip through it quickly, but I think I'd get more out of it if it was longer (there's an obviously relationship here).  But who knows- I break a sweat doing it so maybe if it was longer it would be overwhelming.  In summary, this is great and highly recommended- I love it.",1.0,166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043069063838645,0.07147016077251624,0.23604210232934217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06725662554836073,0.09554664205573948,0.0,0.0,0.27628949551323495,0.0,0.07870717472187423,0.0,0.09514613000699096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787245919811473,0.07197697351380673,0.29729694046321015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14695987491144102,0.09638026155836658,0.0,0.3545950718137981,0.5173376784870911,0.0,0.0,0.07210175899112699,0.08953499645351258,0.0,0.0,0.07796172380369934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08789248905501304,0.07649745022075191,0.0,0.12429032613255919,0.042951451418330046,0.0,0.0,0.08757344049589544,0.0,0.0,0.07687737827915064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20121402811490519,0.0,0.2128764641331155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052947016448483694,0.1865601294439708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754587951557369,0.0,0.2081756242366871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125337985484996,0.07852492938292151,0.11496945048838877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194234233432572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514927148913968,0.0,0.05647800421135277,0.08443121269776603,0.12393839271308747,

It's about a 30 year old woman who hates her life, her job, and her husband; she has a fling with a 22 year old she works with who hates his life even more than she does.This movie is mainly a drama, but it also has some funny parts. The characters are pretty believable, and one can relate to them, especially Justine (Aniston's character). I also like this movie because it is so different than what we are use to seeing Jennifer Aniston do.

1228207,B001PPLIEG,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1,1,1243900800,Missing so much of what made `Casino Royale' so unexpectedly brilliant...,"I may be extra harsh on this film because `Casino Royale' was such a blessed cinematic experience for me.  I was not in the least a huge fan of James Bond, but 2006 totally changed my opinion when it unleashed the brilliance that was `Casino Royale' (ranks in my top ten of the year and garners a Lead Actor and an Adapted Screenplay nomination from me at my personal awards, The Ellington's).  Because that film was so cleverly crafted, I expected a lot from `Quantum of Solace'.I wanted it to be bigger, bolder...better.Instead of building off the intensity provided by deep character development and genuine attachment to plot points, `Quantum of Solace' goes in a different direction and just merely offers the audience a briskly paced thrill ride with hard bodies and `Bourne' style action sequences.  I'm not saying that a good action flick is a bad thing, but when you have such a wonderful starting point it is disappointing to see them somewhat throw away all that they worked to achieve by reverting backwards and delivering something that just doesn't stack up.The films plot seems a little underdeveloped (the film is also about an hour shorter than `Casino Royale', which may be part of the problem) and so it becomes almost forgettable.  This is sad, because the film doesn't provide us with the character development needed to make the films plot unnecessary.  Daniel Craig does a fine job presenting us with a sour Bond, one that doesn't really need to develop because we saw him grow to this point so lavishly in `Casino Royale', but Craig is not the only actor here and Bond is not the only character.  The sad thing is that Bond is the only interesting one.  Vesper was such an exciting Bond Girl, and so when I see someone as beautifully dense as Olga Kurylenko's, Camille take her place I'm left a little brokenhearted.  There is no denying that Olga is a ravishingly beautiful actress, but Camille is such an underdeveloped beauty that she practically becomes nothing but eye candy.  I'm glad they gave her a character arc, but it really isn't much of an original one (very `been-there-done-that').  She has a coldness that I liked, but she could have done so much more had they really tried to flesh her out.Dench is perfect, as usual (love the inspired casting of this role), Jeffrey Wright is good, Gemma Arterton is gorgeous and Mathieu Amalric is sorely miscast.I know that this sounds rather harsh, and the film itself it not bad (I own it and will watch it again), but I just want to express my disappointment.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I don't think so.  When you come out of the gate with a blistering and inspired take on a film franchise you have an obligation to back it up.  Look at what Nolan did with his sequel to `Batman Begins', or even what Raimi did with his sequel to `Spider Man'.  They took what they did in their first film and flipped it on its head, delivering to us an even better film the second go around.  They built on their original film.  Maybe the change in directors had a hand in this films fate, but there is no way that one can say that Marc Forster does any justice to Martin Campbell's `Casino Royale'.So, if I were to grade this film separated from `Casino Royale', grading it as if I never saw Campbell's film, then I'd give it a B.  It is entertaining, action packed and exciting, and the brisk running time makes it so that you never get bored and never have time to really notice that the film is lacking in any real emotional connection.  It is also no where near the campy stupidity of some in this franchise and so the plot never makes one want to throw a shoe at the screen.  But, sadly (well, sadly for this film) I have seen `Casino Royale' and so I cannot grade this film separated from its predecessor.  Having said that, I give the film a C+.  It should have been much better.Thankfully it's not `that' bad.",1.0,697,0.02461771349440713,0.0,0.02088412442563887,0.05731171126931344,0.15853323870220437,0.23685870885521113,0.0,0.07582681413968168,0.0673649587594169,0.0639372365260876,0.12110803364641183,0.057902016172707065,0.0,0.1926125527738142,0.046939552611324174,0.02494088478501942,0.0,0.03015009336353844,0.0,0.055219764455637026,0.34939090369248404,0.028005026153546067,0.03398955199727634,0.09109097153087614,0.027845198209451257,0.045616410700188334,0.0,0.055728501828526976,0.024135031001919563,0.11979237449807026,0.0,0.08995736593826274,0.032196139466281457,0.0482477104200209,0.0,0.04656893505756162,0.1374352533180354,0.0,0.266866366362419,0.2322412274301745,0.06295962287682529,0.07205812273273819,0.0,0.028372026294491846,0.0,0.056087491650554384,0.024704664827578618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835546359300493,0.12120331463081258,0.08388009325748946,0.11815609116648126,0.1361054065222606,0.07517841366396633,0.10035797308605446,0.08325133371972743,0.024984404720478283,0.0,0.04872211055752129,0.0,0.0,0.10838026612509921,0.0535725315839437,0.0,0.09564164722105284,0.0,0.2248557129278156,0.025182484334093737,0.0,0.027889707862958475,0.30200319029534156,0.3192347258819222,0.05673072028784977,0.029877649016036487,0.03065471474356766,0.07173459558087412,0.14164313474381934,0.13193420491801058,0.051031936358573934,0.23126644213943068,0.030333014761841404,0.0,0.05149546258049125,0.024883134522511733,0.09107936565378273,0.028912346138295998,0.030601101678018026,0.02977440516159858,0.025966051079801364,0.057831710089309034,0.07381104056328033,0.10161791318507306,0.0280534478637021,0.0,0.026284377282867772,0.10738116830396487,0.0,0.07854768473193639,

I had paid no attention to the books or the movies. I planned to see the American version, and literally stumbled into the Netflix offering because of a blueray disc player connected to the internet. I watched the 'dragon tattoo'segment first, not knowing it was part 1 and 2 of 6 parts. I watched it on Netflix, which loaded quickly and played flawlessly. The only problem I notice is that the dark scenes are somewhat posterized, meaning I could see levels of dark colors. The story is a bit hard to follow, because of the subtitles and the Swedish names. Still, this is one of the most engrossing, disturbing, and eventually satisfying 9 hour stories I will ever experience. I am curious as to if the storyline caused any backlash in Sweden, because the story shows massive governmental and institutional corruption, low-level murders for hire, incompetent police work, etc. My only disbelief with the storyline as presented in the Swedish films is: Why are the 4 reporters-writer-journalists and their little office NEVER attacked or bombed by any of the bad guys???

All the actors were bad even Emma none of them made you feel for them or care about them in anyway. A story like this is to make you care about them and find what they are doing as a cause only to be shocked at the bitter truth in the end. They also failed to glamorize their crimes, i mean that is the movie so make the crimes sexy and exciting. Even their after parties bore me to death. I think Sofia just couldn't connect with this story at all and it showed in the final product. The other Emma film during this time Perks of being a Wallflower was much better and showed her talents!",0.0,141,0.17421471031877436,0.10967279291601433,0.14779283575221158,0.2027918469951536,0.0,0.22055295222078877,0.07121609115761603,0.06707642884229167,0.158909515548283,0.07541187190615085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19538969918338142,0.08241902060837841,0.0,0.060134341440927386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10610176050356927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16210037032770833,0.0,0.09939793260571288,0.04833898324044603,0.0,0.08499019063956197,0.08084450519060504,0.0,0.0,0.09923003320990727,0.0,0.0,0.1286840184976057,0.0,0.09854995061212908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631911580854842,0.0,0.0,0.09819221561017424,0.08840485595573319,0.10125079625749263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07956297992528955,0.0,0.27936342838513867,0.0,0.059367141745089134,0.3765268811137938,0.20073606761587637,0.4228764762834174,0.0,0.0,0.16706342835646776,0.1400508578679592,0.09028574091309204,0.19254436078136297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19336522021425395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10231590580840573,0.08705769968563898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633262817510682,0.0,0.13896662402149576,

Because, I gotta tell ya, it wasn't scary.  Yeah the idea of seeing one of your freinds being helplessly dragged around the ceiling while cuts start forming on her is unnerving, but really I was just waiting for people to die.  This movie didn't suck me in one bit, didn't make me believe anything other than Freddy could very well be the most evil man in the slasher genre.  He specifically targeted kids when he was alive, and that creeped me out more than thinking of him as a dream haunter.  I don't know.  Talks of a prequel are coming to fruition, and I think THAT would be a truly terrifying film.  Skip this and go for what I consider to be the scariest film of all time, &quot;Halloween.&quot;  It's way better than this one.",0.4444444444444444,166,0.0,0.0,0.06592892571685534,0.0,0.0,0.1967729914591606,0.19061277334094354,0.05984426609026894,0.0,0.20184295168699604,0.09558124620472865,0.0,0.0,0.05527791186847774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518058910244072,0.0,0.0,0.14706524736979854,0.0,0.10730134541942007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15678931277111655,0.09466189685128522,0.10163973571408419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14462275142927966,0.0,0.04434043694890655,0.08625417379854267,0.0,0.07582657084584978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26559323211088065,0.15597991843772635,0.09334030382603527,0.11480934178297109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062167670194059624,0.34373605724173006,0.05933253351859203,0.1900915705490175,0.0,0.0,0.09033396228250931,0.07690522097665031,0.19983760124805633,0.292927017723507,0.08553619927875064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3521791846258906,0.10593238456284061,0.223953235161956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07452534692942266,0.16660081539972538,0.08055115629461652,0.17178427891372153,0.0,0.0,0.08128280740983121,0.0785533687743775,0.11501108900030614,0.0,0.09660437365078907,0.0,0.08197201941100417,0.0,0.07767116161540875,0.0801991947727489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844617911691876,0.0,

It's deserved status as a classic is not disputed with this reviewer.The fun begins when Algernon Moncrieff (Michael Denison) discovers that his best friend Jack Worthing (Michael Redgrave) sometimes invents a fake brother named Earnest to get out of sticky situations.  Algie also learns of the beautiful young Cecily Cardew (Dorothy Tutin), who is Jack's young ward at his country estate.When the formidable Lady Bracknell (Dame Edith Evans) calls with her daughter Gwendolen (Joan Greenwood), the history of Jack (or Earnest's) parentage is discussed when it is discovered that Gwendolen has decided to marry Jack based on the desirability of his name (which she thinks is Earnest)!.Getting confused?  This is only the first half-hour!Algie, wishing to see for himself the beauty that is Cecily, high-tails it down to Jack's estate, and disguises himself as Earnest.  Of course, Cecily too is enamored with the name of Earnest and is soon engaged to him.  When Jack returns home in funeral garb with the story of Earnest's death in Paris, the story is quickly blown with the appearance of Algie as the wayward 'brother'!Also staying at the estate is the nervous Miss Prism (Margaret Rutherford) who is Cecily's tutor.  Prism's shameless flirtation with the stuffy Canon Chasuble (Miles Malleson) is the prime focus of her life.It is not until Lady Bracknell makes her way to the estate that the true story of Jack (or Earnest's) parentage is uncovered, with the 'help' of Miss Prism...Oscar Wilde's classic witty repartee is given top-shelf treatment in Anthony Asquith's classic film version in glowing Technicolor.  Truly a delightful good time.The DVD includes the trailer, stills gallery and bio's for the cast.",0.9090909090909091,289,0.0,0.0,0.03999408146181812,0.10975462521220841,0.0,0.07162035447416369,0.0,0.1089089391498322,0.08600471162961605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05667973802576786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055422324095667,0.0,0.044606668617432316,0.05363094350990514,0.06509159224127672,0.0,0.053324865472553704,0.043678787014392005,0.0,0.0,0.04621972060218409,0.0,0.0,0.17227259080148882,0.06165712281381062,0.13859495530362634,0.0,0.0,0.1169755468029442,0.0,0.4572656914668133,0.10464773741759291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05662248662933872,0.0,0.05718034475991935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07542482571946434,0.364907565520315,0.035992550357482264,0.0384380486262481,0.05314340779838446,0.09569262252039797,0.0,0.046652567733147986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05129696004046203,0.0,0.061052752354563436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15119655368167378,0.0,0.12852229492851414,0.543421803605399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05053204272823809,0.09772856061772328,0.15631274975360154,0.058089151292274266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05860255035779853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19460308773655696,0.05372367336446029,0.09120775335270837,0.0,0.239913324714978,0.0,0.0,
329323,6302719666,A2X9QA4JU5Q4VY,11,12,970790400,Night and Day,"Twenty years ago, a meteorite fell to Earth, and decimated a provincial  Russian town. Villagers travelled through this curious area, now known  as The Zone, and disappeared. Stories purport that there is an inner  chamber within the Zone, The Room, that grants one's deepest wish.  Fearing the consequences from such an inscrutible resource, the army  immediately secured the area with barbed wire and armed patrol. But  the desperate and the suffering continue to make the treacherous  journey, led by a disciplined, experienced stalker who can stealthily  navigate through the constantly changing traps and pitfalls of the Zone. A  successful Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), perhaps searching for inspiration  or adventure, and a Scientist (Nikolai Grinko) searching for Truth, enlist  the Stalker (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky) to guide them through The Zone.  The Stalker has been trained by a renowned stalker named Porcupine,  who, after an excursion with his brother into The Zone, returned alone  and infinitely wealthy, only to commit suicide a week later. Soon, it is  evident that reaching The Zone is not their greatest impediment, but the  uncertainty over their deepest wish. As the men approach the threshold  to The Room, their fear and trepidation for the materialization of their  answered prayers leads to profound revelation and self-discovery.&quot;Stalker&quot; is a visually serene, highly metaphoric, and deeply haunting  treatise on the essence of the soul. Episodically, Andrei Tarkovsky uses  chromatic shifts to delineate between the outside world and The Zone.  Thematically, as in &quot;Solaris&quot;, the transition serves as an oneiric device to  separate physical reality from the subconscious. The created barriers  and imposed laws of the outside world parallel the Stalker's incoherent  tracking methods for reaching The Room. Note that despite the  Stalker's warning not to use the same path twice, the Scientist returns to  retrieve his knapsack unharmed, casting doubt on the Stalker's  navigational rules. Symbolically, it is as if the subconscious is in denial of  its sincerest wish, creating its own boundaries and impediments to  prevent its realization. After a circuitous route, the men arrive at the  antechamber to The Room, hesitant to proceed, unable to define their  innermost wish: their spiritual longing. The floor is strewn with coins,  hypodermic needles, weapons, and religious icons: a reflection of the  mind's search for escape from its misery. In the end, The Zone's real or  imagined powers proves to be inconsequential to the weary, ambivalent  seekers. It was all in the journey...",0.9166666666666666,399,0.0,0.08566021134199084,0.028858491720597883,0.0,0.12518135274933648,0.24116881494319753,0.0,0.13097553454065727,0.03102916941429431,0.029450316315564395,0.0,0.040005623895694516,0.0,0.04839263326811852,0.06486289119880248,0.03446428025439475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11742019738400215,0.09440477348374364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033350720295948544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06667055430797089,0.0,0.0321753787567417,0.08440593521688836,0.0404351663513539,0.13586126014721328,0.056632927050619515,0.1740000891100079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054424220509495115,0.11284543226804046,0.051942221375241744,0.027735706571871667,0.03834663874999059,0.06904883557242383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564407602216414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09273771139481388,0.7352181738648561,0.235178117362761,0.0412860922099128,0.0,0.03304188052863134,0.0,0.018231179256985298,0.0,0.3007745166090638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025171398772267085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581269274795874,0.0,0.07419172796738642,0.0,0.0,
394705,6303995705,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,3,4,1104883200,ACCIDENTS OF TRUTH AND ERROR,"The ambitious SHORT CUTS (Criterion) is the clever collaboration of two great American artists, writer Raymond Carver and director Robert Altman.  This saturnine look at L.A. life in the 90s follows eight interweaving stories centered around the idea of life's randomness.  All have equal weight, but for me the most memorable is the one about a group of friends who decide to keep fishing after finding a body floating in the river.Not exactly a dark comedy, but more a set of parables about the price paid for disconnecting from a moral imperative; i.e., choosing (knowingly or not) to sidestep authentic moral action.A large, talented and brave cast work wonders with bold scenes that surprise with moments of accidental truth.  There's a treasure trove of archival extras as well as a paperback of Carver's memorable stories.  As time passes, this sometimes subtle and sometimes jolting film just grows and grows in my admiration.

Women know the trials and difficulties that it takes to be the creation vessel for humankind. Men only want to avoid it and minimize it. They can not identify with what is really the pinnacle event. Sad that the culture has made it that way for most men. It is something women do, so it is not that important? or they can not identify with it. Now if the baby came out with the sound of an engine roar, maybe that would get their attention. lolA good validation for the trials and life that women went through on the East side of London.

Wow!First of all, any movie that has narrative voice over always makes me smile. I don't know exactly why, they just do. I think because it gives far mor insight as to what's happening.These three women living on the outskirts of a dying town smacked of ""The last picture show"". Life has dealt each a pretty hard hand and it's hard to tell if Mom Nora, older sister Trudi, or young Shady Lynne has it the worst. Nora's found love where she could and it's burnt her every time and that's been passed right on down to her two daughters.They've no faith that it will ever change, yet they continue to try to find love anyway.

It was the last time I would see him in concert sadly. He played solo. It was amazing. I went out and bought this the very next week. Denver is in top form both musicially and vocally, as is his band. There are also some interesting monologues peppered throughout the concert where Denver shares his concerns about the environment and wildlife preservation.

630129,B00005JNEI,AUH36NUNBVII8,17,28,1135123200,ANTI-AMERICAN?  I THINK NOT,"Many people view certain elements of their country, such as culture and people, as an entirely separate entity from the government and power structures that rule it (in this context, phrases like ""love it or leave it"" have little relevancy). It is this sentiment that led Thomas Paine to say, ""It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government."" Noam Chomsky, a critic of American foreign policy, writes:The concept ""anti-American"" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as ""anti-Soviet."" That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture.In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as ""anti-Italian."" It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.It's pretty obvious that the critics of this movie who call Moore Anti-American can't see beyond their Republican noses. Yes, you can be a critic of the American government and a patriot at the same time. Wow! What a concept! If any Repulicans and their chicken hawk friends knew history, they'd know that Jefferson advocated a revolution every 20 years just to keep the government from getting out of control. Moore is a true patriot in the old sense of the word.The ""new"" patriots like Hannity and Limbaugh are totalitarians wrapped in the stars and stripes, depending on followers too dumb to see what they're really up to. Most Americans can't even recall when we were Saddam's best friends - that's when he was gassing the Kurds. Why didn't we get rid of him then?The fact that the US Government encourages trade with China, a Communist country, is and always will be a slap in the face to the veterans of the Vietnam war, who were told they were over there fighting for FREEDOM from Communism. We also do trade with Vietnam, as if they are no longer Communist. Does something stink here? Trouble is, we have had a government that for a long, long time, we can't trust around the corner, and an uneducated citizenry with a very short memory. No wonder the rest of the world thinks we're stupid. I do listen to right wing radio, and never heard anyone knocking trade with China - instead they knock legitimate protests against it, like the WTO protest. Whose side are the chickenhawks on anyway?Whenever rich fat-a**ed chicken hawks are telling you to send your poor or working class kid over to fight for oil for Haliburton under some false pretext, it's time for a change.I disliked Bowling for Columbine, but I have to hand it to Moore for this one.

1519628,B006TXDNEW,ALU0RYT740WDF,4,4,1383868800,Stellar Performance By Joan Crawford And A MUST For Crawford Collectors!,"Oh, this is one of those great Joan Crawford movies that you must add to your campy/classic DVD collection.  Originally meant to be a pilot for a television show in the mid 1960's, the producers opted, instead to add to the story a bit and make it a movie of the week.  And what a movie!  If you love Joan in glorious clothes, swathed in furs and dripping in diamonds, you will not regret making this purchase.***SPOILER ALERT***Della, played by Joan Crawford is a pillar of her community who is asked to sell some land in what may have been filmed in the Newport Beach highlands...she demures and asks the attorney (Paul Burke who is handsome and young enough to be Crawford's son, but this doesn't stop Crawford from desiring him in a carnal way) representing the buyers to come visit her at her stately mansion, AT 2 AM!  Turns out she has a beautiful daughter (played by the sublime Diane Baker) and neither one of them goes out in the daylight.  Diane Baker and Paul Burke's characters fall for one another, and it may even be implied that they spent time on the stately grounds of Della's estate in their private observatory, doing more than looking at the stars...as the couple enter at night but don't leave 'til the sun begins to rise.  This was extremely 'racy' for the time.  So Della and her daughter live their lives at night and Della has Paul Burke stay at the estate so he can go over the land~title documents before she decides if she will sell or keep her ocean~front land.  The drama goes on from there.***END OF SPOILERS***The fact that this DVD is available is really a miracle.  I own EVERY Joan Crawford/Bette Davis movie that has ever been made available on DVD.  This is one of those movies I had heard and read about but I doubted that it would ever see the light of day.  As I wrote, snatch it up, pronto, before they are gone.  This is a real keeper and fun to share with your friends who are into melodrama.",1.0,354,0.044743188930364726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718918711461118,0.0731611013953258,0.06890837915979117,0.24487433227652067,0.11620721210449077,0.0,0.1052380778439496,0.0,0.0954755958853835,0.08531358004765227,0.04533055924467197,0.0,0.05479840050699332,0.15779954782693528,0.0501815157262701,0.0,0.0,0.09266504058255248,0.08277983554367101,0.0,0.0,0.04280625184600181,0.050643835925023,0.13159771140456647,0.03628750794830364,0.04513422136524456,0.27249886690790603,0.058517130410810976,0.0,0.0,0.08463997519671132,0.24979133445104248,0.05318401226802014,0.2042252560522518,0.09931837585340489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05156672788153662,0.0,0.0,0.04490122472555435,0.0,0.09914891816118528,0.1085366795773303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035791844976019296,0.19789944894283165,0.10247870806978555,0.14592210609577358,0.0,0.04540965760183319,0.0,0.08855341493256719,0.0,0.0,0.049245827853389226,0.048684576304840355,0.0,0.23177415412388977,0.0590993512422219,0.08173595527372435,0.04576967127967794,0.047832205189405466,0.050690104440793526,0.1524713518448511,0.4082998165705012,0.10310922403787069,0.05430322743106735,0.0,0.04345968962074877,0.08581308116439057,0.16785514791435013,0.09275156973830123,0.2225283911599049,0.0,0.0,0.04679701898023361,0.0,0.033107715434504574,0.0,0.05561811718086355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943536622711304,0.0,0.0,0.12984426828189663,0.0955447677097651,0.03252790517472401,0.04862725797006533,0.10707149646946915,
99360,0790732181,A1X33UTXS7MPPV,0,0,1393977600,A poetic and powerful movie,"I would be neglectful if I did not give a movie 5 stars that won for best picture, best actor, best actress & screenplay.  This movie is a true experience in the human experience.I truly enjoyed the movie's simplistic approach to mental illness as it had no interest in being about insanity. It is about a free spirit in a closed system. Nurse Ratched, who is so inflexible, so unseeing, so blandly sure she is right, goes to such a radical extreme, and McMurphy is the Huck Finn who wants to break loose from her version of civilization.Jack Nicholson as McMurphy takes the patients at face value, treats their illnesses as choices that can be reversed, and tries by sheer force of will to bust them loose into a taste of freedom. I also enjoyed watching this aspect of the movie as I believe each person has free will and the freedom of choice.I would recommend this movie to anyone who not only enjoys watching a great movie but also appreciates the many facets of the human experience.",0.0,178,0.16040028855931662,0.0,0.0,0.18671139030671188,0.0,0.12183847316024711,0.0,0.24703031155395133,0.07315436251659328,0.1388641176443902,0.0,0.0,0.2892657872563396,0.057045230408224366,0.07646036852094482,0.08125297902566499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055365965949717884,0.07418955725732047,0.0,0.0,0.07672827208323774,0.09077678737614019,0.07862765032941543,0.0,0.0,0.09768838102295417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758566653928886,0.14924655976846346,0.0953299386841796,0.22879033927420447,0.08901185033392607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002468433156987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35543991082417803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910888221871918,0.1283105294787719,0.26604436458666486,0.0,0.0,0.09040602650219066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386117443462362,0.0,0.21976200945323265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10931920329150242,0.3081511455757732,0.09240931236786384,0.09733608128827666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12894547179107888,0.0,0.2215956030154442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23273998342634195,0.17125967859410546,0.0,0.17432432503606146,0.0,
990747,B000FIHN84,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,3,4,1164412800,"""Sexual tension, male female dynamics... all part of the high school experience...""","Viola (Amanda Bynes) wants to join the boys soccer team, but this wish causes her to break up with her boyfriend (Robert Hoffman). Eventually, she finds herself disguised as her brother Sebastian (James N. Kirk), and attending Illyria Prep school. When Viola is assigned a shared dorm room with campus cool guy Duke (Channing Tatum), her fa&#65533;ade slowly begins to crumple as she begins harboring a deep-rooted crush on her unsuspecting new roommate. The situation begins to take a turn for the worse, however, when Duke reveals his affection towards campus knockout Olivia (Laura Ransey), who in turn seems increasingly drawn towards the sensitive impostor known as Sebastian. The problem is, the real Sebastian has decided to cut his London trip short, and upon arriving on campus two days earlier than expected, Viola's elaborately execute ruse hits an unexpected hitch that sends the entire situation spiraling into chaos.Amongst the hype of Lindsay Lohan and Hillary Duff, there's another young actress ready to break out big time: Amanda Bynes. Fresh from doing sketch shows like ""All That"", Bynes has appeared in comedies like ""Big Fat Liar"" and, in her first leading role, ""What A Girl Wants"". Sadly, critics haven't been too appeased, despite her charms and decent comic timing. Enter ""She's The Man"", based on William Shakespeare's play ""Twelvth Night"".Directed by Andy Fickman (""Reefer Madness: The Musical""), ""She's The Man"" kicks off as a growing-up party for Amanda Bynes, where we get to see her in a bikini top and jeans. And, honestly, she looks really good. However, Fickman kind of gets lost in teen movie clich&#65533;s 101. While it's cool to hear Bynes say ""bi-atch"" and ""you suck"", it's the world she's populated in: a geeky villain (played by James Snyder), a typically sexy love interest, and a soundtrack comprised of punk rock and girly pop. Plus, it doesn't go above and beyond gender-bending clich&#65533;s. There is comic potential here, but with an overdose of subplots, and the PG-13 rating, it fails.But, as I already stated, at least Bynes is reliable to turn in a good performance. Despite the fact that she is not capable of being bought as a boy (maybe she should've watched ""Transamerica""), at least she can mug her way and deliver some funny lines to stay above Fickman's lame direction.There are a couple mixed bag performances. Julia Hagerty reprises her role from ""Just Friends"" as an over-the-top mother, Channing Tatum is surprisingly funny even for a love interest of a girl, and David Cross is sadly underused and wasted.Much like with Amy Smart, Bynes is a surprisingly talented - and underrated - comic actress (and it doesn't hurt that she did sketch comedy at a young age) whose talents deserve to be in a larger-scaled project. And she looks really good at 19 going on 20. ""She's the Man"" is not a bad piece of work, but one wonders if they hired a better director who can avoid teen movie clich&#65533;s and make something like ""Mean Girls"". Maybe Amanda should get in bed with Tina Fey.",0.75,510,0.0,0.0,0.02896096679398972,0.0,0.09421939914515577,0.3284627625375395,0.02791051190967624,0.18401687103867181,0.12455740982624591,0.029554892928752262,0.0,0.04014768188280239,0.0,0.0971289462194157,0.06509321610976308,0.06917332240990749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03828788155485996,0.0,0.03883584563889852,0.070702290410166,0.06316000010273988,0.077228409894547,0.09488753241150577,0.0,0.0,0.06693829410060341,0.0,0.0,0.41582659228212804,0.0,0.06690729814101422,0.0,0.032289631931558656,0.19058772714362565,0.04057874962242654,0.17529903867400298,0.09472337961150692,0.0,0.03330876055526768,0.1267360501412725,0.0786895629087735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0504329396977627,0.0,0.03862300676079271,0.0,0.0,0.05461747821835255,0.13212049760411035,0.10425333125644541,0.027834194690864324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03378258521236293,0.0,0.0,0.07514792634828758,0.03714573512040106,0.0,0.5305225180311397,0.0,0.0,0.0349216983066095,0.0,0.03867592851159263,0.09306701841034966,0.262339163431317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947763182484602,0.03273716467037437,0.01829591727068564,0.035384155547819776,0.2075167545042231,0.04206417350208903,0.04311899687036794,0.071411104025211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0424359418424348,0.04128952411992125,0.0,0.0,0.03411904422734092,0.07045909489541366,0.0,0.06604639035713239,0.0,0.12409196519203261,0.0,0.027231413236477996,

I've been an avid fan of Smallville ever since it came out a couple years ago.  I still remember the first time I saw the commercial for it.  It was in a movie theater, but I forget what movie I was seeing at the time.  See, it's that good! LOL  Anyway, I've tried not to miss any episodes, but I know I've missed one here or there.  I was actually able to see an episode I never saw before after I bought this 1st season.  And here I thought I never missed an episode in the 1st season.  I can't wait till I get the 2nd season which is released on May 18.  I already pre-ordered it.  One more thing, I think the guy they picked to play Lex Luthor is perfect for the part.  I love his character, but I am a guy, so I don't like him that way. LOL  Also, the actress who plays Lana is HOT, and the one who plays Chloe is pretty cute.  All in all they have an awesome storyline, and it's a good wholesome family show.  The only thing I'm sad about is he hasn't been able to learn how to fly, and he hasn't created his suit yet, but the great stories they have more than make up for it.

FOO's, always with front-line troops, lasted an average of 23 hours before being killed or wounded; George Blackburn lasted ten months from just after D-Day until VE-Day (Victory in Europe).]My father appreciated ALL of Ken Burns' work (especially the ""Baseball"" series -- Dad was a star pitcher when he was young: he left me his VHS tapes of that one).My father, who almost made it to age 90, lived long enough to author a best-selling WWII trilogy for Canada's largest publishing house. He would have been greatly impressed, I believe, with Ken Burns' latest accomplishment.""Episode One -- A NECESSARY WAR"" aired last evening (on our closest PBS station -- ""Prairie Public Television"" of North Dakota - which gets most of its funding from this Manitoba city of 700,000).  I found myself enthralled by Ken Burns' approach to ""THE WAR.""-----We're taken in quick sequence to four places:  a small town in  Connecticut - close to New York City - ""Waterbury.""  Next we visit the Midwest, (a town just to the south of us, here in Manitoba) -- Luverne, Minnesota; then, off to the heart of the South -- Mobile, Alabama; and finally, out to the west coast -- standing in for all of California - SACRAMENTO (a city of ""110 thousand that feels like a small town"").The opening thoughts --from Luverne MN - are narrated by a familiar voice (from ""Saving Private Ryan"") -- Tom Hanks:""Much of the world was already at war in the Fall of 1941 . . . ""  (and)""There was a saying (in this small town where everybody knew everyone else's business) that, ""If you don't want everyone to know about it . . . don't do it.""In our first glimpse at Mobile, we're introduced to one WWII veteran, now in his 80s, ""John Gray who (because of the color of his skin) would soon be asked to fight a war for `Freedom' - though his own country's definition of that word, didn't include HIM.""Then back to the Midwest for a few minutes: ""Sam Hynes,"" a surprisingly young-looking WWII veteran from Minnesota who was ""barely 17 in 1941,"" recalls how,""You could, all of a sudden, choose to be an adult (just) by signing your name; and suddenly (I see myself as) a fighter pilot - an ""Ace"" . . . or a submarine commander going into Tokyo Bay: It is the opportunity to be someone more exciting than the kid you are.""[To inject a personal note (since my lovely, new daughter-in-law ""Eriko"" hails from Osaka Japan), I was deeply moved by the interviews with Japanese-Americans, now in their 80s, who'd been singled out as enemy aliens, requiring internment.We see and hear ""Asako Tokuno"" -- born in America, whose parents were born in Japan, as she fights back tears, recalling what it was like (on a day's notice) to be sent off to remote internment camps.We're told how this grim process flowed from a simple, innocuous-sounding ""executive order"" from President Roosevelt's office: ""(First,) designate military areas - then exclude anyone who might pose a military threat."" On the strength of which, ""110 thousand Japanese-Americans were forced out of their homes, with only the possessions they could carry, and moved inland.""But it's the interviews with those ""old soldiers"" (Navy, Airmen and Marines too), that really hit home:  Some of these men being interviewed, were still in their teens when they volunteered for military service; they're still comparatively young-looking today.  But you hear some of their stories on this great program - and you wonder how they survived at all.""Glen Frazier"" with the infantry in the Phillipines, (the largest, eventual surrender of Americans in U.S. military history) was among those few who survived the infamous ""Bataan Death March."" A good-looking man in his old age, he quietly sums up the experience in a sentence or two.After a march in which he saw his comrades (and Filipino civilians including women) ""beheaded, buried alive"" (etc.) -- a march on which between 6,000 and 11,000 died (""no one knows for certain the correct number"") -- Mr. Frazier, says, matter-of-factly,""I marched without sleep for six days and seven nights . . . no water and no food. They say you can't do that. But I did.  (At the end of the march) my tongue wouldn't go back into my mouth.""Ken Burns' approach is so well-balanced and suddenly, inter-cut gracefully with such horrific recollections are the peaceful scenes of small-town America - back where ""war bond drives raise one billion dollars in a month.""We learn that ""The War"" cost the U.S. 304 billion dollars (""more than 3 trillion in today's terms"").  Citizens of Sacramento - ""in one bond drive alone"" raised 16 million ""to pay for 96 minutes of the war."")Statistics are parceled out in small digestible chunks throughout the show - again a remarkable ""balance"" to keep the show moving along at a pace that an entire family watching this together, would appreciate. (I watched alone but kept thinking that my ten-year-old grandson would find this as riveting as Ken Burns' ""THE CIVIL WAR.""------Ken Burns reserves the longest, single interview in Program One until the very end.  I didn't catch the name of this ""old soldier"" when it flashed on the screen (I was busy jotting down a note about him). He is an Hispanic-American who joined the Marines -- after the Navy twice turned him down (""too small"").He tells the story of the death of one of his buddies (on one of the Solomon Islands, which he described as ""hell on earth"") recounting how his ""best friend"" died on a night ""so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of you"" - so dark he didn't realize it was his own best friend who'd taken a single bullet of `friendly fire' -- then moaned and cried out in the darkness, ""all night until dawn.""Not knowing who this dying man was, but, like the rest of his buddies,  desperately in need of sleep,  he muttered under his breath, ""Just DIE -- Die, will you? -- let the rest of us get some sleep.""  He runs out of words to say - allowing the viewer imagine how he felt at the moment he saw his friend's body in the light of day.  The episode ends there, with a fade-to-black in silence.How wished I could have turned to my father to say, ""Well . . .  what do you think of it, so far?"" I believe he'd have said (once again) ""Good work, Ken Burns!"" But then, I can hear his voice adding, ""Bet you Canada (and its WWII efforts) will hardly get a mention.""  (Hope you're wrong, Dad!)",0.8130841121495327,1163,0.033538142481833545,0.06333945764627306,0.07112914251302654,0.0,0.07713537462290258,0.1188844598939908,0.05483935100251931,0.09039036809798265,0.09177520023008848,0.07258784577325414,0.020624064502633606,0.03944164166235146,0.0806435555717864,0.08349322546528855,0.0639484818063939,0.033978417521717146,0.05971634103707559,0.041075225255857516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05722931320724528,0.09261188599317537,0.13961084284059885,0.03793513257011619,0.031072944323613294,0.016043136484513828,0.0,0.0,0.0544000390215796,0.2706499886380537,0.0,0.06579400924239674,0.21362464906757975,0.12231681786653777,0.015860891990868552,0.3224620632404131,0.0398651286115628,0.028702702716925824,0.09305756697460314,0.042886777505254374,0.0654459802622224,0.04669022258214525,0.0,0.0,0.03820562553163803,0.03365660133876814,0.020140524666106857,0.0,0.0,0.018971889797133046,0.16512232284619774,0.05713736411178664,0.013414242761749084,0.3708486182137515,0.12802490519647294,0.1230511518131653,0.018903022091045843,0.05105656089036643,0.0,0.09956544621406654,0.0,0.0,0.018456592284395227,0.07298497473305257,0.022685878430067898,0.021716362843267785,0.0442990879713635,0.0612668023757822,0.051461343952714456,0.01792678786663208,0.037995770659087415,0.10285912650249349,0.4107502494800467,0.07728755883616933,0.0,0.1044067507572656,0.03257607018099176,0.0804036159384957,0.08987081931416854,0.0,0.22240074425895398,0.04132442971266683,0.02118035143804416,0.017538815714798338,0.01694987049061698,0.14889925872988458,0.0,0.0,0.1216902101222844,0.035375061173036806,0.05909062594452522,0.033519024092226575,0.051914996876362765,0.09554710795676487,0.14599101028086373,0.03580873546844072,0.10971870691592597,0.0911238081867108,0.16051511705725538,

Oh, the things they could have done with this!!!! They simply missed the opportunity to make a great film. Don't get me wrong, it was good - but not great.

1324298,B0034G4P7G,A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,3,6,1286668800,"well directed, Ironic, wordy, smart, anti-social","Social Network a movie, an unauthorized biopic about Mark Zuckerberg.  There is also an actual person, Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook. I have no way of telling how accurate this movie is. He might be a great, unfairly maligned guy. All I can do is review the character in the movie, as presented.The Zuckerberg character is played well by Jessie Eisenberg. Zuckerberg, as portrayed, is a brilliant but antisocial IT geek at Harvard. Early in the movie he is in a restaurant with a girl he hopes will be his girlfriend Erica, a Boston University student. He arrogantly informs her he will get into one of Harvard's exclusive clubs (like fraternities) and bring her and that will make her socially successful, which is what she wants(!) Then he goes on to allude she won't have to study very hard in school because she's going to BU not Harvard(!) After a bunch of the rude, arrogant, patronizing, rapid-fire speech, she dumps him and leaves, not before telling him he will think girls reject him because he is a nerd, not because he is rude, thoughtless, a-hole, (or words to that effect). Zuckerberg goes back to his room and vindictively trashes the girl publically on his Blog site. This scene shows Zuckerberg and sets the tone for the whole movie.Zuckerberg sets up a web site, FaceMash, at Harvard where guys can look at pictures of female students and rate which one is hotter than the other and make a pecking order of hotness. It soon overwhelms Harvards computers and enraged women and It administrators get the site shut down. The plot gets more elaborate. Zuckerberg has one true friend at Harvard the rich(er) student Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), a Business Major who advises Zuckerberg and recognizes the facebook idea has commercial potential and lends him money and becomes a stockholder in his corporation.This happens very early, I'm not giving away too much plot. The rest of the movie is ironic, the creator of the world's largest social network is himself brilliant but a rude nerd, patronizing, argumentative, self absorbed, vindictive, hateful, hypercompetitive and antisocial. His character is very much like Sheldon on ""Big Bang Theory"" except Zuckerberg lacks Sheldon's charm and Sheldon, for all his funny self-absorbed faults, is never that vindictive and hateful.Zuckerberg has made Facebook the rest is two hours or court cases of people who think Zuckerberg has screwed them over or ones he actually has, his only friend. It's not a pretty picture. Zuckerberg is increasingly nasty. Eduardo is the only likeable sympathetic character in the movie.The movie is interesting, very tautly directed and well acted. Insightful. Actor Jessie Eisenberg does a great job of portraying Zuckerberg, the man you love to hate. The movie is a great character study. The director makes this very, very wordy movie flow along through the court cases and flashbacks of Zuckerberg with rapid-fire speech and rapid-fire editting. I separate the high quality of acting and direction in this movie from the abrasiveness of it's characters. Someone has said to be a CEO, you have to be a sociopath. A social network creator with no friends. Ironic, don't you think?Plot is a bit like Citizen Kane, but without Kane's spectacular camera work, and Zuck is never sympathetic at all, whereas Charles Foster Kane was, initially.",0.5,553,0.030236398323689222,0.03806923360045019,0.07695199291175824,0.03519619583973396,0.055633275771510504,0.306230255877294,0.0,0.04656666746212332,0.13790027836198665,0.10470681347710192,0.11156206931129899,0.0,0.0,0.06452016980450184,0.028826458846679844,0.06126665882892946,0.035891613556282904,0.03703147461861068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04174724160580067,0.02797033627356521,0.06840103201739879,0.0,0.08678238492841266,0.0,0.177861297580156,0.07356674193740823,0.3050064887759833,0.11048900822073245,0.15817802049060395,0.20740876149160567,0.03675834689515168,0.0,0.13129132244054628,0.0359405088870746,0.3622779329235956,0.0838962880428332,0.0,0.0,0.08418737970238789,0.03484758600693512,0.0,0.0,0.030343195209807272,0.0,0.24567588795881473,0.0,0.06841662351097376,0.0,0.06868311610222869,0.12093644946931957,0.20060371341390482,0.06925270886966803,0.07395805422491625,0.06816827208316058,0.09206034669063841,0.03514581978330597,0.0,0.03887494881176184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15662754069972237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03425518443324659,0.06182193943986333,0.3920960544411439,0.0,0.03669684826048127,0.03765126950950011,0.029369039574760378,0.0,0.0810232675208953,0.0,0.13367064071484486,0.03725614553543938,0.03819040026222795,0.0316243285307571,0.183374390266311,0.02237341806421114,0.0,0.03758541993310947,0.0,0.06378495415672988,0.0,0.03021916209053239,0.0,0.06891259207744496,0.08774571302750885,0.1291338290041397,0.06594478764324385,0.0,0.07235640761776975,
365766,6303257216,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,7,7,1140739200,Nuclear nightmare,"When THE CHINA SYNDROME was released, plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film, particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power. But it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at Three Mile Island to shut those critics up.One of the most controversial and often debated issues of the decade was whether or not the convenience and efficiency of the nation's nuclear power plants were worth the obvious risks they entailed. Curiously, however, the Seventies managed to produce only one feature film dealing with the subject, ""The China Syndrome"", an excellent, thought-provoking ""doomsday"" thriller that became the first major screen success of 1979.Fonda and Douglas are the L.A. news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass; but the TV station will not air the footage, fearing a massive lawsuit. It is thus up to Fonda and Douglas to get at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident.  Fundamentally, nuclear power can NEVER be made safe because people can NEVER be perfect. That is what the film is saying; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly.",1.0,219,0.0,0.0,0.0567469906069819,0.0,0.061538776154798226,0.3048630772901358,0.05468869766817137,0.0,0.1830461552540483,0.11582149472760835,0.08226962629237378,0.0,0.0,0.09515869131694689,0.0637728040889428,0.13554029135047338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898751599627647,0.07609612563563078,0.04617873243364281,0.0,0.07566183618889934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041493703649691745,0.0,0.11449540539407513,0.1484830743755777,0.08553791998155634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034078042188829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701913183634137,0.22189789913326194,0.0,0.1090783188220898,0.15080873733964925,0.06788839939362905,0.0,0.0,0.08600308861127114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13676873920818008,0.6425440727245479,0.15415047265997348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414618646068442,0.03584957135205797,0.0,0.18482480860923323,0.0,0.08448866116213537,0.20988760207034138,0.0,0.09899347086631752,0.0,0.0831502625675754,0.0,0.0,0.15714211629551364,0.06685388288521935,0.06902983634227748,0.0,0.0,0.07142072515858598,0.04862990682075984,0.0,0.0,

16024,0767821505,A32YKRX63YZTDG,3,3,1205107200,candid,"Crumb takes a deeply personal look at 60's counterculture artist Robert Crumb. The film focuses upon three decades of Crumb's artwork to reconstruct his unhappy childhood, days with Zap Comix in the late 60's, `dark side' period and recent life. Interviews with him, his wife Aline, family and friends reveal the motives behind his astounding creativity. Crumb is sometimes hilarious, often depressing and always entertaining - a rare combination in a documentary film.During childhood, Crumb and his brothers Charles and Maxon found solace from their tyrannical father in comic books and drawing cartoons. Crumb escaped the mental illness that ended both his brother's careers as artists (Charles was equally as talented), but otherwise had a perfectly miserable childhood and adolescence. Socially awkward, bullied at school and rejected by women, he decided in 1962 (at age 17) to take revenge upon society `by becoming a famous artist'.In 1966, his chemically inspired `revelations of some seamy side of America's subconscious' caught the eye of a Haight Street publisher in San Francisco and Zap Comix was born. Zap was an outlet for his creative energy, which was rooted in his social difficulties. He was uninterested in money and once turned down a $100,000 contract - a huge sum of money in those days. Although identified with the hippie crowd, he could not relate to their culture: `My main motivation [for drawing] was to get some of that free love action'.After a few years of fame, he retired from Zap to express the darker side of his nature. His later work frequently contained sadistic and violent themes and was sometimes labeled as pornography by friends and critics alike. Even Crumb isn't sure of his intent: `Maybe I should be locked up and my pencils taken away from me'.Critic Robert Hughes says that in Crumb's world there are no heroes and `even the victims are comic' - ideas that don't jive with traditional American culture. But Crumb has always considered himself to be an outsider and enjoys the feeling of `being very removed or extremely separated from the rest of humanity and the world in general'. `Words fail me, pictures aren't much better' to describe his disgust with American consumerism. He now lives in France because its culture is `slightly less evil than the United States'.The film is embarrassingly candid about unhappy details of Crumb's life, such as his brothers' mental illness, experiments with drugs and ambivalent attitudes towards women. Yet it is apparent that there is no misery or violence in this man - it's all on paper.",1.0,424,0.04018742023496977,0.05059809942792999,0.03409248729469618,0.0,0.07394259754562142,0.3663116044732479,0.06571180992939621,0.12378420301311265,0.10997056681934113,0.06958329939998413,0.04942598997958261,0.0,0.0,0.05716948934211457,0.1149403778012114,0.0,0.0,0.04921880630381723,0.0,0.09014402901223525,0.1140732999119166,0.0,0.055486567021069175,0.1487023217389649,0.04545615831557532,0.0,0.0,0.04548726108452565,0.03939946061515912,0.0,0.2026931879851203,0.0,0.05255889369941295,0.5119558156374927,0.0,0.0,0.324071922433688,0.0,0.1146443512377299,0.04460287032387569,0.051389517205995265,0.0,0.0,0.046316183827283405,0.0,0.09156055851402582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04546651970018337,0.07914380090655172,0.0912872366708094,0.03214750556279704,0.2666238764735389,0.030681428874361105,0.0,0.0,0.08157205762026064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221877151382781,0.0,0.04552881852223561,0.13694666019266716,0.2509181810500574,0.09261060321293864,0.0,0.0,0.07806921463682753,0.0,0.02153772460472937,0.0,0.15545480598351838,0.0,0.0,0.04203212851970438,0.04062070931350506,0.20815672586052508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04579611744179828,0.0,0.0,0.17529540820002867,0.0,0.0,
433672,6304698771,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,48,62,1067990400,Accept No Substitutes,"The Grinch, who lives just north of Whoville, is tired of listening to their Christmas celebration each year.  But this year, he's going to do something about it.  Disguising himself as Santa, he sneaks down into the town to take everything Christmassy, and everything else, from them.  But will that stop Christmas from coming?  Is he beyond enjoying the season himself?What can I say; this is a great holiday special.  There were only a handful I had to watch every year growing up, and this is one of them.  That's extended to my adult Decembers as well.  It keeps the story simple, not trying to expand it needlessly like the recent live action movie did.  And the songs add to the fun, especially ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.""  That song alone is worth watching the special for.This DVD is a great way to own this classic.  The picture and sound are good.  I can't really tell that much difference in how the Grinch is supposed to look, and to me this is a minor issue anyway.  The extras are a mixed bag.  The audio commentary isn't that great because it's obvious that they really don't have that much to say.  However, the special about the making of the cartoon and the separate interview about writing the songs are both interesting.This disc also includes another cartoon from a Dr. Seuss book, HORTON HEARS A WHO.  I had never seen this special before I bought the disc, but I'm not a fan of it.  Not sure why because I like the book.

I sick of seeing bad acting with effects that are just silly. Im tired of them slapping on some white make up on their face and spilling some blood on their shirts and calling some sort of undead. It just does not work! It looks cheap and it is cheap. What was really disapointing is the plot could have work. A agent to reanimate the dead so that they are fast and some what smart as a weapon is a cool story. They would feast on their enemies and not have to use soliders is not a bad script. Then to test it on some small town is great but that is where it begins and end. Not to mention they dont even give you a ending to this film. They actually think that you would want to see sequeal to this. That is how it actually ends. To be continued. You have to be kidding me I bought one copy of this film but I'm sure the hell am not buying or watching another minute of this garbage.

379925,630356643X,A39460B1F5HGSS,1,1,1220918400,"""You agree it's dead now?""","Beware all those who are squeamish or easily offended. Re-Animator is of the old school B-horror movie class that revels in gore, nudity and all around madness. It is the perfect melding of humor and horror, as madly brilliant medical student Herbert West perfects his procedure of reanimating the dead. Once perfected (on a very put-upon cat) West begins to reanimate all the dead bodies he comes across, and since this is a horror movie, he stumbles across quite a few. Again, because it is a horror movie the path to perfect reanimation does not run smooth, and West must face the dire consequences of his actions.The special effects in Re-animator are quite good for 1985, and the tongue-in-cheek tone of the movie makes them even better. They were meant to be laughed at, even in 1985. The acting is much better than the average horror movie, particularly Jeffrey Combs, as the monomaniacal West. In plot, acting and effects the movie is just fine; its in the details that the movie goes gleefully off the rails, making it the most fun horror movie of all time.",1.0,186,0.0,0.0,0.2372115251495693,0.0,0.0,0.2123960958171838,0.11430376521776743,0.10765949449635938,0.06376352472048588,0.06051905377617169,0.085975059283135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15680289340788262,0.0,0.0,0.04825862760689968,0.0,0.0,0.0647665311069762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410315411831474,0.0,0.0,0.13700494141446168,0.0,0.0,0.2601755076762595,0.0,0.23930458201958985,0.11637807624725229,0.08939055727851379,0.0682057849480754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08395933798310531,0.41308270640900335,0.0,0.07908767691321619,0.0,0.0,0.055919642635547016,0.23189220484588205,0.05336944525449364,0.0,0.0,0.07094610034767417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07919604388616752,0.09528587881441017,0.5707616789939736,0.0,0.08484103219425172,0.0,0.0,0.06703533773381926,0.037464239977395786,0.072455536130184,0.11588960295529557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07065853193419602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08210990722366059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06762103756188552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

It's as if a different crew came in to fill in story for the end.  The first hour and a half is really good.  Both leads sizzle in great roles.  The atmosphere is excellent and teeters on the edge of edgy drama and blackest black comedy.  The entire package is marred, however, by a dissapointing third act.  The film flows along and suddenly stops on a dime and changes direction completely.

In this double feature, we are introduced to Chomper, a young T-Rex that was raised by Little Foot and friends when his egg was accidently taken by the gang when they tried to rescue an egg taken by Egg stealers from the nest of Duckie's mother. Little Foot learns responsibility when he realizes that no matter what Chomper is, he's still a baby and needs help to survive, and when he discovers Chomper's real parents, that not all T-Rexes are bad creatures and are very capable of gratitude. This is also the same in the second feature when their food is eaten by Leaf gobblers and they find themselves trapped on a mysterious island after the land bridge they took is washed away in a tsunami. They discover the island is home to the Sharp teeth and they fear being eaten, until they discover one of the inhabitants is Chomper who helps them hide and even tries to find them things to eat. When they are attacked by another Sharp tooth, The Parents come to the rescue and Chomper winds up in the water where Little Foot tries to rescue him. A surprising sea creature turns up to help and Little Foot and the gang gets home again, while Chomper remains behind with his parents after promising to remain friends with the little T- Rex. The songs are catchy and lively and my personal favorite is &#34;Friends for Dinner&#34;, sung in the second feature.",0.0,265,0.0,0.13385130036635445,0.04509382574357686,0.061874854515610145,0.04890160374523945,0.3499289866730881,0.21729104719151898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25338433668518023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05961634745162847,0.0,0.0,0.03669579110977109,0.04917180525873054,0.0,0.049248377217969035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16086027199018188,0.0,0.06951917509771205,0.10417836064680619,0.0,0.0,0.16486423525026592,0.0,0.21229467048024475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039263437071085615,0.0,0.0,0.052341396154448404,0.06037240268600976,0.04252121593266568,0.08816524972823833,0.08116409901483644,0.04333937931115994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07191096452330355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14491049074858647,0.4084765748891574,0.06124760518634096,0.12902599801625964,0.0,0.0,0.3568150216254886,0.08546326278662934,0.05509508559252036,0.29374095871400346,0.0,0.0,0.11119103529850373,0.05372864618325028,0.1179972967002151,0.0,0.0,0.0642900708026551,0.0,0.0,0.05312523735376131,0.3291261134200095,0.0,0.05141893982584289,0.0,0.0772872189571906,0.0,0.0,

That's right, his relationships were so shallow that the depths of judgment found at an afternoon pool dip could change his mind. Presumably, they've been alone at home waiting for however long. This guy's big head also thinks that his choice will inevitably heel when informed. Multiply this gem of a catch by a couple of pals as overly impressed with their worth as he.The bored camera stares at body parts while their listless chatter substitutes for a background of funky 70's porn synth. These characters of average looks and below-average wit are presumed enough to entice our interest. Most people have average looks, and most can tell confidence from denial. As for wit, if camp is no longer the bright and bitter scourge of prejudice but, instead, the splintered, green switch recited here, then return the guilty to the closet and strike them from the lists for recruitment.When Oscar Wilde's farces are played seriously audiences laugh. Without distractions, his famous wit flashes its clever nod to truth. I guess this video might be a great farce--they play it seriously enough--if only someone had put in the clever nods.",0.8,212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168574911234137,0.07246207214993958,0.15954536983952586,0.12879217312508348,0.18195857626366446,0.21553733332985195,0.13638011725085988,0.0,0.09263010317320697,0.0,0.0560248057140213,0.07509264596801092,0.07979952628856465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27187789963373155,0.14572490992170278,0.0,0.0,0.07535575727320061,0.08915297281993356,0.07722115945420753,0.06388021662908364,0.07945389477569842,0.0,0.0,0.38592700992890167,0.0,0.14899948375482042,0.048858946106904964,0.0,0.04493954784775249,0.043709803479773296,0.10072112766214009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892029640911019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08945942595440383,0.0,0.2612853647993898,0.0,0.06422000486813467,0.08878884411397978,0.07993877035563209,0.0,0.0,0.10126886495745928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07194363604010849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16104555318795827,0.3782986749700895,0.18151259043138038,0.0955949341271076,0.09808119223248613,0.0,0.151064609402219,0.21106482677870775,0.0,0.1741053618986771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09251762937368609,0.0,0.1625656307805081,0.0,0.0,0.08409809331313685,0.05726184426915977,0.0,0.0,

Yes, I really do like the 'Rambo' films. This is not some ironic, ""weren't the eighties great"" nostalgia of the type you're seeing pimped all over mainstream broadcast media at the minute. They're great action films with some of the best musical scoring of the last thirty years which were massively influential, and, if we're honest, the originalFirst Bloodis 'the' populist mainstream film that really brought the debate concerning the shameful treatment of returning Vietnam veterans into the public consciousness. I'll take them over the likes of 'The Matrix' et al any day of the week. I also don't buy into the ""they were Reaganite propaganda"" argument. While they may have been a favourite of Teflon Ron's during the eighties, it doesn't hold water if you watch them. True, the Soviets are the enemy 'du jour' in parts two and three, but its hardly as if the American political administration comes across as any better in either of the films. Watch the opening sequences of 'First Blood' again and tell me that Brian Dennehy's agent provocateur sheriff with his ""we don't want long-haired drifters in our town"" wouldn't have been a dyed in the wool Republican; watch the closing soliloquy in the police station and tell me that it is in any way pro-war. Then watch the latest instalment of the series and tell me that any jingoistic war-monger of a president could use it as a military recruiting tool.",1.0,289,0.0,0.0592153633499451,0.039898712510621506,0.0547464534500381,0.0,0.1428991405041539,0.038451530248622585,0.10864923744090382,0.042899813402952486,0.0,0.0,0.11062067290807784,0.05654458084820456,0.033452956950942775,0.0,0.0,0.05582815142162394,0.11520233099199398,0.0,0.0,0.04450030059879234,0.05350305641643339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043574631600519595,0.08999131266724501,0.0,0.0,0.11443049786649125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04608815500497678,0.0,0.13345356361981753,0.20421906688764577,0.167712619203205,0.08050152465782412,0.07829864765298464,0.1202831319016505,0.0,0.04365017633292324,0.0,0.0,0.1607310887829258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037622484722116115,0.338034742940815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352919260146816,0.0,0.12725267162702297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622129061017597,0.0,0.0,0.1602697795876877,0.6324803014636153,0.0,0.11416133176458283,0.0585652348032925,0.0,0.13530322356509306,0.025205772600543675,0.0,0.025990001671112904,0.0,0.0594038338607616,0.0,0.04753874332686781,0.0,0.22094589422446637,0.11692561617384527,0.17065026153439694,0.0,0.11048635450659379,0.0,0.0,0.10719113029909261,0.0,0.0,0.10257481414817546,0.0,0.07503191006770189,

He has his well-meaning but ungrateful and incompetent children - and his lackadaisacal, expectant, spoilt-rotten grandkids......but......he also has the lively foreign family who has just moved next door...and his precious 1970s hotrod...REVIEWI'm not sure where to start...but, as usual, I'll aim for sharp and concise.Clint Eastwood has ripened with age, in terms of both directing and acting. To say that ""Gran Torino"", supposedly his last effort on both fronts, is thereby his greatest achievement, is hardly a stretch. Eastwood's directing demands attention from the audience at every turn, while his portrayal of the central character either cracks a smile on your face or makes your teeth grind...or both. From the supporting cast - and supporting crew behind the seens - he demands, at the very least, a raw and earnest performance.Nevermind the racism of the central character, nevermind the simplicity of the picture - all elements are inhabited with a sense of perfection, and the dialogue is exemplary. So many films could learn a lesson from the dialogue...""Gran Torino"" runs long, as does heavyweight peer ""Slumdog Millionaire"". But whereas during ""Slumdog Millionaire"" I checked my watch - just the once, mind you - time LITERALLY FLEW during ""Gran Torino"".This movie is gripping...mesmerizing...and, like Eastwood's other recent hit ""Million Dollar Baby"", as observed by John Walker in Halliwells (2006-2008), it also ""...moves in unexpected directions...""",1.0,249,0.0,0.0,0.0559351504728202,0.15350124948347246,0.0,0.33389067898739305,0.05390630411430785,0.1523184850487663,0.12028495993755452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18759464284103164,0.06286045047734767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04551808509475586,0.18298063742522944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2585689614262588,0.0,0.1995338246533949,0.0,0.0,0.4522861531364528,0.0,0.0,0.16360032717115094,0.0,0.15047653125241814,0.03658970730882701,0.0,0.12866494043345902,0.06119443530157069,0.0,0.08241605228505695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048703036933257046,0.0,0.0,0.06492516040898544,0.0,0.0527440413906269,0.25517725173330474,0.10067733257323858,0.0,0.0,0.13383433358576544,0.0766407721366286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06022439763790037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04493736099928803,0.44334614586929344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03533669621093087,0.0683408837488023,0.07287225891690326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664592900257743,0.0,0.0774375979958459,0.0,0.0,0.06954636664348421,0.0,0.0658974504000738,0.0,0.0,0.06378092984760965,0.0,0.09586838443424894,0.0,0.05259469436241519,

American Beauty, Magnolia, Fight Club, and this little masterpiece. I can't believe it did not get a nomination. If you read some of the reviews before  mine, you will see that the ones that did not like the film didn't like  that it changed moods throughout, from comedy to action to drama. That is  the best part! You don't have any idea what will happen next, but you can't  wait until it does. I did not have this on my short list to see last fall,  but when I did, I was blown away by every scene and every shot. Smart,  funny and eventually very moving.

997800,B000G0O5EG,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,15,15,1163289600,Hmm...Very Interesting....,"Like most of the other reviewers, I remember watching Dick Cavett's show all those years ago. It was sometimes quite entertaining, frequently irritating, but a slightly more highbrow alternative to the antics of Johnny Carson. The best thing about the show was the quality of the guests - not all of the time, but often enough to make watching the show regularly worthwhile. This set of Hollywood Greats contains some of the more memorable interviews, most of them devoted to a single guest.In the Cavett/Osborne interview that is a mildly interesting extra, Cavett quotes his idol Jack Paar's rule that talk shows should be conversations rather than interviews. This is, apparently, easier said than done. When Cavett and his guests click - such as Bette Davis and Orson Welles - they are an absolute delight. Some of the other guests such as Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, are pleasant and genial and give the viewer a totally different impression of these actors than one might get from their films. Fred Astaire, on the other hand, seemed awkward and uncomfortable - probably preferring dance to conversation. And John Huston, who had a reputation as a witty raconteur, is a big disappointment - stumbling over words and not being overly forthcoming in his answers until the end when he wastes far too much time expounding his rather crackpot views about Northern Ireland.Cavett says the Hitchcock interview is the one fans most ask to see again, but I have no idea why. It comes across as very strained and stilted. Hitchcock is his usual po-faced self, telling familiar anecdotes with his trademark dry wit. But Cavett's interview seems completely disorganized and he often appears not to know what to say or do next. Similarly, the Brando interview was full of false starts and awkward pauses - it was the only one that I turned off half way through. The show with the four film directors was an interesting experiment. Mel Brooks, who had only directed two films at that point, plays court jester while Frank Capra is the wise old man that the others pay obvious homage to. Robert Altman says very little - it is Peter Bogdonovich who comes off best.The viewer's response to the Katharine Hepburn shows will be in direct proportion to how much they like her in the first place. Personally, I found her alternately amusing and irritating in roughly equal measures, but my wife loved her.Then there's Cavett himself. For me, he has always been a very difficult person to like. In interviews like these in particular, he is much too starstruck by his guests to be a really effective interviewer - he is never inclined to probe beneath the charm and anecdotes. And he tries too hard to be a combination of the brainy Ivy Leaguer and the shy kid from the Midwest. While his guests occasionally let the public image slip, Cavett is always the facade. And his little introductions to each show demonstrate that he hasn't changed very much over the years.The other thing about seeing all these shows together is that you realize how much Cavett recycled the same questions. For instance, he asked every actor (Hepburn included) if they thought that acting was an ""un-masculine"" profession and never got a single sensible answer. (I remember David Frost used to ask every guest: ""What is your definition of love?"" with similar results.)All in all, I'm very glad to have got this DVD set and will certainly enjoy watching parts of it again.

1133700,B001209SMS,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,1,3,1204502400,A Bare Bones Adaptation of a Great Musical,"I saw the original production of Sweeney Todd - well the first national company (the production that was filmed at the end the LA run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn) and fell in love with the grissly show.  It had style and flair and could not wait until the right director came along and filmed it.Ten years ago when I heard that Tim Burton was interested in doing a movie of it, I knew he was the only director that could pull it off.  When Johnny Depp was announced as the lead, I first thought he was too young but then realized he was probably the correct age for the role.  Then I heard about the trimming of the show.  But I decided to wait and see the results.The final verdict is this film was one of the best films of 2007.  Tim Burton did a masterful job of directing this difficult film.  While I did not agree with all the cuts, the only real complaint I had is the cut of the Prologue - The Ballad of Sweeney Todd.  This could have been put over the opening credits.  But this is a minor quibble. (By the way Burton should have won the Oscar for Direction)Johnny Depp proved that he was up to the role of the Demon Barber.  He took the role and ran with it.  He created a three dimensional character who you sympathize with even though he does terrible things.  (Depp also should have won the Oscar for this performance.)The only problem in casting was Helena Bonham Carter, she either hit musical sequences perfectly (A Little Priest) or totally missed it (The Worst Pies in London).  She is a great actress but just did not have the musical background for the role.  Mrs. Lovett is one of the most difficult roles in musical theatre.  She is a real monster.  She doesn't have the sympathetic backstory that Benjamin Barker has and it takes a very skilled actress (like Tony winner Angela Lansbury) to pull it off and Carter just came up short.In the supporting roles, Timothy Spall was perfectly sleazy as Beedle Bamford, Alan Rickman was incredibly slimey as Judge Turpin and newcomer Ed Sanders was beautifly naive as the innocent helper Toby.  Sasha Baron Cohen has a too brief but crucial appearance as Signor Perelli, a former protoge of Barker and Todd's first vicitim.  Laura Michelle Kelly portrays the Beggar woman - in a role drastically cut down from the stage version.  Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener portray the star crossed lovers Anthony and Joanna.And for those that want to better understand film making technique, this is a film that is technically flawless.  This is a film in which the most important element is the lack of color, from the production design and costumes to the cinematography.  The choice of the exclusion of color created the bleak period that it takes place.While I would have liked a more complete version, this is a great bare bones production. For those that want a more complete production, the Angela Lansbury - George Hearn TV production filmed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion is available.Once again, if you want to see a great musical, a grizzly comedy or have a bloody good time, this is the film!!!!",0.3333333333333333,553,0.027930766797631675,0.0,0.023694711096453543,0.032512362340232526,0.0,0.21215934281564028,0.0,0.10753948895497405,0.076430938798147,0.0,0.0,0.03284723642591745,0.03358021908380113,0.09933380056607986,0.026628340155756464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03132562177191941,0.15856478067251273,0.09532183256994749,0.11569160360172168,0.05167499986902989,0.0,0.02587773494279662,0.08016492340222793,0.06322844682174102,0.05476624973488105,0.1585663790357173,0.1972240712335249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026418092512984884,0.13860559790535779,0.0,0.20716612345226268,0.13949802276601694,0.0,0.05450380603328524,0.025922598811741936,0.03219033523108318,0.0,0.0,0.05605884009248193,0.06709260036517381,0.020631112634874948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06702877236832866,0.21619147198488992,0.0,0.04554566195900217,0.094455303017715,0.05669361470015214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060782325977180474,0.0,0.14468414083376638,0.07378509386118393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17132339853976172,0.6707358402224062,0.0,0.0,0.06956045604682426,0.0,0.0,0.13472092604903335,0.028949908649857664,0.09260833880232476,0.0688304672791477,0.0,0.05842572490733702,0.028231908203020992,0.24800839665925714,0.0,0.03471939970840582,0.0,0.029460563733105967,0.0,0.0,0.05764682890389229,0.03182888249668665,0.027018264783906003,0.0,0.10152711011106813,0.030355382234466485,0.04455931833880588,
179091,1558807780,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,5,5,1246147200,Classic for a reason.,"Double Indemnity (Billy Wilder, 1944)About twenty years ago, noir started coming back into vogue in the literary world, a trend which has continued to this day. When Vintage Books starts reprinting Jim Thompson, you know it's suddenly big. For some reason, while some authors (like Thompson) who had fallen into obscurity were spotlighted along with the guys who never go out of style (e.g. Raymond Chandler--who wrote the film adaptation here with Billy Wilder), James M. Cain never really returned to the prominence he enjoyed during the early part of the last century. I still don't understand why, given that some of Cain's novels were turned into the most enduring movies of the twentieth century. In fact, between 1943 and 1947, at least one movie now considered a classic was made form a Cain novel. '43 brought us Ossessione, directed by the great Luchino Visconti and based on The Postman Always Rings Twice, adapted in America in 1946. 1945 saw an adaptation of Mildred Pierce. 1947 gave us one of the definitive noir films, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past. In each of these cases, magic happened. But in 1944, the gods must have been smiling on Cain. Billy Wilder, arguably the greatest director in American history, helmed an adaptation of Wilder's best novel, Double Indemnity. According to the AFI, the result is the twenty-ninth greatest movie in American history.Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray in the role of his career) is an insurance salesman who finds himself entangled in a nasty plot with bored, unhappy housewife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She wants to get rid of her husband, and Neff knows the loopholes to get her the maximum from his insurance policies. Problem is, she can't do the deed on her own, and ropes Neff into being more of an accessory than he ever bargained for.The promise of possible sex makes people do really, really dumb things. At its base, this is the entire premise of every noir film ever made. Stupid choices are a staple, and, at least in the classics, the characters are so exquisitely drawn that we have no choice but to understand that, in their minds, there are no choices to be made but the stupid ones. Are these people nuts? Maybe so, but it all looks very reasonable, at least while the movie is playing out. Even when you know that things will not end well, you understand why it is these characters are doing what they're doing. There were a host of actors considered for the part of Walter Neff, including most of the leading actors of the day (William Powell was so disgusted that he wouldn't be let out of his contract to play the role that he ended up tearing it to shreds, or so the story goes), but I'm not sure anyone would have worked here as well as does MacMurray, whose down-home boy-next-door looks give just the right air of naivet&eacute; to Neff's eternal optimism. Stanwyck's performance is nothing short of jaw-dropping, and that cheap wig everyone made such fun of is the feminine side to MacMurray's looks; it's obvious Phyllis is the average American housewife, but the wig makes her seedy, rather than glamorous. There's a bit of the low-rent district in middle-class America here, and what a fine piece it is.If pressed to name my favorite noir film, the one that always comes to mind first in Sunset Blvd., but when you're trying to decide whether it or Double Indemnity (or a handful of others) is better, you're really splitting hairs. All of them really are just that good. I do have to admit I sometimes wonder about the ending; there's just something a bit too noble about it for noir. But it's impossible to fault this movie for anything, as is usually the case when Billy Wilder turned his attention to something. Double Indemnity, sixty years later, is still one for the ages. **** ",1.0,656,0.0808074305134574,0.0,0.045701304570592044,0.0,0.09912075766026245,0.09548081697545033,0.13213096246876316,0.06222521453953517,0.09827772952964182,0.0466385384471507,0.0,0.03167714411229479,0.03238401628213352,0.1532724920880536,0.025679778890608566,0.027289412488389467,0.09592111591521464,0.032989139778042305,0.0,0.030209732788764265,0.07645817357916904,0.03064208495567446,0.11157040891825529,0.024917110173726793,0.06093441402007482,0.02495591192067353,0.025769756278590995,0.030488053789336632,0.026407676476139008,0.08738165061957513,0.10868486113576538,0.1312374540367955,0.0,0.10558179331818696,0.0,0.025477020740943025,0.23391927176772515,0.1280690529967513,0.1997864009833358,0.1345287899791976,0.034444069118011233,0.07884338712689962,0.024999177637873852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027030949169539457,0.06470261129667779,0.07958474431855232,0.032670038363293054,0.0,0.026523255100452274,0.06118570596562803,0.04309403799759581,0.37230401131527174,0.061693122308486135,0.08784644643205335,0.0,0.08201109127494001,0.0,0.1066199362027227,0.06926276274026297,0.0,0.14823220053051905,0.0,0.0,0.06976508343847318,0.0,0.09841158969859329,0.08266128588448407,0.02879542629504162,0.061031815720515165,0.16522047441014104,0.5304110333403348,0.031036349352539055,0.03269104104404805,0.0,0.10465252725223236,0.025830131017741047,0.043307288057773966,0.0,0.2530433618800852,0.03318928574456555,0.0,0.028172234701222855,0.027226224243526893,0.03986229678587554,0.0,0.0,0.03257807535919233,0.05682222460984264,0.09491604278313577,0.05384091087093152,0.11118663884700873,0.030695066236540447,0.10422325411201162,0.028759413302909962,0.05874629189362554,0.029274055362121087,0.10743003842556514,

590025,B00005JKNF,A3U20DIY3TCSNI,6,13,1026172800,Entertaining but unsurprising,"Period pieces are not everybody's thing.  I know grown men who would gladly eat glass rather than sit through one.  And really, can you blame them?  Costume dramas are almost always boringly similar.  People wear fancy clothes, sip tea, become attracted to people they shouldn't become attracted to, and say things like, ""I love Lord Fibberbush, but he's not of my class!  Oh, the pain!"".  If you're a historian, it's usually fun.  If you're a normal person, it's usually agony.So it's pleasing to report that Robert Altman's Gosford Park is a refreshingly entertaining period piece, filled with snappy dialogue (when you can follow it), murder, sex, and an attractive, if not downright exhaustive, cast.  It's also refreshing to see that the notion of servants having more integrity than the people they serve has been debunked here.  Here, both upstairs and downstairs feature characters who lie, gossip, and backstab.  Altman's direction, as always, make you feel like a voyeur, like you're watching something you're not supposed to.  And that's the fun - you're peeking in on one nasty cocktail party, which is always amusing.But, this being Altman, it's an acquired taste.  His overlapping dialogue and low sound mix combine with a broad range of dialects to make viewers strain to hear everything.  You're not supposed to hear everything, of course, but not everyone will know that, and it could be annoying after a while.  The film is also a bit of a puff piece.  It doesn't say anything particularly new about class struggles back in 1930's England, then again it doesn't try.  The reason Gosford Park feels like more than what is actually is is more a tribute to the cast, particularly Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith (who could do her part in her sleep), Michael Gambon, and Clive Owen.  Owen, in particular, has ""movie star"" written all over him.  He has a presence that trumps everyone else on screen, and it should serve him well if, as rumored, he becomes the next James Bond.Overall, Gosford Park is a nice, airy entertainment brought to a higher level by the skill of its stars and its director.  It makes for a nice evening diversion.  That is, if you haven't got any fox hunts scheduled.",0.46153846153846156,371,0.04791101989370414,0.06032252217487972,0.040644704921385034,0.11154011274808821,0.08815358739841968,0.266880071110948,0.07834092893673833,0.07378711271353162,0.0,0.04147823899033511,0.0,0.05634448238595355,0.0,0.10223529621339794,0.04567690332966248,0.0970799523987576,0.05687197902023133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04533232961513109,0.0,0.03307525092225907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14091486815753712,0.0,0.14498921262066497,0.1167167467992103,0.1253203209810638,0.04694987238121174,0.0,0.226581275966018,0.11887850424474274,0.0,0.21868446437164796,0.2924629018732576,0.12253208425863728,0.0,0.17786524177649,0.05521766741370684,0.0,0.0,0.14424073400931228,0.0,0.03538956359631911,0.0,0.0,0.047177203681235645,0.0,0.22995550889507732,0.15893309119086638,0.07315615386964584,0.07812671710734079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18479764943708393,0.0,0.05273244697953244,0.052131458655929774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043761442498488415,0.0,0.0,0.16283693632498103,0.1959196421916477,0.2070983197520867,0.0,0.05814791193786732,0.0596602380740424,0.0,0.0918886726023453,0.0256770488368992,0.0,0.2647594075992987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050535155920469116,0.0,0.04788370825754863,0.04944222237854087,0.05459764973664921,0.13903728074499352,0.051154682711666316,0.06966178089595636,0.052070082166159354,0.38217396658824393,

1257476,B0029WLJHK,AI0BCEWRE04G0,0,1,1327968000,WHAT IS IT?,"Another Stargate Movie?  A remake of ""Stargate"" The Movie?NOPE, NEITHER.  But it does sound familiar, doesn't it?  This is the first episode of SG-1, also known as the ""pilot"" (I thought ""Stargate The Movie"" was the pilot).  If you've got SG-1 Season 1 or the entire series (and who doesn't?), then you've already got the original version of ""Children of the Gods"".  It has been remastered, and tinkered with, but it is still low-definition DVD, not High-Def Blu-ray.  In my opinion the ""tinkering"" promises more than it delivers (i.e., the improvement isn't that obvious, because the story defines the movie), and I object to anything being deleted from the original, particularly for the sake of polical correctness.  I'll wait for the Blu-ray, hopefully with the cut scenes restored---maybe they can call it the ""Re-Extended Edition"", or ""Final Re-Edit""By the way ""The Movie"" although long available on Blu-ray, has been re-mastered yet again asStargate (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] ---so the old Blu-ray extended cut is selling for a buck or twoStargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray].  True, the original Blu-ray sufferes from some minor defects if you look hard on a big screen, but again it is the story which defines the movie.  The most eggredious ""defect"" of the movie (preserved in the original blue-ray) was crappy camera techinique--lotsa lens flair which washes out many scenes---which no ""remastering"" can recover.  So I don't plan on buying the 15th Anniversery edition.  If you still haven't yet upgraded from a ""full screen"" DVD original cut, the original blu-ray extended cut that people are virtually giving away is a good opportunity.On the otherhand, every dollar which is spent purchasing re-releases of re-releases of Stargate anything probably matters to an accountant somewhere who is considering the profitablility of bringing back SGU---so, by all means, buy every new Stargate anything anybody offers for sale.  Buy two or three of each.",0.0,312,0.0,0.0,0.03958434474931182,0.05431509817745501,0.04292689541253931,0.0708866086918335,0.03814856504692658,0.03593105809672136,0.0,0.0,0.05738787581017019,0.1097490765304397,0.0,0.0995681287067209,0.08897052110377261,0.09454728017910408,0.0,0.05714731753183061,0.10970905212089559,0.0,0.0,0.05308149804999782,0.12884946639018005,0.12949225260078068,0.0,0.04323130073783817,0.0,0.0,0.0914924052590332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13240206357397535,0.057888570041389656,0.0,0.18635689667400987,0.18125734950243313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05832442389002329,0.0,0.0468259022748642,0.0560423930085467,0.24126411596388037,0.0,0.0,0.04594642028866025,0.05299621315913058,0.03732605169075323,0.2579779369351073,0.14249523626316843,0.0,0.0,0.1894245158964076,0.0,0.04617461527032654,0.059992184126065544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06312501465572458,0.0,0.0,0.12785931377318913,0.047731574530418285,0.09976503667685649,0.052862920585245866,0.06360279626974284,0.6723181040782632,0.0,0.0,0.05810379079677761,0.0,0.04474571659313613,0.025007172650673,0.0,0.05157044533257285,0.0,0.058935782410253046,0.0,0.0,0.06905373548075239,0.0,0.058002171115409555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21269311157336845,0.0902733359677385,0.0,0.06784440817494299,0.0,0.1488814454616098,

The sequel starts out with irony and ends with irony (How ironic).  Although Seth died tragically, I had higher hopes for his son, and the movie delivered.  There's a good feeling of hope at the end, which surprises me for a Cronenberg Sci-Fi.  My advice for all those bashing Fly II out there is to examine the character Martin/Stolz a little closer.  In spite of the forces of evil working against him, he prevailed, and it started because he found friendship with a dog, the only creature at the time that cared for him.  Unlike most gory movies, this ones a little deeper than you think - maybe that's why these critics are disappointed.",0.5,134,0.0,0.0,0.09310153061749797,0.0,0.0,0.1667237846499422,0.17944921504816852,0.0,0.20020888092349703,0.0,0.1349750541697831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13440926625392996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3030511838997203,0.0,0.0,0.10167909295373842,0.0,0.12421896923976924,0.0,0.0,0.22141002366924098,0.0,0.2870610999238519,0.10754426657646049,0.13341792315237058,0.0,0.06807633813624403,0.0,0.0626153468042398,0.060901914565392096,0.0,0.0,0.101855372582185,0.0,0.13717779518478293,0.1250191584463089,0.0,0.13181050745203443,0.08106400440292136,0.13310913574717495,0.0,0.10806499595634965,0.0,0.0,0.18202757387783017,0.0,0.0,0.12371162000515037,0.11138060057657469,0.0,0.2172034113267081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10024078872067893,0.0,0.0,0.12433245644373575,0.22438862087147077,0.3689648139398188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131954560536089,0.0,0.05881633420834044,0.11375031312122237,0.060646291172623344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250624101818885,0.0,0.0,0.23935289133598567,0.0,0.08754149235514627,

So if your a fan of the series I definately suggest you watch this movie...",0.0,104,0.0,0.0,0.09327063479422648,0.0,0.10114652169258194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15640497320447297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10402769974791362,0.2501466198471235,0.07590040708781959,0.0,0.0,0.10186377691317927,0.0,0.2488891866252571,0.0,0.08916749860024296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10399081249433342,0.0,0.130686443010085,0.0,0.3050626662108965,0.0,0.10727298101952346,0.20408075345127238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32484497728338796,0.1333509073986857,0.0,0.10826127889663177,0.0,0.0,0.24314426416024684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487383516291915,0.0,0.0,0.100422860228406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36963498005512596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784632951781472,0.0,0.18226933665007733,0.0,0.0,0.11499200028726668,0.0,0.1627079034398908,0.12912549373621998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11345899732335103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07992921264441989,0.11948935603835398,0.35080199041384336,

I&#8217;m going to honest right up front and tell you that I enjoyed KNIGHT OF THE DEAD.  If you&#8217;d truly like to know why, as well as what I found sub-par to the whole experience, then you&#8217;re free to go ahead and read on, especially after the below disclaimer.  The short story?  I tend to enjoy B movies.  In fact, I tend to enjoy them more than the average bloke?  And do you want to know why?  That&#8217;s because I can relate to the minds who conceive, pen, and complete B movies.  They&#8217;re generally folks like me &#8211; folks who&#8217;d love nothing more than getting together with a bunch of friends and a camcorder and making their own tidy, little epic.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be all that inspired.  The dirty little secret is there&#8217;s more heart and soul in the frames they shoot than in anything I&#8217;ve ever seen from Spike Lee.Now, as promised, here&#8217;s my personal disclaimer &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)A band of knights tasked with escorting the Holy Grail through a dark country get more than they bargained for when the earn the ire of &#8216;an area man&#8217; who happens to be a bit of a local warlord.  Their only escape is through the Valley of the Black Death, a zombie-infested wasteland with more nooks, crannies, and crevasses than any God-made world should have.  And, by the way, night is falling &#8230; so they&#8217;d best be on their way &#8230;I won&#8217;t trouble you with the usual particulars I cite while talking about KNIGHT OF THE DEAD.  This isn&#8217;t out of any disrespect to these players; rather, everyone turns in a serviceable performance in a relatively serviceable picture.  Besides, these are probably a lot of faces you&#8217;ve never seen before and are unlikely to ever see again.  Once more, I say that because of the craziness of this industry, not as any reflection on their work.  All that truly matters is what they achieve in KNIGHT OF THE DEAD, and I found that to be an unbridled assault on the senses of the viewer.Writer/director Mark Atkins &#8211; a man who has undoubtedly cut his teeth on B movies &#8211; knew exactly what he wanted with KNIGHT, and it&#8217;s clear to this reviewer that he no doubt achieved it.  His band of brothers &#8211; each one flawed more than the last with blood lust and a bad accent &#8211; remain dedicated to one another in much the same way Spielberg&#8217;s troops did in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, only the stakes here are a bit more medieval and &#8211; shall we say &#8211; less organic?  They&#8217;re squaring their shoulders against zombies at a time when no one knew what a zombie was which only serves to heighten the tension.  Granted, it would&#8217;ve been nice if the zombie make-up would&#8217;ve appeared more &#8211; erm &#8211; zombie-like; and it also would&#8217;ve been nice if there could&#8217;ve been greater consistency to what type of zombie they are (the slow, lumbering type versus ones who can run, jump, and fight); but that&#8217;s chump change in a world whose currency was how hard you can swing an axe or how quickly you can cleave a man&#8217;s skull from his shoulders.To Atkins&#8217; credit, he gets terrific mileage out of these shooting locations.  Everything is draped in shades of gray, and he manages to instill a lifeless countryside as yet one more zombie in the mix.  Others might dismiss that a camera trickery, but, as one who takes his B movies seriously, that&#8217;s a gift, and it&#8217;s one that kept on giving through this dark and treacherous KNIGHT.KNIGHT OF THE DEAD (2013) is produced by Paradise City Pictures and Automatic Entertainment GL.  DVD distribution is being handled by Inception Media Group.  As for the technical specifications &#8230; yeah, alright, you got me.  The sights and sounds here?  They left something to be desired.  There&#8217;s some noticeable graininess throughout, and whoever held the boom mike should probably be drawn and quartered at the earliest convenience.  But ask me if I feel like I honestly missed that much, and I&#8217;ll happily tell you, &#8220;No.&#8221;  This was a picture a five-year-old could understand, so if that makes me a five-year-old, then so be it!  Special features?  Nada.  Big miss &#8216;cause I would&#8217;ve liked to have seen something.RECOMMENDED &#8230; but only if you&#8217;re a true purveyor of B movies.  The rest of you?  Hate me if you want &#8211; even vote this review &#8216;unhelpful&#8217; if you must &#8211; but I actually enjoyed quite a bit of KNIGHT OF THE DEAD.  Yes, yes, and yes!  Of course, it wasn&#8217;t exactly smartly made.  Of course, it&#8217;s occasionally grainy, and, yes, it&#8217;s very hard to hear lines of dialogue over some muddled accents and gritty sound work.  But &#8211; and here&#8217;s the real trick to getting any thumbs up as a B movie &#8211; it kept my interest in spite of all of those glaring and obvious weaknesses.  Truth be told, I&#8217;ve seen films from mainstream directors that have had me reaching for the fast forward button on the remote, but methinks KNIGHT&#8217;s makers knew exactly what audience they were trying to please.  They found it in me.  Will they find it in you?In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Inception Media Group provided me with an advance DVD copy of KNIGHT OF THE DEAD by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",0.7142857142857143,978,0.01824417224039177,0.02297038315976187,0.046431635074194476,0.02123683688224144,0.06713650578398724,0.27716185672819194,0.05966332606423858,0.11239041009383904,0.06656550567963508,0.14215153929973495,0.04487654440454586,0.06436672254477334,0.021934353083600488,0.09083775507958965,0.069573746800042,0.07393469713570881,0.02165644111102284,0.0,0.04289549908912551,0.020461666637549097,0.0,0.0,0.07556890787029559,0.05063059698450938,0.02063605916595349,0.0,0.0,0.02065017911370244,0.017886456543831832,0.07398171219018208,0.07361446765048711,0.0,0.0,0.0715126966854486,0.044358829040944604,0.17256104480109313,0.1697553020108714,0.0,0.07286428910827956,0.14174080114940757,0.0,0.0,0.06772980649855935,0.02102649113384279,0.0,0.1662656214496484,0.1830861181961072,0.0,0.013476091621426491,0.11064040829157348,0.04128152599651114,0.05389422089261,0.06216348521878095,0.02918846868783405,0.34294995073430895,0.11142935171102941,0.08925027811837438,0.08226334921912269,0.03703185376234232,0.0,0.03610792599112731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01985128500649234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04999212892159727,0.037325447120550144,0.01950372807515847,0.12401427145578463,0.18651198123889492,0.3943077630820065,0.1051077542689089,0.022142307201291473,0.09087276052486112,0.053162464404732164,0.192448005801093,0.06844345034843,0.01890986823163034,0.3024554421021896,0.0,0.0,0.057244883189328716,0.01844087560011128,0.0404993169226073,0.0,0.06803537256451621,0.02206579324464172,0.019243424390747447,0.021429522284136207,0.10940263299310614,0.03765448629660191,0.020790392855880364,0.1235369282726324,0.0389586714858003,0.0928434702956186,0.07931165312017052,0.2765052926576747,

1618472,B00AYGVCCK,A394AF4TZK8WJO,0,0,1378857600,Disturbing,"I gave this three stars because the acting was excellent. The plot is about a young woman who looks anorexic and has a sexual problem, which I believe comes from the familiarity with her father.

You can however, take a book and make a movie that stays true to form and does its best to keep up with the pace of the original novel. In that category we have: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.The acting in this movie was great. I feel that Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and even Tom Felton  (though he is a bit of a cry baby at times in this one) shine in this movie especially.Harry Potter is growing up rapidly as he is now 16 and set to start another year at Hogwarts. Dumbledore meets Harry outside of the wizarding world and then asks a favor of Harry. From there, we meet a new professor, Horace Slughorn. Not long after these series of events while Harry is on his way to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione, suspicions arise after seeing Draco and Narcissa talking to what appears to be Death Eaters. And that is only the beginning of the mystery.Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince deals with issues such as: love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The tone of the movie overall can be described as engagingly humorous, eagerly romantic, but as serious as the book is; some even argue that this is one of the darker stories in the series, I can be inclined to agree tremendously. It is an enjoyable 153 minute movie.Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince's final score:5 stars",0.0,268,0.0,0.13725139328890368,0.0,0.0,0.050143803083911614,0.38641926455954895,0.0,0.25183091641967936,0.099434653918993,0.14156270048082523,0.0,0.0,0.06553048115646097,0.038769203559694675,0.0,0.16566397897606427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12226144577058089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05042086826067059,0.0,0.0,0.05214623515219972,0.0,0.053437094726890864,0.13261545972539746,0.10996429816796999,0.0,0.0,0.05341235053448242,0.0,0.0,0.2028625431027618,0.0,0.24878558077057183,0.030247213659457213,0.13939817733694457,0.0,0.0,0.06281817730302545,0.0,0.0,0.054698314432760034,0.0,0.24156484525296198,0.0,0.0,0.053670973156195775,0.0,0.043601340555699857,0.2712144745343072,0.04161291539318139,0.08888057386744978,0.061441940358632686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14747529604207382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11151249821990157,0.0,0.061750281607663625,0.26003514146088946,0.36649611558850426,0.0,0.0,0.06787225156029665,0.052942247846370416,0.0,0.11684560264886391,0.0,0.210841799948285,0.0,0.0,0.11401551179693596,0.0,0.040331555320722176,0.0,0.06775354748810603,0.1318463364667423,0.0,0.0,0.05447472550248216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11887570523706398,0.0,0.0869557629585106,

967744,B000E40PYS,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,7,7,1166832000,largely speculative true life account,"On March 16, 1978, Aldo Moro, the Prime Minister of Italy, was kidnapped by a group of Communist revolutionaries known as the Red Brigade and held in captivity for 55 days.  Through letters and photos sent by the kidnappers, the authorities learned that Moro had been given a ""trial"" by the Red Brigade and sentenced to death for his crimes against the proletariat of Italy - and, indeed, on May 9th of that year, his body was found, riddled with ten rounds of bullets, in the trunk of an abandoned car.In ""Good Morning, Night,"" writer/director Marco Bellochio takes the events and drains them of much of their sociopolitical significance, choosing instead to focus on the human drama at the story's core.  Bellochio looks at the ambivalent feelings and conflicted motives underlying the kidnappers' actions, particularly in the case of an attractive young woman named Chiara (confidently played by Maya Sansa), who comes to question her commitment to ""the cause"" as the reality of what they are planning to do begins to sink in.  It is largely through her eyes that we come to view the events and to see Moro less as an impersonal force to be manipulated for political purposes and more as a simple human being with all the fears, insecurities and desperate desire for life common to us all.  Indeed, the political aspects stay largely in the background, relegated mainly to clips of stock footage showing us the principal players of the time dealing with the crisis.With its dreamy visions, fantasy sequences, and tendency towards wild speculation, the film may frustrate those who would have preferred a more historically accurate, documentary-style approach to the topic.  But Bellochio, as an artist, is less concerned with the ""facts"" of the case than with exploring the dilemma of the revolutionary's mindset.  And to that end, he has done an exemplary job in ""Good Morning, Night.""",1.0,315,0.0,0.0,0.0768375427634628,0.0,0.2083144979948814,0.2522642114928248,0.03702526866014277,0.17436528446585517,0.08261710815897676,0.0392066564185601,0.0,0.05325874038438402,0.0,0.032212104708868275,0.1727015127645266,0.0,0.053757348324487135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04284967527882509,0.0,0.12505545369646348,0.0,0.0,0.08391668322920796,0.0,0.051259524401418184,0.044399191436314295,0.03672866332432898,0.04568292822123372,0.11032467870959972,0.0,0.08875726453933243,0.0,0.0,0.19664408069454167,0.0,0.051677017078122944,0.025131452908227343,0.05791076772687784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908941979782338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05123615096737395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35053437465674053,0.10372456471713438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049276445622430144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048413712040096764,0.051306355413916295,0.12345998422361508,0.6090200554444077,0.052181373004656806,0.05496340395106622,0.0,0.0,0.04342816502307591,0.0,0.046939585691228754,0.32533759373607285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06702042671896703,0.0,0.0,0.05477347489493834,0.0,0.0,0.045261326020560426,0.0,0.0,0.08761520945653826,0.0,0.1975401252976899,0.04921843045579862,0.0,
1160752,B0018PH3NS,A2KUPHNY30CRYG,3,3,1256428800,A Superb Wing Chun Made Superior,"This is an exhilirating and highy entertaining movie. A raging unstoppable river of [...]-kicking. The biggest box-office hit in Vietnamese history and one of the year's most talked-about films. The REBEL is a sweeping martial arts epics  set in the 20's French-occupied Vietnam. Johnny Tri Ngujen (the Protector) starts as an elite double agent tasked with taking down his own country's freedom fighters. However, when he meets a beautiful rebel (pop star Veronica Ngo), he rethinks his loyalthy to the oppressive French regime and fights back against his sadistic captain (Dustin Tri Nguyen, TV's 21 Jumped Street). Featuring an acrobatic fighting style rarely seen in the US and an absolutely gripping story, THE REBEL is entertaining mix of martial arts and historical drama. CAVEAT: I looked at the movie over and over again because of its unique martial arts style. An article that Vietnamese martial style (yes it has a name, as Israel martial art also has a name but I forget)is an improvemnent of ""Wing Chun"" appeared sometime ago in TIME magazine. But, Wing Chun seldom kicks above the belt and in order to maintain balance, acrobatics is largely avoided. Tae Kwon Do, which is 70% kicking has a similar but distinctly different kick. My best bet is that the kicking style of Vietnamese martial art is derived from Savate.The closest I have seen such kicking is from the later part of ""Kyokushinkai Karate Complete"", a martial arts renowned for its brutality.",1.0,243,0.07180202370027979,0.0,0.0,0.08357999722024834,0.39633508026059194,0.2545205003982264,0.0,0.11058132403748763,0.06549403767753008,0.0,0.08830838315009976,0.0,0.08632515190095398,0.15321529739933895,0.0,0.0,0.08523139758978643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04956834473325044,0.13284166497078237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2111825781546107,0.05823269570220484,0.14485907283920307,0.0,0.0,0.21108478948601117,0.0,0.0,0.2226971268346055,0.0,0.3686987987231168,0.03984550803921288,0.18363315240424433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623795609403193,0.1060733956289407,0.0,0.0,0.07070228737247441,0.0,0.0,0.27788326234877436,0.0,0.05854244394934586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07675914955439322,0.0,0.09787189407367489,0.44831026916502625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03848100235041227,0.07442194630955389,0.07935652925566285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409676585667921,0.08182296576169541,0.0,0.0,0.05219944027482952,0.0,0.0,

So if I say a movie is the 6th worst movie I've ever seen, it's pretty unspeakably bad.  This is the only movie I've ever seen where there's a second set of starting credits that take place in the middle of the movie.  Essentially, one movie is used inside of another here.  I mean, how low can you go.  At least I got to learn some interesting information about Pirate's World in the middle of this shameful experiment in filmography.  The included Punch short is disappointing, but the movie is too laughable to be.",0.5,142,0.08810040652682039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13384039533140096,0.0,0.0,0.08036056711380415,0.07627159106970567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626645754134311,0.0,0.0892569526896965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17274602235415565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10710354024472382,0.08332906528919458,0.16394836575956148,0.0,0.30159330131647655,0.048890062920450325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003612869368656,0.0,0.10581315955161157,0.5206042278473281,0.10685565582636375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3896687366301024,0.0,0.07183102711060313,0.09931163788863233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047002303166441,0.09012157476335006,0.0,0.09981002505367223,0.06004394591601922,0.4654459412892617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08557316576331458,0.0,0.09443165459465014,0.0,0.14605457049160098,0.10855398623066272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10951339971579602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07027544371856757,

I purchased the dvd as soon as it was available and have already worn out one copy and purchased a second.  The performances are uniformly good with Connie Selleca and a hilarious Rue McClanahan the obvious standouts; and the story is warm and funny and brings out all of those good holiday feelings we all cherish during this season.  Also great for comic relief is the romance between Sellecca and Randy Travis, who spend a large part of the movie at cross purposes while doing their best not to fall in love again.

It's a solid workout, by the end I was drenched in sweat. I would recommend this to intermediate exercisers and up.There are some negative aspects ,that IMO, could make or break your decision on purchasing this.  Her cueing gets ahead of itself, which causes some confusion.  The choreography can be a little complex at times, so if coordination isn't your strong point...skip this workout. Also, if you have knee problems, definately steer clear of this.Overall, I enjoyed the 500 calorie workout.  For me, some of the lunges seemed dangerous on the knees. Other than that, this is a keeper for me!

1501370,B005S9ELM6,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,0,0,1365897600,ALMOST FORGOTTEN,"For those of us alive when the hostage crisis took place in the seventies we've not forgotten what tensions in the Middle East were like at that time. We had a president who showed a weak America and that was played upon by terrorists who had captured and held captive American hostages for 444 days in 1979 through 1981. Most born since those dates have little or no idea that it happened. It's become a forgotten page in history. Not so any longer.ARGO tells the story not of those particular hostages but of 6 Americans who escaped from the Embassy before it was taken. Hidden in the home of the Canadian ambassador, a team of CIA operatives worked on plans to help them escape. With streets to overflowing with hostile protestors and terrorists the straight and easy methods were out. There was little that could be done and no plan seemed fool proof. But one might do the trick.Ben Affleck (who also directed) stars as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who has planned escapes before. A chance look at a trade magazine and a plot forms in his head: pretend that a Hollywood production company is making a science fiction movie and take the 6 people out as members of the crew scouting locations. All it takes is finding a way to make it appear they came into the country so they can be taken out. With nothing but bad ideas on how to rescue these 6 people, this becomes the best worst idea.Mendez sets about by recruiting a friend in John Chambers (John Goodman), the special effects man responsible for the make up in PLANET OF THE APES. He in turn helps Mendez connect with Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer of note in the past who agrees to help them set up a fake production company and to find the right script. Everything has to appear on the up and up to convince the Iranian government. A script is found, an office opened, ads posted in the trade magazines and a party with a reading of the movie is even held all to make it seem legit.Backgrounds for each of the ""crew"" members are formed and set up for Mendez to provide each of the 6 still in Iran. They will have to know their cover stories to the letter if the plan is to work. Once Mendez gets the okay and lands in country, this becomes a point of contention among the 6. While their options are non-existent, a few have a problem coming to terms with this plan. Mendez assures them he will get them out.The majority of the film involves the set up of the escape of the 6. The planning, the bureaucracy and the involvement of so many people with so many possibilities of the plan failing are covered. What is amazing is that these details are spun here in such a way as to never be boring or seem like the film lasts too long, unlike ZERO DARK THIRTY. Instead, Affleck has the pacing of the film done to perfection.The last portion of the film involves the group as they finally leave the ambassador's home and head for the airport. Affleck again does a magnificent job as the tension mounts from minute to minute. Whether you know the results of this mission or not you soon find your palms sweating and heart racing as you wait to see if they escape or not.ARGO was nominated for and won the Best Picture Oscar this past year. For once I have to agree with a win in that category. This is truly a movie worth watching more than once. The only sad note is that Affleck was overlooked when it came to direction. That award went to Ang Lee for LIFE OF PI. While I enjoyed that movie as well, I think perhaps Affleck should have edged out Lee. Perhaps one day Hollywood will recognize his talents behind the camera as well as in front.",0.0,670,0.024621610482026032,0.0,0.04177486077113267,0.028660391860762476,0.02265119064812838,0.19949153989321933,0.08051925596073241,0.17063733945457044,0.04491708176144341,0.06394735779990882,0.0,0.0,0.05920346406333213,0.05253901182787415,0.04694698314931482,0.02494483293070053,0.02922667306779874,0.0,0.0,0.027614252876182164,0.09318565661953206,0.0,0.15297719646730668,0.0455526956224447,0.02784960610836895,0.0,0.0,0.05573732365845424,0.07241655474248956,0.0998427813736155,0.04967358136203057,0.0,0.0,0.04825534803958252,0.029932457216855057,0.046576306926739725,0.2443680166019226,0.02926648871568957,0.1264303948485525,0.09564387875007478,0.0,0.0,0.04570272884013054,0.0,0.061551977252436545,0.0,0.024708575579606182,0.029571831743581394,0.07274719276948301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05592891432561702,0.09847899607738397,0.28586659925851843,0.05639273581331992,0.04014954390710352,0.02775483747264581,0.09995343902148597,0.0,0.12182455818673382,0.0949680418519286,0.0,0.0,0.026790506061734175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995652304792204,0.0,0.02632145702673959,0.02789412280776078,0.16780610969121926,0.5912690014543694,0.056739700769104603,0.11952951460884732,0.0,0.02391531705925511,0.11805463072717148,0.07917305407307794,0.02552000736075285,0.28572729909802824,0.030337816482480396,0.0,0.15451084295907366,0.0,0.09109378353058396,0.0,0.061211891673709516,0.059558236908513564,0.05194032301891144,0.05784086485740922,0.04921514990780908,0.05081699965773897,0.0,0.1429033143764564,0.07886561431081882,0.14319755567798864,0.0,0.058920089131371735,

CLAIR's ""signature"" series each consist of three public domain films (on a single DVD) that are good, but not necessarily the featured artist's best work-- sometimes the actor is far from the lead character (such is the case with two of these titles).CONTENTS:AGENCY--  A millionaire buys an advertising agency and replaces personnel with allies chosen to subliminally slant product ads to further the owner's political aims and beliefs. A copywriter catches on to this scheme and ends up dead. 1970s cynicism is reflected in this mediocre Canadian-made whodunit.GUNG HO! -- Mitchum is a lowly 10th banana here. A decent cast in an idealized rendering of a WWII true event: the Marine assault of a Japanese-held island that occurred two months after Pearl Harbor.AERIAL GUNNER--  This one's even less of a Robert Mitchum film. He gets no screen credit for a bit role in this dual/genre WWII-era tale of a training camp love triangle and Pacific airwar story.For a similar set, check out theRONALD REAGAN SIGNATURE COLLECTION, also from St. Clair..Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 viewer poll ratings found at a film resource website.(5.2) Agency (Canada-1980) - Robert Mitchum/Lee Majors/Valerie Perrine/Saul Rubinek(6.0) Gung Ho!

I half wonder if this was purposeful considering what it is (and considering the original movie was a musical).In the end, the movie was enjoyable.  There were a few parts that had my 5 and 8 year olds jumping out of their seats and the ending was straight up fist pumping, hell yeah, exciting.I hope they continue adapting the story in the series in this new format.
